Arsenic (As) is a toxic metalloid element that is present in air, water and 
soil. Inorganic arsenic tends to be more toxic than organic arsenic. Examples of 
methylated organic arsenicals include monomethylarsonic acid [MMA(V)] and 
dimethylarsinic acid [DMA(V)]. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated oxidative 
damage is a common denominator in arsenic pathogenesis. In addition, arsenic 
induces morphological changes in the integrity of mitochondria. Cascade 
mechanisms of free radical formation derived from the superoxide radical, 
combined with glutathione-depleting agents, increase the sensitivity of cells to 
arsenic toxicity. When both humans and animals are exposed to arsenic, they 
experience an increased formation of ROS/RNS, including peroxyl radicals (ROO•), 
the superoxide radical, singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radical (OH•) via the Fenton 
reaction, hydrogen peroxide, the dimethylarsenic radical, the dimethylarsenic 
peroxyl radical and/or oxidant-induced DNA damage. Arsenic induces the formation 
of oxidized lipids which in turn generate several bioactive molecules (ROS, 
peroxides and isoprostanes), of which aldehydes [malondialdehyde (MDA) and 
4-hydroxy-nonenal (HNE)] are the major end products. This review discusses 
aspects of chronic and acute exposures of arsenic in the etiology of cancer, 
cardiovascular disease (hypertension and atherosclerosis), neurological 
disorders, gastrointestinal disturbances, liver disease and renal disease, 
reproductive health effects, dermal changes and other health disorders. The role 
of antioxidant defence systems against arsenic toxicity is also discussed. 
Consideration is given to the role of vitamin C (ascorbic acid), vitamin E 
(α-tocopherol), curcumin, glutathione and antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide 
dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase in their protective roles against 
arsenic-induced oxidative stress.

Environment pollution is at its peak and is creating havoc for living beings. 
Industrial wastes containing toxic pollutants have contributed to a great extent 
in this disastrous environment pollution. Chromium (Cr3+/Cr6+) is highly toxic 
and one of the most common environmental pollutants because of its extensive use 
in industries especially tanneries. Lack of efficient treatment methods has 
resulted in extensive chromium pollution. Bioremediation of chromium using 
bacteria is very thoughtful due to its eco-friendly and cost-effective outcome. 
Bacteria possess numerous mechanisms such as biosorption, reduction, efflux or 
bioaccumulation, naturally or acquired to counter the toxicity of chromium. This 
review focuses on the bacterial responses against chromium toxicity and scope 
for their application in bioremediation. The differences and similarities 
between Gram negative and positive bacteria against chromium are also 
highlighted. Further, the knowledge gap and future prospects are also discussed 
in order to fill these gaps and overcome the problem associated with real-time 
applicability of bacterial bioremediation.

Living beings have been devastated by environmental pollution, which has reached 
its peak. The disastrous pollution of the environment is in large part due to 
industrial wastes containing toxic pollutants. The widespread use of chromium 
(Cr (III)/Cr (VI)) in industries, especially tanneries, makes it one of the most 
dangerous environmental pollutants. Chromium pollution is widespread due to 
ineffective treatment methods. Bioremediation of chromium (Cr) using bacteria is 
very thoughtful due to its eco-friendly and cost-effective outcome. In order to 
counter chromium toxicity, bacteria have numerous mechanisms, such as the 
ability to absorb, reduce, efflux, or accumulate the metal. In this review 
article, we focused on chromium toxicity on human and environmental health as 
well as its bioremediation mechanism.

The need of the hour relies on finding new but sustainable ways to curb rising 
pollution levels. The accelerated levels of urbanization and increase in 
population deplete the finite resources essential for human sustenance. In this 
aspect, water is one of the non-renewable sources that is running out very fast 
and is polluted drastically day by day. One way of tackling the problem is to 
reduce the pollution levels by decreasing the usage of chemicals in the process, 
and the other is to find ways to reuse or reduce the contaminants in the 
effluent by treatment methods. Most of the available water recycling or 
treatment methods are not sustainable. Some of them even use toxic chemicals in 
the processing steps. Treatment of organic wastes from industries is a 
challenging task as they are hard to remove. Electrocoagulation is one of the 
emerging water treatment technologies that is highly sustainable and has a 
comparatively cheaper operating cost. Being a broad-spectrum treatment process, 
it is suitable for treating the most common water pollutants ranging from oils, 
bacteria, heavy metals, and others. The process is also straightforward, where 
electrical current is used to coagulate the contaminates. The presence of 
carcinogens in these waste water increases the need for its treatment towards 
further use. The present investigation is made as an extensive analysis of the 
emerging carcinogens and their various sources from process industries, 
especially in the form of organic waste and their removal by electrocoagulation 
and its coupled techniques. The paper also aims to ascertain why the 
electrocoagulation technique may be a better alternative compared with other 
methods for the removal of carcinogens in organic wastewater, an analysis which 
has not been explored before.

Heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants are causing detrimental effects 
on the environment. The seepage of heavy metals through untreated industrial 
waste destroys the crops and lands. Moreover, incineration and combustion of 
several products are responsible for primary and secondary emissions of 
pollutants. This review has gathered the remediation strategies, current 
bioremediation technologies, and their primary use in both in situ and ex situ 
methods, followed by a detailed explanation for bioremediation over other 
techniques. However, an amalgam of bioremediation techniques and nanotechnology 
could be a breakthrough in cleaning the environment by degrading heavy metals 
and persistant organic pollutants.

The initial cyanide (CN-) concentration and amount of co-contaminants in GCTs 
can inhibit bacterial growth and reduce the CN--degrading ability of bacteria. 
Several microorganisms can biotransform a wide range of organic and inorganic 
industrial contaminants into nontoxic compounds. However, active enzymatic CN- 
metabolism processes are mostly constrained by the physical and chemical 
characteristics of GCTs. High concentrations of toxic metal co-contaminants, 
such as, Pb, and Cr, and factors, such as pH, temperature, and oxygen 
concentration create oxidative stress and limit the CN--degrading potential of 
cyanotrophic strains. The effects of such external and internal factors on the 
CN--degrading ability of bacteria hinder the selection of suitable 
microorganisms for CN- biodegradation. Therefore, understanding the effects of 
the physicochemical properties of GCTs on cyanobacteria strains can help 
identify suitable microbes and favorable environmental conditions to promote 
microbial growth and can also help design efficient CN- biodegradation 
processes. In this review, we present a detailed analysis of the physicochemical 
properties of GCTs and their effects on microbial CN- degradation.

Bioremediation offers the possibility of using living organisms (bacteria, 
fungi, algae,or plants), but primarily microorganisms, to degrade or remove 
environmental contaminants, and transform them into nontoxic or less-toxic 
forms. The major advantages of bioremediation over conventional physicochemical 
and biological treatment methods include low cost, good efficiency, minimization 
of chemicals, reduced quantity of secondary sludge, regeneration of cell 
biomass, and the possibility of recover-ing pollutant metals. Leather 
industries, which extensively employ chromium compounds in the tanning process, 
discharge spent-chromium-laden effluent into nearby water bodies. Worldwide, 
chromium is known to be one of the most common inorganic contaminants of 
groundwater at pollutant hazardous sites. Hexavalent chromium poses a health 
risk to all forms of life. Bioremediation of chromium extant in tannery waste 
involves different strategies that include biosorption, 
bioaccumulation,bioreduction, and immobilization of biomaterial(s). Biosorption 
is a nondirected physiochemical interaction that occurs between metal species 
and the cellular components of biological species. It is metabolism-dependent 
when living biomass is employed, and metabolism-independent in dead cell 
biomass. Dead cell biomass is much more effective than living cell biomass at 
biosorping heavy metals, including chromium. Bioaccumulation is a metabolically 
active process in living organisms that works through adsorption, intracellular 
accumulation, and bioprecipitation mechanisms. In bioreduction processes, 
microorganisms alter the oxidation/reduction state of toxic metals through 
direct or indirect biological and chemical process(es).Bioreduction of Cr6+ to 
Cr3+ not only decreases the chromium toxicity to living organisms, but also 
helps precipitate chromium at a neutral pH for further physical removal,thus 
offering promise as a bioremediation strategy. However, biosorption, 
bioaccumulation, and bioreduction methods that rely on free cells for 
bioremediation suffer from Cr6 toxicity, and cell damage. Therefore, 
immobilization of microbial cell biomass enhances bioremediation and renders 
industrial bioremediation processes more economically viable from reduced 
free-cells toxicity, easier separation of biosorbents from the tannery effluent, 
ability to achieve multiple biosorption cycles, and desorption (elution) of 
metal(s) from matrices for reuse. Thus, microbial bioremediation can be a cost 
competitive strategy and beneficial bioresource for removing many hazardous 
contaminants from tannery and other industrial wastes.

A large number of aromatic compounds and organic nitriles, the two groups of 
compounds covered in this review, are intermediates, products, by-products or 
waste products of the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, agriculture and 
the processing of fossil fuels. The majority of these synthetic substances 
(xenobiotics) are toxic and their release and accumulation in the environment 
pose a serious threat to living organisms. Bioremediation using various 
bacterial strains of the genus Rhodococcus has proved to be a promising option 
for the clean-up of polluted sites. The large genomes of rhodococci, their 
redundant and versatile catabolic pathways, their ability to uptake and 
metabolize hydrophobic compounds, to form biofilms, to persist in adverse 
conditions and the availability of recently developed tools for genetic 
engineering in rhodococci make them suitable industrial microorganisms for 
biotransformations and the biodegradation of many organic compounds. The 
peripheral and central catabolic pathways in rhodococci are characterized for 
each type of aromatics (hydrocarbons, phenols, halogenated, nitroaromatic, and 
heterocyclic compounds) in this review. Pathways involved in the hydrolysis of 
nitrile pollutants (aliphatic nitriles, benzonitrile analogues) and the 
corresponding enzymes (nitrilase, nitrile hydratase) are described in detail. 
Examples of regulatory mechanisms for the expression of the catabolic genes are 
given. The strains that efficiently degrade the compounds in question are 
highlighted and examples of their use in biodegradation processes are presented.

Soil and water pollution is of significant concern worldwide because of the 
consequences of environmental degradation and harmful effects on human health. 
Water bodies are very much polluted by various organic and inorganic pollutants 
by different human activities, including industrial wastes. Environmental 
pollution remains high because of urbanization-induced industrial developments 
and human lifestyle. It accumulates pollutants in the environment including 
plants and living organisms. Even mothers' milk is poisoned because of the 
uncontrolled, widespread increase in pollution. The discharge levels of organic 
hydrophobic contaminants in the water and soil are increasing rapidly. This 
severe pollution must be remediated to upgrade the environment and ensure the 
safety of human beings. It is vital to eradicate soil and water pollution to 
guarantee sufficient food and water. Different techniques available to remove 
the pollutants vary according to the type of pollutants. Hydrophobic 
contaminants are more dangerous than heavy metals and other pollutants; they 
cannot be easily removed, requiring special care. Hydrophobic organoxenobiotics 
released in the environment pose severe contamination in soil and water. 
Therefore, developing efficient and cost-effective processes is necessary to 
remove hydrophobic contaminants from soil and water. With nanoparticle-mediated 
remediation techniques, the green-synthesized nanoparticles exhibit improved 
performance. This review consolidates reports on the remediation techniques of 
hydrophobic contaminants, focusing on green-synthesized remediation agents. The 
very limited works on green synthesis of polymeric nanoparticles, particularly 
polyurethane-based materials for organic contaminants removal demand more 
attention in this area. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Consolidated the effects of 
hydrophobic organic and plastic contaminants on environment degradation. 
Summarized the advantages of green synthesized polymer nanoparticles for 
efficient removal of hydrophobic contaminants. Discussed the different sources 
of pollution and remediation techniques referring 112 research works.

Globally, the rapid increase in the human population has given rise to a variety 
of industries, which have produced a variety of wastes. Due to their detrimental 
effects on both human and environmental health, pollutants from industry have 
taken centre stage among the various types of waste produced. The amount of 
waste produced has therefore increased the demand for effective waste 
management. In order to create valuable chemicals for sustainable waste 
management, trash must be viewed as valuable addition. One of the most 
environmentally beneficial and sustainable choices is to use garbage to make 
biosurfactants. The utilization of waste in the production of biosurfactant 
provides lower processing costs, higher availability of feedstock and 
environmental friendly product along with its characteristics. The current 
review focuses on the use of industrial wastes in the creation of sustainable 
biosurfactants and discusses how biosurfactants are categorized. Waste 
generation in the fruit industry, agro-based industries, as well as 
sugar-industry and dairy-based industries is documented. Each waste and 
wastewater are listed along with its benefits and drawbacks. This review places 
a strong emphasis on waste management, which has important implications for the 
bioeconomy. It also offers the most recent scientific literature on industrial 
waste, including information on the role of renewable feedstock for the 
production of biosurfactants, as well as the difficulties and unmet research 
needs in this area.

Toxic compensation bills.

Anderson RC.

Congress has demonstrated interest in toxic compensation legislation, but not 
enough agreement to make significant progress. Advocates of reform claim that 
the legal system is heavily weighed against victims who seek compensation 
through the courts. Proposed reforms include a compensation fund and a cause of 
action in federal court. Critics have questioned whether these changes in the 
law would represent an improvement. Existing income replacement, medical cost 
reimbursement, and survivor insurance programs largely cover the losses of 
individuals with chronic disease. Thus, the need for an additional compensation 
is not clear. Furthermore, experience with compensation funds such as the Black 
Lung Fund suggests that political rather than scientific criteria may be used to 
determine eligibility. Finally, under the proposed financing mechanisms the 
compensation funds that are being debated would not increase incentives for care 
in the handling of hazardous wastes or toxic substances.

In the last two decades, water use has increased at twice the rate of population 
growth. The freshwater resources are getting polluted by contaminants like heavy 
metals, pesticides, hydrocarbons, organic waste, pathogens, fertilizers, and 
emerging pollutants. Globally more than 80% of the wastewater is released into 
the environment without proper treatment. Rapid industrialization has a dramatic 
effect on developing countries leading to significant losses to economic and 
health well-being in terms of toxicological impacts on humans and the 
environment through air, water, and soil pollution. This article provides an 
overview of physical, chemical, and biological processes to remove wastewater 
contaminants. A physical and/or chemical technique alone appears ineffective for 
recovering useful resources from wastewater containing complex components. There 
is a requirement for more processes or processes combined with membrane and 
biological processes to enhance operational efficiency and quality. More 
processes or those that are combined with biological and membrane-based 
processes are required to enhance operational efficiencies and quality. This 
paper intends to provide an exhaustive review of electrochemical technologies 
including microbial electrochemical technologies. It provides comprehensive 
information for the recovery of metals, nutrients, sulfur, hydrogen, and heat 
from industrial effluents. This article aims to give detailed information into 
the advancements in electrochemical processes to energy use, improve restoration 
performance, and achieve commercialization. It also covers bottlenecks and 
perspectives of this research area.

Tanning and other leather processing methods utilize a large amount of 
freshwater, dyes, chemicals, and salts and produce toxic waste, raising 
questions regarding their environmental sensitivity and eco-friendly nature. 
Total suspended solids, total dissolved solids, chemical oxygen demand, and ions 
such as chromium, sulfate, and chloride turn tannery wastewater exceedingly 
toxic for any living species. Therefore, it is imperative to treat tannery 
effluent, and existing plants must be examined and upgraded to keep up with 
recent technological developments. Different conventional techniques to treat 
tannery wastewater have been reported based on their pollutant removal 
efficiencies, advantages, and disadvantages. Research on photo-assisted 
catalyst-enhanced deterioration has inferred that both homogeneous and 
heterogeneous catalysis can be established as green initiatives, the latter 
being more efficient at degrading organic pollutants. However, the scientific 
community experiences significant problems developing a feasible treatment 
technique owing to the long degradation times and low removal efficiency. Hence, 
there is a chance for an improved solution to the problem of treating tannery 
wastewater through the development of a hybrid technology that uses flocculation 
as the primary treatment, a unique integrated photo-catalyst in a 
precision-designed reactor as the secondary method, and finally, membrane-based 
tertiary treatment to recover the spent catalyst and reclaimable water. This 
review gives an understanding of the progressive advancement of a cutting-edge 
membrane-based system for the management of tanning industrial waste effluents 
towards the reclamation of clean water. Adaptable routes toward sludge disposal 
and the reviews on techno-economic assessments have been shown in detail, 
strengthening the scale-up confidence for implementing such innovative hybrid 
systems.

Relationships between toxic pollutant emissions during industrial processes and 
toxic pollutant dietary intakes and adverse health burdens have not yet been 
quantitatively clarified. Polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) are typical 
industrial pollutants that are carcinogenic and of increasing concern. In this 
study, we established an interpretable machine learning model for quantifying 
the contributions of industrial emissions and dietary intakes of PCNs to health 
effects. We used the SHapley Additive exPlanations model to achieve 
individualized interpretability, enabling us to evaluate the specific 
contributions of individual feature values towards PCNs concentration levels. A 
strong relationship between PCN dietary intake and body burden was found using a 
robust large-scale PCN diet survey database for China containing the results of 
the analyses of 17,280 dietary samples and 4480 breast milk samples. Industrial 
emissions and dietary intake contributed 12 % and 52 %, respectively, of the PCN 
burden in breast milk. The model quantified the contributions of food 
consumption and industrial emissions to PCN exposure, which will be useful for 
performing accurate health risk assessments and developing reduction strategies 
of PCNs.

The reuse and recycling of industrial solid wastes such as scrap metal is 
supported and encouraged both internationally and domestically, especially when 
such wastes can be used as substitutes for raw material. However, scrap metal 
processing facilities, such as mini-mills, have been identified as a source of 
mercury (Hg) emissions in the United States. This research aims to better define 
some of the key issues related to the source and nature of mercury in the scrap 
metal waste stream. Overall, it is difficult to pinpoint the key mercury sources 
feeding into scrap metal recycling facilities, quantify their associated mercury 
concentrations, or determine which chemical forms are most significant. 
Potential sources of mercury in scrap metal include mercury switches from 
discarded vehicles, electronic-based scrap from household appliances and related 
industrial systems, and Hg-impacted scrap metal from the oil and gas industry. 
The form of mercury associated with scrap metal varies and depends on the source 
type. The specific amount of mercury that can be adsorbed and retained by steel 
appears to be a function of both metallurgical and environmental factors. In 
general, the longer the steel is in contact with a fluid or condensate that 
contains measurable concentrations of elemental mercury, the greater the 
potential for mercury accumulation in that steel. Most mercury compounds are 
thermally unstable at elevated temperatures (i.e., above 350 °C). As such, the 
mercury associated with impacted scrap is expected to be volatilized out of the 
metal when it is heated during processing (e.g., shredding or torch cutting) or 
melted in a furnace. This release of fugitive gas (Hg vapor) and particulates, 
as well as Hg-impacted bag-house dust and control filters, could potentially 
pose an occupational exposure risk to workers at a scrap metal processing 
facility. Thus, identifying and characterizing the key sources of Hg-impacted 
scrap, and understanding the nature and extent of associated releases, represent 
a practical research need that is essential for improving the environmental 
management of Hg-impacted scrap and assessing measures to protect workers from 
potential health and safety hazards that might be posed by mercury and 
Hg-impacted scrap.

Due to the lack of normalized management, industrial waste is often co-disposed 
at open solid waste dumping sites, which could aggravate the groundwater 
pollution. In this study, 5 practical open solid waste dumping sites dealing 
with municipal solid wastes (MSW) (2 of 5) and industrial wastes mixed with MSW 
(3 of 5) were chosen to investigate the effect of waste co-disposal on the 
groundwater contamination. The industrial waste was mainly from rubber 
production, leather production, machinery industry, pharmaceutical industry and 
plastic production. 3 to 6 groundwater wells were excavated from each dumping 
site and 148 indices were analyzed, including regular chemicals, heavy metals, 
biological pollutants, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), semi-volatile organic 
compounds (SVOCs) and pesticide residues. Nemerow index analysis showed that 5 
indices were severely polluted in the groundwater from every industrial waste 
co-disposal landfill, while only 0 and 1 severely polluted index was found for 
the two MSW landfill, respectively. The principal component analysis (PCA) 
analysis indicated that 2 biological pollutant (plate-counting bacteria (TPB) 
and total coliforms (TCs)), 4 chemical pollutants (permanganate index, ammonia, 
S2- and petroleum) were closely connected with the disposal of industrial waste. 
Besides, co-disposal of industrial waste also brought in series of PAHs and 
dichloromethane, with di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate exceeding the standard limit 
(10.5 mg L-1). Attention should be paid to TPB and TCs, whose maximal 
concentrations exceeded the standard limit by extraordinary 3200 and 1600 times, 
respectively. The distribution pattern of the pollutants showed that the 
biological pollutants at the downstream area, and chemical pollutants at the 
leakage points exhibited the highest concentration, which indicated the 
downstream area and seepage points should be specially concerned for the 
industry waste co-disposed dumping sites.

Due to the very limited number of studies dealing with the chemical composition 
of industrial wastewaters, many industrial organic contaminants still escape our 
view and consequently also our control. We present here the chemical 
characterization of wastewaters from different units of a chemical complex, 
thereby contributing to the characterization of industrial pollution sources. 
The chemicals produced in the investigated complex are widely and intensively 
used and the synthesis processes are common and applied worldwide. The chemical 
composition of untreated and treated wastewaters from the chemical complex was 
investigated by applying a non-target screening which allowed for the 
identification of 39 organic contaminants. According to their application most 
of them belonged to four groups: (i) unspecific educts or intermediates of 
industrial syntheses, (ii) chemicals for the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, 
(iii) educts for the synthesis of polymers and resins, and (iv) compounds known 
as typical constituents of municipal sewage. A number of halogenated compounds 
with unknown toxicity and with very high molecular diversity belonged to the 
second group. Although these compounds were completely removed or degraded 
during wastewater treatment, they could be useful as "alarm indicators" for 
industrial accidents in pharmaceutical manufacturing units or for malfunctions 
of wastewater treatment plants. Three potential branch-specific indicators for 
polymer manufacturing were found in the outflow of the complex. Among all 
compounds, bisphenol A, which was present in the leachate water of the on-site 
waste deposit, occurred in the highest concentrations of up to 20 000 μg L(-1). 
The comparison of contaminant loads in the inflow and outflow of the on-site 
wastewater treatment facility showed that most contaminants were completely or 
at least significantly removed or degraded during the treatment, except two 
alkylthiols, which were enriched during the treatment process. The chemical 
composition of the inflow samples showed a very heterogenic composition and 
strongly varied, reflecting that large scale industrial synthesis is carried out 
in batches. The outflow contained mainly unspecific chlorinated educts or 
intermediates of industrial syntheses as well as compounds which are known as 
typical constituents of municipal wastewaters.

A critical review of the levels and patterns of industrial contaminants in biota 
from Antarctica and the Southern Ocean revealed that concentrations are low with 
respect to other regions of the world, although in some specimens/species (e.g. 
leopard seal, some invertebrates) they are occasionally high and comparable to 
those found in regions with a strong human impact; the highest levels of 
persistent organic pollutants (POPs) were detected in the vicinity of scientific 
stations. Bioconcentration prevails at the lower trophic levels of pelagic food 
webs, while biomagnification can become the main route of contamination at 
higher levels. In a benthic food web, biomagnification poses a major risk for 
organisms that accumulate lipids to overwinter, compared to those that 
accumulate glycogen. Hexachlorobenzene, DDTs and chlordanes showed similar 
concentrations and patterns in the 1980s-1990s period in organisms from Western 
and Eastern Antarctica, while the polychlorinated biphenyls time trend was 
different in a variety of species from the two regions.

Environmental pollution has become a relevant issue as the population rises and 
resources decrease. Reuse and recycling still have the greatest potential as 
they turn the waste into a new resource, representing the 'closed-loop' step of 
a circular economy (CE). Looking for new applications for agro-industry waste 
represents both an environmental issue, as its incorrect disposal is a cause of 
pollution, and a chance to exploit zero-cost natural wastes. The present review, 
with around 200 articles examined, focuses on possible reuses of these residues 
in (a) building construction, as additives to produce thermal and acoustic 
insulation panels, and (b) in water treatments, exploited for removal of 
pollutants. The selected materials (coconut, coffee, corn, cotton and rice) have 
industry production wastes with suitable applications in both sectors and huge 
worldwide availability; their reuse may thus represent a new resource, with an 
impact based on the production rate and the possible replacement of current 
inorganic materials. Along with possible implementation of the selected 
materials in the building industry and environmental engineering, a brief 
description of the production and supply chain are provided.
