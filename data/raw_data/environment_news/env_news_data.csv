 Liz Truss ‘will approve more oil drilling if she becomes PM’,"Tory leadership candidate criticised by campaigners after reports her team have met energy firms

Politics live – latest updates
","['Rob Davies', '@ByRobDavies']","Liz Truss will sign off on a push for more oil drilling in the North Sea if she wins the Conservative leadership election, according to reports, drawing criticism from environmental campaigners.Amid mounting public dismay about soaring energy bills, Truss’s policy advisers are thought to be discussing proposals to issue up to 130 new drilling licences, which typically take nearly three decades to produce any oil and gas.The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, and the Brexit opportunities minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg, have been meeting oil and gas firms to discuss how to secure energy supplies this winter, the Times reported.Truss’s plans to slash VAT are ‘regressive and flawed’, says Sunak’s teamRead moreThe discussions reportedly involve importing more gas from Norway in the short term, while ramping up domestic production. The climate change committee has previously said it takes an average of 28 years for an exploration licence to lead to oil and gas production.The Greenpeace chief UK scientist, Dr Doug Parr, said intensifying North Sea drilling would do little to bring down energy bills.“Unleashing a North Sea drilling frenzy isn’t a plan to help bill payers but a gift to the fossil fuel giants already making billions from this crisis,” he said.“New oil and gas could take a quarter of a century to pump out, will be eventually sold at global prices, and have no real impact on energy bills yet still fuel the climate crisis.”He said the UK’s dependence on gas was among the factors driving up bills and called for faster action to promote new wind and solar projects, as well as improving energy efficiency by insulating UK homes, which are among the leakiest in Europe.Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDeskHe added: “If Liz Truss really wants to help cash-strapped households, she should bring in an energy bill freeze alongside extra financial support for the poorest households, partly funded by properly taxing the astronomical profits of oil and gas companies.”Truss’s North Sea plan comes against the backdrop of a continent-wide scramble to secure gas supplies before the winter, after Vladimir Putin began choking off pipeline flows amid a geopolitical standoff over his invasion of Ukraine.The UK relies more heavily on gas than most European countries and has very little storage after the closure of the Rough facility off the Yorkshire coast in 2017. Labour has previously called on Truss to explain her part in the government’s acquiescence to the closure of Rough.",2022-08-30
Renewed Highland golf course plan has environmentalists crying 'Fore!',Scottish government rejected a new links at Coul to protect the complex dune system but investors have revived the scheme,"['Ewan Murray', '@mrewanmurray']","It is an area so tranquil that the notion of bitter dispute is hugely anomalous. The serenity of Coul - in east Sutherland, north of Dornoch – is in fact fundamental to a backdrop of unrest.When the Scottish government rejected a plan for a golf course at Coul early last year, it appeared those with grand plans had nowhere else to turn. This marked a victory for environmentalists who argued one of the most complex dune systems in Scotland and a site of special scientific interest (SSSI) should not be compromised. “The harmful impacts to protected habitats and species would outweigh the potential socio-economic benefits,” said Kevin Stewart, then planning minister. Anne McCall, the director of RSPB Scotland, said: “These damaging proposals threatened a site of global importance for nature and should never have made it this far.”The rich v the very, very rich: the rebellion at Wentworth golf clubRead moreWith American investors key to the project, comparisons were not unreasonably – if unhelpfully to those pursuing a golf course – drawn with Donald Trump’s controversial development in Aberdeenshire. One glance across social media illustrates the depth of feeling attached to Coul and acrimony as attached. One golfer’s paradise is someone else’s idea of vandalism on sacred land.Unbowed, a group of individuals want to bring Coul Links back before the planners. Edward Abel Smith, a London-based landowner, is working in conjunction with the newly formed Communities for Coul. He now wants to build an eco-friendly hotel and will, should planning be granted, hand over his territory for 18 holes at a long-term peppercorn rent. The multimillion dollar question, though, is why this scheme will succeed now when the previous one in early 2020 so publicly failed?“I wouldn’t say we are confident but we feel strongly about the overall benefits that the development would bring,” says Communities for Coul’s Gordon Sutherland. “We want this golf course as a catalyst for economic development. The number of jobs forecast are calculated by businesses prepared to invest; there is almost £50m of private investment lined up and 180 jobs, 108 of which would be full-time.“It would be such an important thing for this area, which had a decreasing population and ageing demographic even before Covid. It’s even more important now to create jobs in this area. We are prepared to fail but we will do everything we can to succeed.”Several developers are interested in this scheme but, once again, it hinges on planning consent. It will be several months before a new application is submitted. Abel Smith admits he is currently presiding over a “loss-making farm”. The issue is, protected links land adjacent to the farm is fundamental for a renowned golf course. “The land has been in my family for a long time,” he says. “I genuinely believe the course is the best option for the area, whilst admitting my vested interest by way of the hotel. I will go as far as the community take this. I don’t see there being other options to benefit the land, the area or the environment in any comparable way.”Highland councillors have previously offered heavy backing. The appetite within Sutherland for the golf course appears strong. “Of the 90,000 or so who signed the online petition against the [rejected] development, less than 0.15% live within the IV25 postcode,” say Communities for Coul. Sutherland adds: “We feel the vast majority of people who live locally support this.” Politically, the prominence or otherwise of the Scottish Greens after upcoming elections could be significant.That Tom Dargie, an ecologist and the chair of Not Coul sits in the opposite camp to Sutherland and Abel Smith feels like gross understatement. Dargie had previously estimated the loss of 48 hectares of dune habitat, should the course go ahead.“As before, sound economics with decent science and respect for protected land are awol from the Coul golf revival plan,” Dargie insists. “Not Coul individuals, possibly with new objectives under a new name, want to campaign for community-led management of all protected wildlife and habitats at Coul Links. We want to enable a vibrant, dynamic, golf-free and self-functioning dune ecosystem, with community initiatives involving many nearby, outside designated land. In short we seek respectful change and living-wage jobs approved by the majority in our community whilst doing no damage to our local supposedly protected environment.”Dargie believes precious little has changed between the rejection of the previous plan and the arrival of Communities for Coul. He adds: “Much is being made in the press of damage to the local economy from Covid-19 lockdown and Brexit but those claims lack substance and are without proven information on local severe effects which are worse than elsewhere in Scotland. Instead, based on the local business results from the restricted 2020 staycation summer, other unquoted local business people feel our economy here will likely boom in staycation 2021 because it is already geared to family tourism, couples and golf on really excellent courses.” True though that may be, it of course ignores the longer term.Where Dargie and Abel Smith do agree is on the poor and overgrown condition of a protected site due to no management plan being in place with NatureScot, previously Scottish Natural Heritage. “I have a productive relationship with NatureScot,” adds Abel Smith. “But they are incredibly stretched.“I haven’t deliberately neglected the land. I would love to see it protected and looked after properly. In my view a golf course is the best way to do that; it takes up a small area and would provide capital to maintain the rest of the SSSI.”Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.In nearby Royal Dornoch, Sutherland houses one of the finest golf venues in the world. Its vice-captain, the professor of economics David Bell, has sent a letter to the local MP, Jamie Stone, regarding golf and the post-pandemic scene. “The golf courses around the Dornoch Firth can play a vital role in recovery from what has been the most devastating economic collapse to affect this area, possibly since the Clearances [eviction of Highland tenants in the 18th and 19th centuries],” says Bell. “The golf industry provides vital employment, allowing younger people to stay in the area. This is particularly important in Sutherland, which faces serious demographic decline. By 2040, its population is likely to be around half of what it was at the time of the Clearances. Highland Council’s own estimates show Sutherland’s population declining by 10.7% between 2021 and 2041.”Dornoch, just like the neighbouring and excellent courses at Golspie, Tain and Brora would benefit from increased footfall. In short, the economic argument here is compelling. Whether that is sufficient to circumvent lingering and deep environmental concerns remains to be seen.",2021-03-22
" Visiting green spaces deters mental health drug use, researchers find","Positive effects were stronger among those reporting the lowest annual household income, says Finnish study","['Damien Gayle', '@damiengayle']","Visits to parks, community gardens and other urban green spaces may lower city dwellers’ use of drugs for anxiety, insomnia, depression, high blood pressure, and asthma, research has found.Researchers in Finland found that visiting such areas three to four times a week cuts people’s chances of turning to drugs for mental health problems or high blood pressure by a third, and for asthma by about a quarter.Moreover, the positive effects of visiting green spaces were stronger among those reporting the lowest annual household income, the researchers found.Scientist enlists pupils to see how hedges can make greener schoolsRead moreThe findings correlate with a growing body of evidence that a lack of access to green spaces is linked to a range of health problems. Access tends to be unequal, with poorer communities having fewer opportunities to be in nature.To investigate the link, researchers from the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare drew on the responses of 16,000 randomly selected residents of Helsinki, Espoo and Vantaa – three cities that make up the largest urban area in Finland – to the Helsinki capital region environmental health survey in 2015-16.The survey gathered information on how city dwellers aged at least 25 experienced residential green and blue spaces within a 1km (0.62-mile) radius of their homes. Green areas included forests, gardens, parks, castle parks, cemeteries, zoos, natural grasslands, moors and wetlands; and blue areas included sea, lakes, and rivers.Respondents were asked to report their use of prescribed drugs for anxiety, insomnia and depression, and for high blood pressure and asthma. They were then asked how often they spent time or exercised outdoors in green spaces, during May and September, with options ranging from never to five or more times a week.The researchers chose prescription drugs as a proxy for ill health. They picked those for anxiety, insomnia and depression, and high blood pressure and asthma in particular because they are used to treat common but potentially serious health issues.They found a strong correlation between visits to green spaces and lower odds of using such drugs. Compared with less than one weekly visit, visiting three to four times weekly was associated with 33% lower odds of using mental health drugs, 36% lower odds of using blood pressure drugs, and 26% lower odds of using asthma drugs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bought too much red cabbage? Turn it into a festive nut roast – recipe,This fantastic vegan centrepiece makes full use of those outer cabbage leaves that all too often just get thrown away,['Tom Hunt'],"I devised today’s nut roast for Oddbox, a veg box outfit that supports farmers by buying wonky fruit and veg that they might otherwise find hard to shift. It’s moist, flavourful and a fun use for outer cabbage leaves, which often get thrown away; it’s also a wonderful vegan centrepiece for a celebratory table.Chest-nut roastThe outer leaves from a cabbage, which are all too often pulled off and discarded, are the ideal tool for wrapping a nut roast, and help keep the filling moist. Nut roast can sometimes be a little dry and unsatisfying, but this version, featuring chestnuts, has a lovely, moist texture and tastes meaty and satisfying because of thesage, nutmeg and Marmite; inspired by recipes for vegan haggis, I’ve also added barley and lentils.Although delicious when fresh, I think it’s even better if made a couple of days in advance, giving it time to set firmly and for the flavours to develop as they mingle. Once baked, it will keep in the fridge for up to five days, or freeze indefinitely (defrost in the fridge overnight). Reheat at 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5 for 30 minutes, until piping hot right through.If you have any leftovers, turn them into a rich soup: finely chop the red cabbage casing, then add to a pan with the crumbled up filling and enough boiling water to create a thick soup.

‘This year has been very good’: readers’ UK butterfly sightings,"Readers share their favourite sightings over the summer, after news that numbers have risen since last year

UK butterfly numbers bounce back after last year’s all-time low
",['Guardian readers'],"‘Constant companions to our gardening’A peacock butterfly perched on a yellow ragwort, pictured on 9 August. Photograph: Guardian communityWe try to encourage as many pollinators as possible to visit our allotment. As well as growing lots of fruit and veg we have planted many different flowers. Across the summer we saw some unusual moths, such as the ghost moth, and then from August onwards the butterflies started to appear. We mostly spotted red admiral, peacock and small tortoiseshell butterflies. They particularly liked the cosmos and the corn marigolds. They also liked the ragwort, which later had cinnabar moth caterpillars. On sunny days they were constant companions to our gardening. Although we have seen large white butterflies, too, we don’t seem to have had any problems with caterpillars eating our veg. This may be beginner’s luck. Jess and Ian, Scottish Borders ‘I was delighted by the numbers of butterflies’A brown argus butterfly, pictured on 17 July. Photograph: Allan Ferguson/Guardian communityI allowed the grass on the lawn to the front of my house to grow and I planted some wild flowers into it, field scabious, knapweed, bird’s foot trefoil and meadow cranesbill among others. I was delighted by the numbers of butterflies that came to nectar on the flowers, there were lots of meadow browns, gatekeepers, common blues, large and small whites – but I was especially pleased to see about a dozen brown argus, which took up home here for most of July and August. I have been searching for their eggs or caterpillars on the cranesbills, so far without success, but I shall keep looking as it would be nice to know whether they are breeding here. Allan Ferguson, Bishops Stortford, Hertfordshire ‘I was lucky enough to see 11 different species’Marie’s sightings at RSPB Minsmere on 16 July. Photograph: Marie Baynham-Davies/Guardian communityOver the summer I went to RSPB Minsmere, mainly to look for rare bird species, but on one visit on 16 July I was lucky enough to see 11 different species of butterfly. I sadly didn’t see a small tortoiseshell all summer, though, which used to be one of the most common to spot. Most of the butterflies were on or near nettles and brambles, showing the importance of leaving wild parts in gardens.The rarest of those 11 species is probably the white admiral (top right, circled in red). It’s only the second time I’ve seen one, so I was really happy. I believe the silver-washed fritillary is fairly common, if you know where to look, but I’ve never had one in my garden so it was exciting to see it, too. My favourite is the peacock, bottom right. It’s one of the more common butterflies but so beautiful; it looks tropical and exotic.

Photograph: Sean O’Sullivan/Guardian communityA comma butterfly, pictured on 8 September 2023. Photograph: Sean O’Sullivan/Guardian communityOur fig tree has had a bumper crop this year. We were away for a week visiting family and found that quite a lot of the ripe fruit had gone beyond the ideal picking stage, and insects such as tiny flies and wood lice had begun to feast on them. Most notable, though, was the profusion of wasps and red admiral butterflies gorging themselves on the very overripe fruits. They were often sharing the same single fruit, and from time to time flying around before settling back on that same one or elsewhere in the tree.We’ve still been able to pick more than enough for ourselves and to give to friends, so it’s been a real treat to share so much with the insects this year. There must have been at least a dozen red admirals at one time, and a few speckled woods trying to chase them away. I also saw one comma. Sean O’Sullivan, Banbury, Oxfordshire ‘It has certainly been a good year’A painted lady on Verbena bonariensis, pictured on 12 September. Photograph: Sally Twiss/Guardian communityIt has certainly been a good year for butterflies in our south-facing garden: we’ve seen red admiral, peacock, gatekeeper and various whites in numbers. Comma, small tortoiseshell, brimstone, speckled wood, orange tip and dark green fritillary (also hummingbird hawk moths) were also present. They were attracted by plenty of nectar-rich flowers and food plants, such as nettles and hedge garlic. Sally Twiss, the Blackdown Hills, south-west England ‘A very rare sighting’The Camberwell beauty, photographed on 18 July.We saw a Camberwell beauty in our garden on 18 July at 11.58am. We took it at a distance so as not to disturb it. We reported the sighting to the Dorset Butterfly Conservation organisation and the photograph was published on their gallery. It is my understanding that a Camberwell beauty is a very rare sighting as there is no evidence that it breeds in this country.

Photograph: Guardian communityThis photo of a marbled white butterfly was taken on Ventnor Down on 8 July 2023. On the same day I also saw a small copper, common blue and a six-spot burnet moth. In my view, this year has been very good for butterflies as they are plentiful in our area. We live adjacent to downland so we are well placed to observe wildlife.

"Country diary: Willow tits are here, but good luck with seeing one","Tittesworth Reservoir, Staffordshire: It’s easy to see why these wonderful but maddeningly elusive birds have inspired great poetry",['Mark Cocker'],"The numerous bird feeders here are permanently stocked and flocked around by garden birds. Long-tailed, blue, coal and great tits pop up every second or so; and sparrows come and go with goldfinches, while reed buntings and nuthatches slip in and out among the gaps. But the briefest, most maddening, if most wonderful of all, are the willow tits.I see them usually not as they arrive, but as they leave. They zip in, but intermittently and invariably when you’ve dropped your guard. Again! All they gift you is a mean, hard, visiting call – the driest avian sound in Britain – an invertebrate Zi zi taah taah, like the small complaint of an angry insect.Despite willow tits retaining wide breeding presence through middle England, most people never see them, partly because this verve-filled fidget is so elusive, but also because it has an identical twin – the marsh tit. Almost all features said to be diagnostic of one or the other I have recorded on the wrong species. They’re so alike that not a single Briton twigged there were two black-capped, caramel-backed tits here, until two German ornithologists put us all straight in 1911.Alas for us, this never-you-see-me bird is going again. Willow tits have declined by 94% since 1970 and half of its old range is now blank. Yet continental willow tits recur throughout Eurasia’s woodlands from Amsterdam to Vladivostok. So does it matter? It matters to the poet Steve Ely, who dedicated the slenderest volume to the willow tit with his wonderful pamphlet Zi-zi Taah Taah Taah. Few British birds, except Ted Hughes’ mythopoeic Crow perhaps, are so honoured with poetry that is so densely allusive yet of such thematic grandeur. It is a sort of Waste Land for the willow tit.Try to see the beast and you’ll know why Ely wrote with such passion and why willow tits so deserve a place in our poetry and our land. But the best spot I know to do it is here, where the strange, disconcerting context makes it seem like meeting a small beloved god – say, Vincent van Gogh – in the queue at McDonald’s.

 Scaly stowaway: lizard makes an appearance at Chelsea flower show,Gardeners at the Yeo Valley Organic display were delighted to find the common brown lizard in a pile of logs,['Helena Horton'],"Visitors to Chelsea flower show come from all over the country, and range from senior royals to interested gardeners looking for some new plants.This year, however, there has been a rather special guest – a common brown lizard. Gardeners at the Yeo Valley Organic display were delighted to find him in a pile of logs.In the past, Chelsea was known as a showcase of perfectly manicured lawns and prize-winning blooms in symmetrical flower beds. But there is now a clear trend towards nature-friendly gardening. This has been somewhat controversial, with veteran gardeners including the Royal Horticultural Society rose expert Charles Quest-Ritson arguing that people do not attend flower shows to see piles of logs and patches of nettles. He believes prizes should not be given for “weeds”.But Quest-Ritson is in the minority, and this year’s show features multitudes of nature and eco-friendly gardens including a Cop26 garden and a woodland planting supported by Prince Charles, which urges visitors to “plant a tree for the Queen”.Late flowering: the Chelsea flower show is finally back – but what will it look like in autumn?Read moreYeo Valley Organic’s garden is built to attract amphibians and reptiles, as well as pollinators and insects. It seems to have achieved that aim, with the lizard making himself at home in the log pile.Sarah Mead, who created the Yeo Valley Organic garden, which is a permanent fixture at the company’s farm in Somerset, said there had been a discussion about whether the lizard had hitchhiked from the farm, where materials from the original garden were transported for the mini Chelsea version, or whether had it crawled in as a rare example of a London lizard.She said: “It’s definitely a common brown lizard – there are lots of them in the West Country so we are sure it came down from Yeo Valley in Somerset among the stone that was transported from the farm, but it’s made itself quite at home here.“As lizards are cold-blooded, they like the stone – it’s Mendip stone they’ve brought up from the dry stone walls on the farm, so a perfect environment for lizards, cool with lots of nooks and crannies. Lizards are just one example of the rich biodiversity at Yeo Valley, where they do everything to encourage wildlife.”Common lizards are found across the country, but their numbers are declining because of habitat loss. They thrive in grassland and moorland, as well as the edges of woodlands.The gardeners have enlisted experts from the Wildlife Trusts to help them keep the lizard comfortable at the busy show and teach them more about it.Features of the Somerset garden recreated at Chelsea include an open perennial meadow with flowering plants and a glade of silver birch. The design also features charred logs used as garden markers and rammed earth walls as boundaries, both highlighting the importance of soil health. The garden is designed to show how to create a beautiful and peaceful space that encourages nature and has soil health in mind. Tom Massey, who with the help of Mead designed the show garden, said: “The soil plays a pivotal role in our fight to reverse climate change but the world of microscopic activity under our feet is often overlooked. Carbon is the building block of all life and as gardeners we need to be reminded of the role we play in locking carbon into the soil, where it can help sustain life for generations to come. We want to create a beautiful garden that inspires visitors to think about using more sustainable gardening practices.” This article was amended on 29 September 2021 to remove a mistaken reference in a quote to lizards liking “cool” stone; as they are cold-blooded, it is the relative warmth of the stone that attracts them.",2019-12-01
" Climate crisis could lead to rise of smaller bees, study finds","Danger looms for larger species such as bumblebees, which have lower heat tolerance, leading to ‘cascading effects’ on ecosystems",['Agence France-Presse'],"The climate crisis could lead to more small-bodied bees but fewer bumblebees, according to research warning of potential “cascading” effects on plant pollination and across whole ecosystems.Scientists in the US trapped and studied more than 20,000 bees over eight years in an area of the Rocky Mountains to find out how different types reacted to changing climatic conditions.In research published on Wednesday in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, the authors said that while environmental conditions varied from year to year, the sub-alpine region from which they took samples was “particularly vulnerable to climate change”, with generally warming spring temperatures and earlier snow melt.Fears for bees as US set to extend use of toxic pesticides that paralyse insectsRead moreThey found that larger-bodied bees and comb-building cavity nesters declined in abundance as temperatures increased, while smaller, soil-nesting bees increased.“Our research suggests that climate-induced changes in temperature, snowpack and summer precipitation may drastically reshape bee communities,” the authors said.Researchers said the findings suggested a reduction of bigger bees, including in the families of bumblebee, leafcutters and mason bees, with higher temperatures.Declines were particularly marked for bumblebees, which the researchers said suggested “this group is more threatened under climate warming than other bees in our system”. That tallies with other studies showing that bumblebees, the dominant pollinators in many ecosystems, have a lower heat tolerance than other bees and move to cooler regions at higher altitudes as temperatures warm.Researchers said their findings suggested both bumblebees’ body size and nest behaviour could also make them more vulnerable in a warming world.More broadly, the authors said climate-driven changes to pollinator communities “could have cascading effects on pollination and ecosystem functioning”. For example, they said losing bigger bees, which tend to fly further for food, may mean a reduction in longer-distance pollination.The study was specifically focused on mountainous areas, but the researchers said other research across the US showed declines in larger bees in response to environmental changes.Insects are the world’s top pollinators: 75% of 115 top global food crops depend on animal pollination, including cocoa, coffee, almonds and cherries, according to the UN.In a landmark 2019 report, scientists concluded that nearly half of all insect species worldwide are in decline and a third could disappear altogether by century’s end. One in six species of bees have gone regionally extinct somewhere in the world.The main drivers of extinction are thought to be habitat loss and pesticide use.",2022-04-21
 UK energy industry urges ministers to stick with net zero plan,"Some rightwingers claim renewables have increased costs, but Energy UK blames over-reliance on gas","['Fiona Harvey', '  Environment correspondent']","Energy companies want the government to implement policies to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions, the industry’s leader has said, despite claims from some on the political right that high energy prices should spark a rethink.Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive of Energy UK, which represents the industry, said: “The government should press on with net zero policies. That’s something they still need to do. We are missing the carbon budgets.”She called on ministers to “tighten energy efficiency”, by insulating more homes, and changing planning and construction rules, while developing a strategy for decarbonising the UK’s fleet of gas-fired power stations.She rejected claims that renewable energy had increased costs, saying the problem was clearly an over-reliance on gas, especially for heating. She told a meeting hosted by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit: “The UK is exposed to gas because we have a huge amount of gas burned in our homes, and so helping people get off gas boilers on to other forms of heating technology is critical over the next decades to reduce our reliance on places like Russia.”She added: “But [it’s also necessary] to make our building stock much more energy-efficient. The reason we have high rates of fuel poverty in the UK isn’t just about the commodity we burn, it’s the volume of it we burn because our energy efficiency rates here are much lower than other countries.”Britain’s leaky homes make the energy crisis worse. Why have governments not fixed them? | Max WakefieldRead moreHouseholds are facing an energy price cap rise this April, likely to amount to £2,000 for the average bill, and possibly a further rise to £2,400 in October. The cost-of-living crisis has embroiled the government in calls from its own backbenches to scale back or abandon measures to promote renewable energy and pay for home insulation for poor households, even though renewable energy is many times cheaper than gas and improving home insulation would cut bills for the most vulnerable.Bim Afolami, Conservative MP for Hitchin and Harpenden, called on his fellow Tories to get behind net zero policies, saying only “a very small number” of MPs were questioning them.“Let’s be clear, in terms of delivering net zero, there is no real option other than what the government has set out. It’s a shame that it needs saying, but everyone should rest assured that the bulk of the Conservative party and the government is four-square behind this, and committed to getting it done,” he said.Q&AWhat is net zero?ShowNet zero is the commitment to reducing emissions by 100% so that the UK is producing no more carbon than it removes from the atmosphere. This will have to be achieved by reducing the amount of greenhouse gases created by activities such as industrial processes, power generation, transport and intensive agriculture, while removing emissions at the same time by capturing carbon or planting more trees.It is considered the minimum necessary to stop dangerous climate breakdown increasing the world’s temperature by more than 1.5 degrees celsius. However, there is a debate about how to get there, and how quickly, and how the costs will be spread. The current UK government wants to meet net zero by 2050, which will necessarily involve replacing gas boilers, moving to electric cars, improving insulation and lowering high-carbon consumption such as flights and meat-eating.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Michael Grubb, professor of energy and climate change at University College London, said consumers were paying unnecessarily high prices for their electricity, as well as their gas, because of the way the UK energy market works. Electricity prices are set by the gas price, even though gas makes up only about 40% of electricity generation and renewable energy prices are far lower.He said the government could ease this by changing the way the UK energy market is structured, allowing for a “pool” of green energy contracts.Ministers should levy a windfall tax on fossil fuel producers, which have seen bumper profits from the global rise in gas prices and Russia’s constraint on European supplies, added Tessa Khan, founder of campaigning organisation Uplift. Taxes on fossil fuels in the UK were far too low, and tiny compared with those of other countries, at about $2 (£1.47) a barrel in the UK compared with more than $20 a barrel for Norway.Even at such low rates, thanks to favourable rules, some fossil fuels had received payouts from the government in recent years, rather than pay tax, she said. Oil and gas producers faced no extra costs but were reaping “windfall profits” from the gas price. “These profits are being privatised.

If I were a panda, I’d be at it all the time. I think from this we can determine two things: first that you are a pervert, and second that you are unhappy.Hey, I’m not unhappy! Maybe you have more in common with pandas than you thought. Researchers have posited that the notoriously low panda libido might be down to simple contentment.How so? Well, a study published in Conservation Biology has suggested that if pandas find the perfect habitat – in this instance a cool, moderately low-lying area rich with bamboo and far from humans – then they will just happily settle down and not go anywhere.Who can blame them? That sounds perfect. Well, the worry is that by staying in the same area, they aren’t going out to search for food or mates, which reduces their genetic diversity, which will eventually lead to their extinction.So you’re saying that pandas prefer comfortable solitude to sex? Yes.And it’s possible to be so comfortable that you might take down your entire species? Yes.Am … am I a panda? If you are, I have to commend your ability to type so accurately with your great big paws.Do scientists want to make pandas less comfortable? To some extent, yes. The researchers have found that the ideal level of comfort to keep the pandas alive is 80%.Why 80%? Because then they are comfortable enough to thrive, but there’s still enough dissatisfaction to make them leave home, bump into a sexy panda stranger and get it on.Great! Job sorted. Well, that’s only step one. Even if two pandas were to clap eyes on each other and instantly fall in love, it doesn’t mean that we would hear the pitter patter of tiny paws any time soon. Remember the story of Tian Tian?Tian Tian? Yes, one of the UK’s only two giant pandas, leased to Edinburgh zoo a decade ago by the Bifengxia breeding centre in Sichuan, China. The lease runs out in December, and Tian Tian has failed to give birth.Why? Sometimes it just doesn’t happen. She had cubs in China, only to endure a number of failed pregnancies – some initiated by artificial insemination – in Edinburgh. Things went further downhill when her partner, Yang Guang, had his testicles removed, after a tumour was discovered.God, that’s sad. Is it? Or is she just so happy that she has rejected sex as a concept?There’s a moral here, isn’t there? Yes. It’s that it’s OK if personal contentment is more important to you than romantic love. And also that pandas are seemingly determined to make themselves extinct.Do say: “Happy pandas don’t have sex.”Don’t say: “Quick, someone invent Panda Instagram to make them all feel ugly and insecure.”",2021-03-12
 Shell chief vows to bolster emissions strategy after court ruling, Ben van Beurden pledges to ‘rise to challenge’ after court ordered oil firm to cut global carbon emissions by 45%,['Joanna Partridge'],"Royal Dutch Shell has vowed to accelerate its strategy towards becoming a net zero emissions business, two weeks after a Dutch court ruling ordered the company to cut its global carbon emissions by 45% by the end of 2030 compared with 2019 levels.Shell’s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, promised to “rise to the challenge” in helping to create a low-carbon energy system, but came out fighting for the Anglo-Dutch oil company he runs, insisting it has been leading the industry in taking responsibility for its carbon emissions.In a statement on his LinkedIn page, Van Beurden said he was surprised by the court’s verdict and was “disappointed that Shell is being singled out by a ruling that I believe does not help reduce global CO2 emissions”.He added: “A court ordering one energy company to reduce its emissions – and the emissions of its customers – is not the answer.”The transition to low-carbon energy, which remained necessary to battle the climate emergency, was “far too big a challenge for one company to tackle”, he wrote, calling for clearer regulations and policies from global governments.It’s time to nationalize Shell. Private oil companies are no longer fit for purpose | Johanna Bozuwa and Olúfẹ́mi O TáíwòRead moreShell said it was reviewing the ruling handed down last month by a court in The Hague and expected to appeal. But the court has said its decision is immediately applicable and should not be suspended before an appeal.Shell’s oil production had probably peaked in 2019, Van Beurden said, adding that he believed the firm’s total absolute carbon emissions would decline from 2018 levels. Instead, he said Shell should work with its customers to help them find their own way to achieving net zero emissions.The oil firm said it would continue to produce oil and gas products “for a long time to come” in order to meet customer demand and retain the company’s financial strength, while also attracting investment.“Imagine Shell decided to stop selling petrol and diesel today. This would certainly cut Shell’s carbon emissions. But it would not help the world one bit,” Van Beurden wrote. “Demand for fuel would not change. People would fill up their cars and delivery trucks at other service stations.”The company said it had “rigorous, short-term reduction targets” on the way to its goal of becoming a net zero emissions business by 2050. The chief executive added that Shell had taken responsibility for reducing the carbon emissions it produced, as well as those produced when customers used its products.The landmark Dutch case was brought by the environmental group Friends of the Earth and more than 17,000 co-plaintiffs, who successfully argued that Shell had been aware of the dangerous consequences of CO2 emissions for decades, and that and its targets remained insufficiently robust.The company was told by the court that its emission reductions, along with those of its suppliers and buyers, should be brought into line with the Paris climate agreement.Although it intended to appeal against the ruling, Shell said it would “seek ways to reduce emissions even further in a way that remains purposeful and profitable”.As part of its energy transition strategy, Shell said it had in recent years invested “billions of dollars” in lower-carbon energy, including wind and solar power, hydrogen and biofuels.Shell has vowed to give investors a chance to vote on the progress of its transition strategy at every annual shareholder meeting. Van Beurden complained that the court hearing took place several months before the publication of the strategy.Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk Shell faced a significant investor rebellion at its most recent AGM, when a shareholder resolution coordinated by Follow This, a Dutch climate activist group, calling for the company to set binding carbon emissions targets received 30% of votes.Mark van Baal, the founder of Follow This, said Van Beurden had “failed to have his epiphany moment, and still thinks that committing to the Paris agreement is an unfair ask. More stakeholders than ever are pushing for Paris-alignment and there comes a time when Shell will have to listen and act. Butvan Beurden can take comfort that Shell is not alone in this challenge.”Rachel Kennerley, an international climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said Shell’s promises did not far enough.She added: “If Mr van Beurden was as serious about this as he claims, he’d stop dismissing his company’s role in driving this devastating situation and would use the court ruling as an intervention to do the right thing, rather than appealing it with all of Shell’s corporate might.”",
Country Diary: Down on the floor with the solitary bees,"Holywell, Flintshire: In my attempts to make my garden more suitable for Mediterranean herbs, I created the conditions for these fascinating insects",['Jan Miller'],"I’m lying on my front on the moist, mossy lawn, the sun warming my back. Around me swallows are swooping in and out of the barn while dandelions, lady’s smock and cowslips attract the butterflies and bees. But down here, my attention is focused under the box hedges of my herb garden. I am watching volcanoes form. Not the sort that spew hot lava, but small cones of the gritty soil with a vent in the top about the size of my little fingernail.A tawny mining bee: ‘The 240 species of solitary bees in Britain … are just as important for pollination as the one species of honeybee.’ Photograph: Jan MillerThese are the entrances to the breeding burrows of the tawny mining bee, Andrena fulva. They are just one of the 240 species of solitary bees in Britain, and are just as important for pollination as the one species of honeybee. Each has different shaped mouthparts, which have evolved alongside flowers with different access routes to their nectar so that the plants are more likely to be pollinated from the same species. And you don’t have to farm the solitaries. This type needs only fine, sandy soil so they can dig deep burrows (and surprisingly quickly too with their tiny legs). They make side chambers and lay one egg in each, with a small supply of nectar and pollen. Then they’re sealed up and the larvae left to hibernate over winter, until they dig their way out the next spring.I could never grow Mediterranean herbs such as thyme, sage, oregano, orpine or lavender in my damp garden until a few years ago, when I had this square dug out and filled with limestone hardcore. Unwittingly, I had also made the perfect place for these mining bees to breed. It also helped that this was under the bit of lawn where we once had the kids’ sandpit.Meanwhile, the osmia mining bees – the red mason and the leafcutter bees you can buy nesting houses for in garden shops – are a different species. I was puzzled to see an osmia scrabbling against the mud-sealed doors once, as I thought it couldn’t be a predator of its own kind. A quick post on the Facebook page of the specialist Bees, Wasps and Ants Recording Society got me an answer in 10 minutes – it was the male who could “smell” the virgin female inside and was desperate to mate with her before any other.

"Monday briefing: The dramatic, agonising, crucial talks that will decide Cop27’s success","In today’s newsletter: For the next two weeks, ministers, negotiators from countries large and small will gather in Egypt. Can they get anything done?",['Archie Bland'],"Good morning. Last year, the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow kept alive the target of holding global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels; but, conference president Alok Sharma said, “its pulse is weak”. The vital question for the Cop27 summit at Sharm-el-Sheikh in Egypt, which began yesterday, is whether it will prove to be an emergency room or a hospice.If Cop27 is to have any chance of renewing global commitments after a year of extremely limited progress, the work of the negotiators who will take over once world leaders have departed at the end of today will be crucial. I spoke to the Guardian’s environment correspondent Fiona Harvey about the fascinating, byzantine, surprisingly dramatic and extremely nerdy process of climate diplomacy – and why, as deeply frustrating as it might be, it matters so much.That’s after the headlines. And a quick note to say that I’m off the rest of this week – Nimo and recurring guest star Dan Milmo will be in your inbox.Five big stories
Economy | Jeremy Hunt will announce £25bn worth of tax rises and £35bn in spending cuts at the autumn statement, the Guardian understands. The scale of the measures has grown significantly after the Bank of England’s dire forecasts last week of the longest recession since the 1930s.
Ukraine | The Biden administration has reportedly warned Kyiv that allies’ “Ukraine fatigue” could worsen if Volodymyr Zelenskiy continues to be closed to negotiations with Russia.
Climate crisis | An assessment by Carbon Brief has found the US, UK and Canada have fallen billions of dollars short of their “fair share” of climate funding for low-income countries. This comes after the UN’s World Meteorological Organization said the past eight years were the eight hottest ever recorded, putting the internationally agreed 1.5C limit for global heating “barely within reach”.
Politics | Rishi Sunak is facing further questions over his political judgment after it emerged he was made aware of a complaint against his political ally Gavin Williamson before appointing him. Sunak was said to have been unaware of the contents of hostlile texts sent to former chief whip Wendy Morton.
Housing | More than 138,000 properties in England and Wales are owned by offshore companies. In London the offshore holdings are worth as much as £55bn.
In depth: ‘It’s awful and frustrating – but you can’t solve the climate crisis without Cop’A worker prepares the entrance to the “Green Zone” ahead of Cop27. Photograph: Thomas Hartwell/APThere are “periods of intense activity and huge longueurs” at climate summits, says Fiona Harvey in Sharm-el-Sheikh; happily, I reach her during one of the longueurs.She emphasises that this is not a “decision summit” like Glasgow. Instead, the focus will be on holding countries accountable for their commitments last year against the backdrop of the global energy crisis brought about by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In this piece from May, UN climate adviser Rachel Kyte describes the task as “implementation, implementation, implementation”.“We won’t get an agreement or a new treaty at the end of it,” Fiona said. “But it’s incredibly important we see progress.” This piece explains why it’s looking so tough, while this one sets out the vital importance of “loss and damage” financing for developing nations – which was finally confirmed as part of the agenda for the talks after “fractious” discussions that dragged late into the night and delayed the opening of the conference proper.In the Guardian’s Down to Earth newsletter (sign up here for twice-weekly updates throughout Cop27), Fiona writes: “This year’s Cop will be arguably the hardest yet.” The only path to success is through the endless minutiae of negotiation – “a lot of horrible absurdity”, Fiona said. “People arguing in rooms for hours.” Here’s how it works.What is the framework for the summit?“The first two days are about world leaders being there and having their photos taken and talking,” Fiona said. “After that, the negotiators get on with it. In the second week, next Tuesday, we get the ‘high-level segment’ – that’s when ministers join the talks.”All Cop summits take place under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, a treaty agreed almost 30 years ago. Everything that happens in Sharm-el-Sheikh – “the fact of the meeting, setting the agenda, the texts agreed at the end of it” – is a product of the UNFCCC.“It was a massive achievement,” Fiona said. “It is full of frustrations, but you can’t redraw it now – you just wouldn’t get people to sign up to it. The important thing is that it means that once things are agreed, countries have a legal obligation to see them through.”Who are the negotiators?Countries are represented individually, but blocs of nations with common interests – like the Africa Group, the Least Developed Countries, and the Small Island Developing States – seek to increase their negotiating power by clubbing together.“The big countries have teams of negotiators who do nothing all year round but these talks,” Fiona said. “They will have someone in every workstream, in every room. The poorer ones can’t do that – they will send one country to one event, another to another, and compare notes.”For a sense of what it’s like negotiating on behalf of those most vulnerable to the impact of the climate crisis, see this riveting fly-on-the-wall account of the work of Giza Gaspar-Martins, chair of the Least Developed Countries group at the Paris summit in 2015. He dashes from meeting to meeting across the impractically vast site, pausing only to “talk to my wife” (smoke a cigarette) and “do the things I cannot delegate” (go to the loo).What do they negotiate over?“It’s hilarious on one level, awful on another,” Fiona said. “It just sounds incomprehensible to anyone outside of this bizarre bubble. There are non-papers, ‘informal informals’, acres of square brackets, rows about the placements of semicolons. They sit for hours hammering it all out.”But these arcane points really matter. As Giza Gaspar-Martins says of a draft of the final Paris agreement: “We need to do some detective work. Some good brains have been working hard to hide things in here.”Also in Paris, a last-minute row over whether a “shall” ought to have been a “should” was only resolved with the dubious claim that a “typographical error” had been made, allowing the US to overlook a stronger commitment than it wanted on mitigation efforts in the final text. (Here’s a terrific account of that drama by the Guardian’s then-environment editor John Vidal.)In Glasgow, Alok Sharma fought back tears as he apologised to delegates over a late change, forced by China and India, changed a commitment to “phase out” coal to the looser promise to “phase down” its use. “Did I appreciate we had to adjust one thing tonight in a very unusual way?” John Kerry said afterwards. “No. But if we hadn’t done that, we wouldn’t have a deal.”How do these agreements get reached?The country holding the presidency – Egypt this year – will assign countries responsibility for managing negotiations over particular areas. “There’s an ‘ad hoc working group’ for every key part of the process that will meet in their own little rooms,” Fiona said. “So the Cop president will say on climate finance, for example, let’s have one developed and one developing country go away and convene other countries for talks.”Also helpful, Fiona added, is the way the summit allows for accidental interactions of key players. “This is the only forum which puts the developing countries on a somewhat level playing field,” she said. “They can catch a minister from an EU nation in a corridor, and say, with moral authority, ‘come on, mate’. That’s important.”None of this is very glamorous. Pictures abound from previous Cops of windowless shoeboxes with uncomfortable looking chairs shoehorned around a table covered in cold pizza and heavily annotated drafts. But it’s necessary work ahead of the final stage of discussions in the plenary session, which all countries attend.How does the text get finally agreed?One criticism of the consensus model of the Cop summits – which sees the text agreed in a final session involving every country – is that it enforces the “will of the laggards”: the argument is that is easy for countries that are reluctant to adopt crucial climate change measures to put a spanner in the works.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Saudi Arabia and Russia are happy to be the people in closed rooms making criticisms, but they don’t want to put themselves out there like that. So the process of consensus can force the laggards to catch up, and it outs those who won’t agree.”She points to the example of Durban 2011, where the treaty that became the Paris agreement was born. “Everyone was on board except China and India, and the EU forced a showdown – the talks went on for days, and in the end the EU called out China and India, and said, are you going to stand up? And they didn’t.”Does all of this add up to a process that meets the vast crisis already under way? Hardly. “You sit there and you talk about five-year review processes – we haven’t got five bloody years,” Fiona said. “But while Cop won’t solve the climate crisis, you can’t solve the climate crisis without Cop. It’s awful and inadequate and frustrating, but it’s still essential. These discussions are incredibly important because they’re the only discussions we’ve got.”What else we’ve been reading

  Egg prices could rise for UK consumers as farmers cut flock numbers,Fewer laying birds are being placed on farms as producers respond to poor retail profit margins,"['Supported by', 'About this content', 'Tom Levitt']","Consumers could be hit with higher egg prices as UK farmers reduce their flock numbers, in response to escalating costs and insufficient profit margins.The numbers of chicks being placed by egg producers in April was down 15% year on year, according to the latest government  figures.Egg farmers have been warning for months that a “tidal wave” of rising costs in feed, energy, labour and packaging was not being reflected in retail prices.They have criticised supermarkets for ignoring industry warnings, with a leading producer telling delegates at the British Pig and Poultry Fair last week he expected a shortage of eggs later this year given the cuts in chick placings.The government data, published on Thursday, confirms a decline in producers restocking their flocks with new birds. The number of eggs being set by hatcheries fell even further in April, down 35% on the previous year.The number of chicks being placed by egg producers indicates the number of eggs that will be available to consumers in the months ahead.Hen eggs take about 21 days to hatch, but chicks do not start laying until they are aged about 20 weeks. Any reduction in chicks now will not affect the availability of eggs until the autumn.The existing hens on farms will continue producing eggs until they are 70 to 80 weeks old, but the overall flock population will fall as hens are not replaced.Free-range eggs unavailable in Britain from MondayRead more“It’s showing what we were predicting, that there will be a shortage unless retailers respond by raising prices,” said Robert Gooch, chief executive of the British FreeRange Egg Producers Association.Gooch says producers need a 3p per egg price increase to forestall a much bigger price rise when supplies fall later this year. Retail egg prices in May were up by about 8%, or 15p, per half dozen from last year, according to Trolley.co.uk, a supermarket price tracker.“If you were making money you wouldn’t do it [not restock]. You only do it because you can’t make a profit. It’s a crisis for producers and it will translate into a crisis for consumers later this year,” said Gooch.Andrew Opie, from the British Retail Consortium, said supermarkets sourced most of their food from the UK and “know they need to pay a sustainable price to farmers to ensure British eggs remain on the shelves”.A spokesperson for the British Egg Industry Council said chick placements did historically rise and fall depending on factors such as how long producers decide to keep their existing hens before replacing them. “However, with the current cost crisis, some producers are choosing not to repopulate their houses.” A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “We recognise the challenges faced by the egg industry, including the ongoing impact of Avian Influenza and increased input costs – and are continuing to monitor the situation, working closely with stakeholders.” Sign up for the Animals Farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the biggest farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

" Here in British Columbia, we have spent the summer running from cruel wildfires Mary Stockdale",Blazes are destroying whole communities. The Canadian government must act now to tackle this existential threat,,"Small fires crackle into life on the hills around us at the slightest provocation. Creeks swell with flash floods, as upland snow melts at record speed. Our town’s beloved colony of great blue herons fall stunned out of the trees in their dozens. Animals, from cougars to rattlesnakes, leave their hidden places to seek water. The temperature has risen, and stalled, at a nearly unbearable 45C.This is what a heat dome feels like in Vernon, a community in the British Columbian interior in Canada.It’s been quite the summer in British Columbia (BC), where a brutal heatwave has given way to wildfires. At 49.6C, the village of Lytton set a hotter record than there’s ever been in Las Vegas. The fires have burned nearly 8,582 sq km of forest since the spring and caused evacuation orders to be issued across the province. Lytton and another nearby community, Monte Lake, have been destroyed by the vengeful climate.Our fire, here in Vernon, announced itself with a wave of thick smoke and a glowing red horizon that made us think of JRR Tolkien’s Mordor. At midnight, an evacuation order was issued for the west side of the Okanagan Lake, where members of the Okanagan Indian Band live among enclaves of retirees, ranchers and back-to-the-landers. Soon after, two exhausted evacuees arrived at our door with their dogs, cats and belongings; they are friends of ours, to whom we had promised refuge.As the fire grew across the lake over the next few days, we found ourselves talking with hushed voices. Unable to ignore the red glare on the horizon, we felt awestruck by the ash floating from the sky, covering our decks, outdoor tables and car windshields. We shared photos of the piles of burnt forest debris, mainly small black twigs and needles, that had washed ashore on the lake’s beaches. We spoke obsessively of the air quality index, which I estimated had reached 45 times the World Health Organization exposure recommendation, ranking it as one of the worst on the planet.Mary Stockdale’s son, pictured far right, with other firefighters near Vernon, British Columbia. Photograph: Justin RobertsonSometimes it was not ash, but still-glowing embers that floated over to our side of the lake. Although the water provided a natural barrier to the front of the fire, it was being breached by these small missiles, and all of us had to look lively for any fires that started up under these tinder-dry conditions.As the situation worsened, an evacuation alert for Vernon was announced, stirring us all into action. My husband and I started packing. What do we need to live on? What don’t we want to lose to the fire? My mother was trying to do the same next door, but she was hampered by my bewildered father who has dementia. My daughter ran over to help.Eventually, we assembled a convoy of vehicles, packed to the brim and ready to move our three-generation family, our twice-evacuated friends and our assortment of pets. We worried about what it would be like if the people of greater Vernon got the order to evacuate, and all 66,000 of us tried to move out at once.Later that day, the cultural centre across the street decided to go ahead with its live outdoor concert. Like passengers on the Titanic, we sat on our ashy front steps and listened to the music. To our delight, the first rainstorm in weeks blew in to rescue us, and we jumped up to dance in the raindrops, accompanied by the happy whoops of the musicians over the loudspeakers.As a result of the rain, the evacuation alert was rescinded, at least for most of Vernon. However, the west side remained evacuated, with dozens of homes burned to the ground. I joined many other community members in volunteering to help with the registration of several thousand evacuees and their referral to emergency services.It’s good that the BC government looks after people’s basic needs: shelter, food, clothing, incidentals, but this doesn’t alleviate their misery. These were emotionally exhausted people: an elderly woman who longed for her home and garden; a man who had put his back out with the effort of moving house; a family who, in rescuing their grandmother with her oxygen tank, were forced to jettison most of their belongings. Saddest of all was a young family who broke down telling us about the mother dog with puppies that they had to abandon to the flames when fleeing the fire.In the cadet barracks on the south side of town, 250 soldiers were brought in to help us, and a camp was set up on the north side for 330 firefighters. A small group of locals have gathered at a spot on the highway to cheer them home each evening.How can Britain be committed to net zero when it’s about to drill for millions more barrels of oil? | Greg MuttittRead moreMy son, a 21-year-old firefighter, called. Since he was new to this, we had hoped they would put him to work digging ditches, but he was sent straight to the front, where he said it was like a war zone: helicopters buzzing, smoke thick, trees suddenly candling.My brother called. A fire researcher, he’s been making predictive models from satellite imagery for the firefighters. He was feeling anxious for us, as he could see that a second heatwave was on its way, to be followed by gusting winds that might stir up our fire again.Once again, we have been thrust into a period of uncertainty. What will happen to us and to other endangered communities to the north and east of our fire?A federal election has just been called in Canada. We desperately hope our region’s voters, given all that we have gone through, will send a strong protest vote to Ottawa, saying they must take the climate crisis seriously.

 This article is more than 5 months oldSunak’s plan for carbon capture is good news: he shouldn’t muddy it with party politicsThis article is more than 5 months oldSimon Jenkins,Consensus on tackling the climate crisis is what’s needed now – and direct action against CO2 must be the next move,,"For as long as the United Kingdom needs to use oil and gas, we should be making an effort to capture any resulting CO2 and store it. That clearly makes sense. It also makes sense to produce our own oil and gas, so we are less beholden to exporters (though of course ours, too, would be sold on the international markets).So far, so good for Rishi Sunak’s twofold announcement today in Scotland. But it would be helpful if he did not muddy these waters by using them to score political points against Labour in the run-up to an election campaign. What we desperately need now, as we confront the climate crisis, is agreement on a way forward. Bringing party politics into it will only hinder progress.Of course, critics are right to say that where we buy our energy should not deflect attention from the urgent need to reduce demand for fossil fuels. But that issue is one of constraining overall demand, not arguing over the source of supply. Preferring to use only ship-borne oil to avoid the supposed taint of dirtying our hands in the North Sea would be hypocrisy.Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a separate issue. Like power from nuclear fusion, it is one of those solutions to the climate crisis that has always been just over the horizon. But as academics such as Oxford’s Myles Allen and Edinburgh’s Stuart Haszeldine have long argued, unlike fusion, the issue is not one of science and technology. It is one of politics and money. Norway’s carbon capture operations in the North Sea have been running since 1996, and now store close to a million tonnes of CO2 every year. Denmark’s first full-scale carbon capture and storage project was launched this summer, also in the North Sea. There is nothing new in Sunak’s project other than it is British.Rishi Sunak says approving new licences for oil and gas drilling ‘entirely consistent’ with net zero plan – UK politics liveRead moreThis issue now is one of politics. Existing CCS currently reduces CO2 emissions by 0.1%. To meet net zero, it needs to rise to 10%. This requires a massive uplift of investment. At present, Sunak’s commitment to the current Acorn project appears to be minimal, particularly in comparison to the reportedly “unachievable” and energy-guzzling HS2. But CCS has one advantage: that it could be largely financed through the marketplace by imposing the cost not on taxpayers, but on polluters direct. According to Haszeldine, all emitters of CO2 should themselves fund the capture and storage of one tonne of the gas for every tonne they emit. He estimates this would add probably 15p a litre to the price of petrol. Everyone – producers and consumers – would play their part.It is known in the energy world that the big corporations are waiting to be ordered to embark on CCS by a government with the guts to do it. That is perhaps why they have been building up cash reserves to obscene levels. It has to be right that those who produce pollutants should also dispose of them. There is no pretending that this will be cheap. But efforts to reduce global emissions piecemeal are reportedly failing even to approach net zero. There are clearly limits to how far the rich world will transform its lifestyle. The next great battle has to be direct action against CO2. That this would cost money can hardly be an objection: this is a crisis, after all.

" This article is more than 11 months oldFood, feed and fuel: global seaweed industry could reduce land needed for farming by 110m hectares, study findsThis article is more than 11 months old",Scientists identify parts of ocean suitable for seaweed cultivation and suggest it could constitute 10% of human diet to reduce impact of agriculture,"['Graham Readfearn', '@readfearn']","An area of ocean almost the size of Australia could support commercial seaweed farming around the world, providing food for humans, feed supplements for cattle, and alternative fuels, according to new research.Seaweed farming is a nascent industry globally but the research says if it could grow to constitute 10% of human diets by 2050 it could reduce the amount of land needed for food by 110m hectares (272m acres) – an area twice the size of France.But the authors of the research said there are a range of potential negative impacts on marine life that will need to be balanced with the benefits of a global seaweed farming industry.The study looked at 34 seaweed species and where they could feasibly grow and then narrowed this down to places with calm enough waters and close enough to populations where farms could be established.Have we reached ‘peak meat’? Why one country is trying to limit its number of livestockRead moreAbout 650m hectares (1,606m acres) was identified as plausible for seaweed farming, with the largest areas in Indonesia and Australia which both have large ocean regions under their economic control.“Cultivating seaweeds for food, feed and fuel within even a fraction of the 650m hectares of suitable ocean could have profound benefits to land use, emissions reduction, water and fertiliser use,” the authors wrote.Scott Spillias, a researcher at the University of Queensland in Australia who led the study published in Nature Sustainability, said: “People around the world are looking at the ocean as this big ‘untapped’ resource and asking if we should be using more of it.”One of the biggest benefits, the study said, would be the cultivation and use of red Asparagopsis as a cattle feed supplement that has been shown to result in drastically lower methane emissions from cows. One supplement based on the seaweed reportedly went on commercial sale to farmers in Australia last year.The study suggested cuts to methane emissions from using Asparagopsis could save 2.6bn tonnes of CO2-equivalent a year by 2050 – about the same as the current greenhouse gas footprint of India.Spillias said introducing more seaweed into human diets could also deliver benefits. In parts of Asia, seaweed makes up 2% of diets, but scaling this up to 10% globally could spare 110m hectares of land currently used for growing food.“Basically this is just people eating more vegetables,” he said. “If we grow seaweed, the best thing to do is for people to eat it rather than feed it to livestock, but that’s going to need some big cultural shifts.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If this is done on a large scale we need to find better materials.”He said if there was a widescale push globally for seaweed farming, there could be social implications.“Marine industries do not have a great reputation on human rights and if we’re farming seaweed largely out of sight, then we need to think of the people in these industries and make sure they’re being fairly treated,” he said.",2023-01-27
" This article is more than 4 months oldUS behind more than a third of global oil and gas expansion plans, report findsThis article is more than 4 months old",Study highlights conflict between Washington’s claims of climate leadership and its fossil fuel growth plans,"['Fiona Harvey', ' Environment editor']","The US accounts for more than a third of the expansion of global oil and gas production planned by mid-century, despite its claims of climate leadership, research has found.Canada and Russia have the next biggest expansion plans, calculated based on how much carbon dioxide is likely to be produced from new developments, followed by Iran, China and Brazil. The United Arab Emirates, which is to host the annual UN climate summit this year, Cop28 in Dubai in November, is seventh on the list.The data, in a report from the campaign group Oil Change International, also showed that five “global north countries” – the US, Canada, Australia, Norway and the UK – will be responsible for just over half of all the planned expansion from new oil and gas fields to 2050.Greenhouse gas emissions from all of the oil and gas expansion that is planned in the next three decades would be more than enough to drive global temperatures well beyond the limit of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels that countries agreed in 2021 at Cop26 in Glasgow, the report found.The International Energy Agency warned in 2021 that no new oil and gas exploration and development could take place if the world was to stay within the 1.5C limit. But only a handful of countries with oil and gas reserves are forswearing new exploration and drilling.Romain Ioualalen, the global policy lead at Oil Change International and co-author of the report, said countries must call a halt to fossil fuel expansion. “It’s simple: when you are in a hole, the first step is to stop digging,” he said. “The climate crisis is global in nature, but is atrociously unjust. A handful of the world’s richest nations are risking our future by willingly ignoring the calls to rapidly phase out fossil fuels.”The report, titled Planet wreckers: how 20 countries’ oil and gas extraction plans risk locking in climate chaos, published on Tuesday, found that 20 countries were responsible for plans for new oil and gas developments by 2050 that would add about 173bn tonnes of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. That amount is the same as the lifetime emissions of 1,100 coal-fired power plants, or more than 30 years of the US’s annual emissions.By contrast, if countries were to forego bringing new oil and gas fields into production, the decline of existing fields would mean global oil and gas production would slow by about 2% a year from now to 2030, and 5% a year from 2030 to 2050.The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has stepped up calls for countries to get out of fossil fuels, warning of “moral and economic madness”, and has said fossil fuel interests have “humanity by the throat”. He will convene a conference of world leaders later this month in New York to try to elicit fresh commitments to tackle the climate crisis.He has told world leaders they will be allowed to participate in the summit, on the sidelines of the annual UN general assembly, only if they can show that they have clear implementation plans to cut their greenhouse gas emissions.The Guardian revealed at the weekend that Rishi Sunak, the UK prime minister, had been warned of the UN’s strict policy on whether leaders could participate before he took the highly unusual decision not to attend the UN general assembly.Sunak promised over the summer to “max out” the UK’s oil and gas operations in the North Sea, with scores of potential new licences.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We know we cannot keep opening up new oil and gas fields if we want a habitable world, yet that is exactly what this government is doing.”She added: “Rishi Sunak needs to stop bowing to the demands of the fossil fuel companies, who continue to rake in obscene profits while millions of us cannot afford to heat our homes.”A spokesperson for the UK’s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: “This report ignores the great strides we have taken in reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. Between 1990 and 2021, we cut emissions by 48% while growing our economy by 65% – decarbonising faster than any other G7 country.“Even in 2050, when we have reached net zero, it is estimated the UK may still be using a quarter of the gas we do now and, as well as strengthening our energy security, independent research has shown domestically produced gas is on average four times cleaner than imports.”",2023-09-12
"The Guardian view on switching off: in an always-on culture, we need time to thinkEditorial",Midwinter is for hibernation and the chance to make different kinds of connections,,"“Disconnect from the internet for at least two hours a day and treat your own thoughts like a garden through which you are strolling,” was the advice offered by the novelist Ian McEwan to younger writers after being made a Companion of Honour in December. The capacity to be curious about mental processes – while simultaneously experiencing them – is an important one for an author seeking to describe the human condition. But anyone who values self-awareness will be used to noticing how their mind works and wondering why.“Only connect” was the maxim of another famous novelist, EM Forster. Forster used the characters in his novels to put flesh on his arguments against the emotionally repressive code of the time. But McEwan’s recommendation to disconnect should not be understood as a repudiation of Forster’s humanism. He was not warning writers off paying attention to other people’s minds and ideas – but drawing attention to the need to spend time with our own. In a world of permanent connection, in which attention has been commodified, switching off and away from the outside world is arguably harder than ever before.Many of us are so attached to our phones and other devices that even a temporary separation provokes anxiety (though less so for those whose jobs are not screen-based, and whose communications are arguably better balanced as a result). The Guardian’s new series Reclaim Your Brain is a response to the growing frustration that many feel at the hold that smartphones have on our minds and happiness, and explores ways of resetting that relationship.But tuning out, whether for two hours or two weeks, is not only about defying the masters of the digital universe – or turning back the clock to a time before news was 24/7 and phones were video cameras. What is turned towards also counts. The long evenings of January, with a new year stretching ahead of us, can be a good time for introspection as well as the self-improvement that traditionally takes the form of resolutions such as diets and exercise plans.John Keats set out his theory of “negative capability” in a letter written in the middle of winter, after an evening walk with a friend. We cannot say whether the shortness of the day inspired the direction that the poet’s thoughts took that evening in 1817. But the state of not knowing that Keats believed artists should aspire to – the ability to be “in uncertainties, Mysteries and doubts without any irritable reaching after fact or reason” – seems more fitted to gloomy candlelight than blazing sunshine.Doing nothing can be boring. Being alone can be miserable. Far too many people in the UK this winter are experiencing severe material or social deprivation. To those whose lives are otherwise full – of activities, appointments, responsibilities, pleasures – a few weeks’ hibernation may be welcome. For many others, it is a more stimulating life, rather than a quieter, more secluded one, that is desired.But for others, this time of year is valuable for the sense of slowing down it brings; the chance to take stock either on one’s own or through talking with others. Looking ahead is one aspect of this. Another is looking back and inward; or not looking at all, but being in the moment with our hopes, mysteries and doubts.",2024-01-06
 Britain arrives at Cop27 in disarray over the climate – and the world’s leaders know itLucy Sherriff,"After Johnson’s weak energy plan and Truss’s scepticism, we have Rishi Sunak, who didn’t even want to attend",,"“Unless we take urgent action, we will get 3C hotter,” Boris Johnson told the UN climate talks in 2020. “As a country … we must now act.” The former prime minister’s words were a rallying cry to galvanise the government into taking action on global heating.Johnson’s administration had been under heavy fire for its lacklustre approach to the climate crisis. But fast forward a year to Cop26, and not much had changed. Johnson’s appearance was criticised as much as his policies; he was described as “a clown” after comparing the climate emergency to James Bond wrestling with a ticking bomb. His comments were in keeping with the travelling circus act that he has been performing ever since he first entered politics – even the future of the world was a joke.The government’s target of net zero emissions by 2050 and its plan to phase out petrol-powered vehicles by 2035 were certainly a steer in the right direction. But Johnson’s pledges – and his words – proved meaningless.Long before he was ousted as Conservative leader, his energy security strategy fell flat; originally promised for March this year, it was delayed by weeks. The final product failed to deliver on the government’s original promises to confront rocketing energy bills and transition away from fossil fuels. Instead, Johnson promised investment in offshore windfarms and new nuclear plants, the benefits of which won’t be felt for years.In September, the UK missed its deadline to pay nearly $300m to the developing countries hit hardest by the climate crisis, from Honduras to Afghanistan to Ethiopia. The money was pledged at Cop26, where poorer nations, gripped by floods, droughts and rising sea levels, had called for $100bn of financial aid. The global south has been plagued by climate-induced disasters, the likes of which the western world has yet to experience. India, for example, has witnessed a climate-induced disaster almost every day so far this year.00:04:00Cop27: the climate carnage we've faced this year – videoBut it is these beleaguered countries that have been urged to halt their industrial development and switch to greener means in order to curb climate change, despite western powers’ prolific use of fossil fuels. After years of lecturing India, China, Indonesia and other members of the developing world about coal dependence, the UK – and Europe – is now turning to coal-powered generation to see it through the impending energy crisis caused by the Ukraine-Russia war. A blistering, shameful irony that only betrays how ill-prepared we really are for a clean energy future. And to add insult to injury, the government recently offered new licences to drill in the North Sea.The UK’s dire lack of action on the impending climate catastrophe has been compounded by a revolving door of prime ministers. Many breathed a sigh of relief when Liz Truss – who expressed scepticism about the ambitious action needed to meet net zero goals, wanted to suspend green levies and moved to overturn a ban on fracking, among various other climate faux pas – handed in her notice.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But Rishi Sunak’s initial decision not to attend this year’s talks because he was too focused on the domestic economy exposed exactly where the new government’s priorities lie. An insular approach to climate change is absolutely the wrong one. Turning inwards and focusing on self-interests is what got us here in the first place.Sadly, Sunak’s U-turn comes too late. We have already glimpsed behind the veil, along with the rest of the world. “It seems as if they are washing their hands of leadership,” remarked Belize’s ambassador to the UN, Carlos Fuller.The world will not forget the prime minister so publicly prioritising his home turf over the world’s most pressing issues. What the UK needs – what the world needs – is to turn ambition into action, and to pursue a global approach to tackling the crisis.It is now abundantly clear that we are not going to meet the 1.5C target for global heating agreed by western leaders with such conviction at the historic Paris climate talks in 2015.

","['Mostafa Rachwani', '@Rachwani91']","Taronga and Melbourne zoos have introduced measures to protect their animals from the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak that is threatening Australia.Although there have been no domestic cases reported yet, both zoos have implemented added biosecurity restrictions as precautionary measures amid the outbreak in Indonesia.The Taronga Conservation Society Australia, which runs Taronga Zoo and the Western Plains Zoo in Dubbo, said they have stopped allowing visitors to walk through the enclosures of animals which are at higher risk of exposure and visitors are wearing footwear covers in some areas.They said they are also reviewing their FMD plan to ensure it is aligned with the plan established by Ausvet, the national body for animal epidemiologists.“Across our two zoos Taronga has enacted stricter measures including the cessation of animal walkthroughs with animals at higher risk such as the deer and goat walkthroughs at Taronga Western Plains Zoo,” the Taronga Conservation Society said in a statement.“The wearing of footwear covers in some animal encounters will also be implemented. We are currently in the process of communicating this with our community.”Zoos Victoria said the risk of transmission to their animals was extremely low, but in an email to members they announced a series of protocol changes.People who have recently visited Indonesia are being asked to wait 48 hours before visiting the zoo, while those who live with any livestock – except horses – have been requested to avoid visiting altogether.

A public pathway along a trail used by critically endangered Asian elephants to walk between paddocks has been blocked off to ensure the animals are not stepping in soil that could have been brought in from outside the zoo.Additionally, visitor encounters with giraffes, kangaroos, and elephants are temporarily unavailable.Foot-and-mouth disease: ‘biosecurity response zones’ set up at airports in Australian firstRead more“We have put in place some containment protocols to help ensure our animals are safe and that this risk remains low,” the email to zoo members said.Zoos Victoria said staff are also taking precautions to ensure animals are protected, and will be following the Department of Agriculture and Chief Veterinary Officer’s advice in the event of an outbreak.The federal opposition has intensified its calls to shut the border with Indonesia, but agriculture minister Murray Watt said such a move would damage Australia’s agricultural reputation, especially as evidence suggests existing biosecurity measures are doing their job.On Monday, opposition leader Peter Dutton said the government was “playing with a loaded gun”, suggesting that if the virus were to reach Australia, hundreds of thousands of livestock would be slaughtered, forcing the price of meat “through the roof.”There have been no detections of the live virus in Australia, but viral fragments have been detected. Biosecurity response zones were set up Australian airports last week.The government has also ordered the checking of parcels arriving from China and Indonesia as part of the response to the virus.While the disease is not dangerous to humans, if an outbreak were to occur, a 72-hour stand still for all livestock movements in Australia would have to be implemented, amid a significant biosecurity containment response.",2022-07-26
Are debt-for-nature swaps the way forward for conservation?,Agreements to reduce developing countries’ debt burden in exchange for spending on nature will be on the agenda at a finance summit in Paris this week,"['The age of extinction is supported by', 'About this content', 'Patrick Greenfield', '@pgreenfielduk']","After decades in the wilderness, and familiar to only those in the know, “debt-for-nature swaps” are becoming one of the hottest things in conservation finance. Last month, Ecuador struck the biggest deal of its kind: refinancing $1.6bn (£1.3bn) of its commercial debt at a discount in exchange for a consistent revenue stream for conservation around the Galápagos Islands.Other nature-rich countries that are struggling to pay their debts have taken notice and deals are rumoured in Gabon and Sri Lanka. The market for debt-for-nature swaps is poised to exceed $800bn, according to Bloomberg, prompting fierce competition between banks as demand for green investments increases.The ‘father of biodiversity’ Dr Thomas Lovejoy, in 2005. He had the original idea behind debt-for-nature swaps. Photograph: Dallas Kilponen/SMH/Getty ImagesDebt-for-nature swaps mean reducing a developing country’s debt burden in exchange for guaranteed finance for nature. Supporters of the concept – which has its roots in the 1980s debt crisis and an idea from the late “father of biodiversity”, Thomas Lovejoy – say it is a win-win for financiers, countries and conservationists.This week, the subject will be on the agenda at the Summit for a New Global Financing Pact in Paris, spearheaded by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the prime minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley. Barbados entered into its own $150m debt-for-nature deal in 2021.“The world is facing a biodiversity, climate and debt crisis, which is even more pronounced in the developing world,” says Slav Gatchev, managing director of sustainable debt for the Nature Conservancy (TNC), which is often involved in facilitating deals.“There is an overlap between biodiversity hotspots in the tropics and excessive levels of debt,” he says. “Typically, countries approach us because they’ve seen that these deals can be done at scale.As debtor nations cut back on government spending, programmes for protecting natural resources are among the first to goThomas Lovejoy“You can move the needle in terms of financial pinch points, resolving liquidity constraints before they become solvency problems and, because of our role as a conservation organisation, we can be an honest broker when it comes to implementing these programmes on the ground.”But detractors of the deals warn of greenwashing, and have criticised agreements in which banks often take large fees with comparatively small amounts going to conservation.In a note to investors in January, Barclays questioned the green credentials of debt-for-nature swaps – often sold as ESG (environmental, social and governance) investments – because only a small fraction of the deal size ends up with conservation. This claim is strongly disputed by the banks involved.Separately, Daniel Ortega Pacheco, a former Ecuadorian environment minister, is concerned about the potential implications of the agreements for sovereignty. Last month’s Galápagos agreement requires Ecuador to provide about $18m a year to conserve waters near the islands, mostly for a new Hermandad marine reserve that hosts whale sharks, blue whales and leatherback turtles.“When you take a closer look at nature-for-debt swaps, Moody’s actually says they count as a default. [A deal] might prejudice developing countries in the long term and there are restrictions on how the money can be spent. Even after the second world war, Germany was free to decide where to invest,” he says.The concerns are echoed by Katie Kedward, a UCL research fellow, who says the agreements do not go far enough. “The pandemic has brought debt restructuring back into the conversation. In terms of sovereign debt burdens, those constraints are preventing countries from investing in conservation and adaptation to the increased risks of climate change.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Global DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Minden Pictures/Alamy“I would argue that we need to go further and look at debt forgiveness. I am hugely sceptical about how debt-for-nature swaps are being implemented in practice,” she says.Gatchev says these concerns are unfounded, pointing to case studies by TNC of deals in Belize and Barbados, which he says show that the benefit accrues to the countries. The deals are specific to the requirements of each country and try to anticipate potential problems. The Belize agreement includes natural disaster insurance, intended to avoid the scenario where the country is forced to pay for conservation instead of rebuilding after a hurricane.The reasons for entering the agreements bear striking parallels to the arguments of Lovejoy in 1984, when the idea was first developed.Experts call for ‘loss and damage’ fund for nature in developing worldRead more“As debtor nations cut back on government spending, programmes for protecting natural resources are among the first to go,” Lovejoy wrote in the New York Times at the time. “Costa Rica’s superb national park system cannot be staffed or enlarged without private donations from outside the country.“Brazil’s equivalent of the Environmental Protection Agency can do little more than pay the salaries of its employees; when fires recently broke out in its national park system, there were few guards around to fight them,” he said.In Paris, Mia Mottley’s Bridgetown agenda will attempt to reform global finance for the environmental crises of the modern age.

 Climate protesters gather in person and online for Fridays for Future,"Campaigners target Standard Chartered, urging bank to stop funding coal in emerging markets","['Robyn Vinter', '@robynvinter']","Climate protesters from as many as 60 countries have gathered in person and online for Fridays for Future, a movement created by the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg.Campaigners raised local issues alongside the globally co-ordinated campaign #cleanupStandardChartered, which calls on the London-headquartered Standard Chartered to divest from coal in emerging markets.Activist dives for global climate strike in first underwater protest for the planet – videoThe action follows a letter activists wrote last month to the Standard Chartered chief executive, Bill Winters, calling for the FTSE100 bank to stop funding coal.It said: “Standard Chartered is still one of the world’s largest coal-financing banks, fuelling the climate crisis.“Mr Winters, funding destruction, killing the planet, and contributing to the death of its inhabitants must stop.”Thunberg also tweeted a link to the campaign, claiming the bank had lent $24bn to coal, oil, and gas businesses since the Paris agreement on climate was signed in 2016.In the Philippines, where Standard Chartered is the biggest funder of the coal industry, activists stood outside the bank’s headquarters with banners and placards.Maths graduate and full-time activist Mitzi Jonelle Tan was part of a group that handed over a giant cheque to symbolise the amount of money the bank had lent to the coal industry in the country, which they said was $674m.She said: “Put simply, we need immediate action because the climate crisis is here and it’s only going to get worse. And we need to choose the people and the planet over profits.“That’s all we’re asking for that we listen to the science that we prioritise people because this is a matter of life and death. The climate crisis is already here.”In the UK, student activist Dominique Palmer was part of a group that protested outside the University of Birmingham and Birmingham city council calling for divestment from fossil fuels. She also took part in online activism as part of the #cleanupStandardChartered campaign, using social platforms to boost the voices of people in other parts of the world who are more directly affected by the climate crisis.Activist on hunger strike in Canada calls on government to halt loggingRead morePalmer said: “It’s so important that on this side of the world we’re also getting involved in helping pressure, and you know also helping platform, the voices of people who have already been directly impacted by it, so that’s why we’re taking action over here.”Climate activists are increasingly targeting banks. Environmental campaigners put Barclays and HSBC under pressure last year and both banks have agreed to discuss divesting from fossil fuels.A Standard Chartered spokesperson said: “We have made major strides in our coal policy over the past few years. We continue to review our positions in light of stakeholder feedback and intend to remain leaders in articulating a path to net zero by 2050. We are committed to detailed transparency on our transition strategy and plan to put it to a shareholder advisory vote in 2022.“Our position regarding coal is that we will not provide financial services directly toward new coal-fired power plant projects in any location. We will not provide financial services directly toward any coal-fired power plant expansions, retrofits or dedicated infrastructure.”",2018-03-09
 There's a simple way to make our cities greener – without a wrecking ballPhineas Harper,Architecture’s top prize has been awarded to a design duo who could show Britain how to bring its emissions under control,,"This week the highest honour in the architecture world was awarded to a pair of Parisian designers better known for revitalising existing buildings than creating new ones. The Pritzker prize, which includes a $100,000 jackpot, went to Anne Lacaton and Jean-Philippe Vassal, whose most impressive projects – the Palais de Tokyo in Paris, upgrading three social housing blocks in Bordeaux, and the extension of a Dunkirk warehouse to form an arts complex – are all refurbishments.It’s the first time in the award’s 46-year history that retrofitting, the practice of upgrading buildings rather than knocking them down to start again, has triumphed. Lacaton & Vassal’s victory has shaken up the architectural profession and signals a remarkable shift in priorities among the world’s best city-makers. If embraced more widely, this could transform how buildings everywhere are regenerated.Architecture is typically obsessed with newness. A seemingly endless parade of industry awards shower gleaming new buildings with plaudits and praise. Like contemporary art, architecture thrives on the idea of originality, devaluing work that seems derivative. This thirst for novelty produces some innovative buildings, but it also results in numerous shiny baubles that appear principally designed for Instagram feeds.The humble and unphotogenic work of refurbishing, repairing, maintaining and upgrading existing buildings is rarely celebrated among city-making professionals. Despite campaigns to foreground refurbishment from the Architects’ Journal and others, awards routinely go to new buildings of questionable merit, even while older outstanding estates and community facilities are neglected.Far too often, precious buildings that serve valuable community roles have been demolished, such as Sheffield’s Hyde Park estate realised under city architect John Lewis Womersley, and Owen Luder and Rodney Gordon’s 1966 Tricorn Centre in Portsmouth, both of which lost battles against demolition proposals with disastrous environmental consequences.Building is one of the most polluting activities in the UK economy. The vast majority of the emissions it causes come from a combination of heating existing buildings and the energy expended in demolitions and new construction. At present, the sector emits the equivalent of 186 megatons of carbon dioxide a year. According to the UK Green Building Council, to meet Britain’s obligations under the 2008 Climate Change Act that level needs to more than halve by 2025, and halve again by 2050 – an enormous challenge for a notoriously slow-moving industry.Part of what makes this particularly difficult is that constructing almost anything requires vast amounts of energy. While new buildings can now be made very energy-efficient, the materials and processes required to construct them in the first place generate such high emissions that the net impact of new buildings is often arguably worse than building nothing at all. It’s a carbon catch-22 – existing British buildings are not energy-efficient enough to be sustainable, but knocking them down and erecting new ones will also emit more carbon than we can afford.Lacaton & Vassal’s Pritzker win hints at a solution. The key to bringing the environmental impact of architecture in line with planetary limits is to dramatically improve the energy efficiency of existing buildings while radically reducing new construction. In other words: less demolition, more refurbishment.Yet despite the ecological merits of refurbishment, many British local authorities consistently back demolition-led strategies (bizarrely, new construction is VAT exempt, while retrofitting is not). Councils often favour knocking down entire neighbourhoods and rebuilding them from scratch, rather than upgrading existing architecture. In Liverpool, for instance, the controversial housing market renewal initiative famously saw hundreds of good-quality terrace houses flattened to make way for development.Although it is endemic in the UK, this enormously inefficient and highly polluting model is exactly the kind of shortsighted practice that Lacaton & Vassal, with fellow French architect Frédéric Druot, attacked in their 2007 manifesto, Plus. In Plus, the designers condemned demolition-led architecture, declaring “Never demolish, never remove or replace, always add, transform, and reuse!”.This rallying cry is diametrically opposed to most British regeneration projects. For instance, rather than transforming and reusing its 1974 Central Library, Birmingham city council spent £200m building a new library and knocking down the adjacent original in 2013. The project was so costly that two years later, the city’s glamorous new library was forced to cut its opening hours and staff by almost half.The central case study of Plus is Lacaton & Vassal’s own refurbishment of a 1960s residential tower on Boulevard du Bois le Prêtre in Paris. The 96-apartment building had been badly reclad in the 1990s, and the municipality was poised to knock the tower down. The architects proposed keeping the building and using the money that would have been spent to fund its demolition and reconstruction on bolting prefabricated winter gardens to its facades instead.The resulting building provided every resident with more indoor space, huge new windows and generous balconies. It cost 62% less than a demolition-led approach would have done. The revitalised tower now runs on 60% less energy; overall, the refurbishment required 74% less energy than what would have been used in demolishing and rebuilding the block.Embracing Lacaton & Vassal’s anti-demolition tactics wouldn’t just cut emissions, it would safeguard communities and heritage too. The making of new buildings is often called “regeneration” but frequently couldn’t be further from it. Demolishing existing buildings often splits up communities that have taken generations to form. Frequently, the new facilities regeneration brings simply replace older facilities that degenerated through underfunding or were closed or relocated in preceding decades.Far better would be a Lacaton & Vassal-style strategy of maintaining and enhancing buildings. Imagine, for instance, if in the London borough of Lambeth, where the council is planning to knock down Rosemary Stjernstedt’s 450-home Central Hill Estate (one of Britain’s few modern masterpieces designed by a female architect), a refurbishment-led approach were chosen instead of outright demolition. Families wouldn’t be displaced, buildings could be upgraded efficiently, carbon emissions would fall dramatically.Lacaton & Vassal’s generous green refurbishments, now venerated by the profession’s highest award, are a lesson in how we could bring British architecture’s carbon emissions under control and protect communities from the wrecking ball. Less demolition. Less new construction. Epic world-class retrofitting instead.

Can we enjoy fast fashion without destroying the planet?,"The global fashion industry is in desperate need of an ecological plan, but London fashion week proved there still isn’t one – yet

From the declining lifespan of clothes to the lightning metabolism of fashion consumerism and the increased reliance on petroleum-based synthetic fibres, this is one industry desperate for an ecological plan.London fashion week – which ended this week – showed there still isn’t one. Coverage was dominated by the launch of a new collection from one of the fastest models of production and e-retail, Pretty Little Thing, owned by the Boohoo group. It didn’t seem to matter that this show was not officially part of fashion week – it had all the ingredients of a smash hit, including a social media superstar turned creative director, Molly-Mae Hague. And, in something of a plot twist, alongside the brand’s runway show came the announcement that it will launch a pre-owned resale marketplace later this year “in a bid to encourage its shoppers to embrace sustainability”.Of course reselling, reusing and extending the lifespan of garments is critical in the fight to bring some sanity into the fashion cycle. But to push out more fast fashion and then recirculate it later seems like the fashion equivalent of carbon capture storage. It may help soothe investors, but it is unlikely to decarbonise fashion.Room for rentMeanwhile, around the same time as PLT’s announcement a genuinely important fashion industry innovator – rental platform Onloan – announced that it was pressing pause, leaving a gap in the sustainable fashion ecosystem.Fashion rental platforms all have slightly different business models. Byrotation is a peer to peer lending app, charging a borrower per loan and taking a percentage from lender and renter. There’s MyWardrobe – from former Whistles CEO Jane Shepherdson, who has said she wants renting clothes to be as commonplace as renting a car; HURR, who have teamed up with Selfridges and Hirestreet, which aims to take things mainstream, providing rental for M&S.Onloan, meanwhile, offered a subscription model. Users could rent two or four pieces a month for £69 or £99. Unusually, the company bought and held stock. For co-founder Tamsin Chislett, who has a background running a fairtrade cotton project in Uganda, this is key to re-engineering the industry. “The fashion supply chain is riven with underpayment. For us it was important to pay for actual, finished garments to allow the manufacturing part of the supply chain to work,” she says.Onloan was prepared to invest in buying wholesale, offering a royalty fee every time the piece was rented and winning the trust and partnership of prestigious yet traditional designers, such as Joseph. The theory is that getting access to these brands at a fraction of the cost is part of the alchemy that can turn consumers to renters and take the heat (and carbon) out of the system.‘Risky’ businessNot everyone is convinced, though. In particular, a report published in May 2021 by respected Finnish academics put the boot in, concluding that renting clothes was less green than other options, including throwing them away. It got a lot of coverage, including in the Guardian. Not a good day for rental.But there were flaws in that study, beginning with the fact that researchers assessed the impact of renting a pair of jeans, which are rarely borrowed from such platforms. Moreover, assumptions made on logistics and garment care (the study factors in high use of dry cleaning) were not representative of the way the business works either, with many companies using new, low-impact technology.Fashion rental entrepreneurs believe they are getting to the point when they’ll soon have the data to prove that renting is the more sustainable option. But blunt analysis also fails to recognise the really big win that platforms like Onloan have achieved. They have changed the way people think about pre-worn clothes. The stigma is disappearing (something brands like PLT are no doubt fully aware of and keen to capitalise on).But, in the end, it wasn’t an unfavourable study or even the global pandemic that did for Onloan. It was a quirk of HMRC’s tax breaks for investors in ‘risky’ startups. In effect, these exclude models that hold stock, deterring investors from Onloan’s models. (As Chislett puts it, “you want to disrupt the fashion system to make it sustainable, not to fit in with HMRC’s plans to have investors pay less tax”).And so we must say goodbye to Onloan: we shall miss you from the sustainable fashion ecosystem, but we should not forget you.",2022-02-25
 Anti-logging protest becomes Canada’s biggest ever act of civil disobedience,"At least 866 arrested since April, as police condemned for violence against protesters defending Vancouver Island’s ancient forests","['Supported by', 'About this content', 'Jen Osborne in Fairy Creek and ', 'Leyland Cecco', ' in Toronto']","A string of protests against old-growth logging in western Canada have become the biggest act of civil disobedience in the country’s history, with the arrest of least 866 people since April.The bitter fight over the future of Vancouver Island’s diminishing ancient forests – in which activists used guerrilla methods of resistance such as locking their bodies to the logging road and police responded by beating, dragging and pepper-spraying demonstrators – has surpassed the previous record of arrests set in the 1990s at the anti-logging protests dubbed the “War in the Woods”.‘War in the woods’: hundreds of anti-logging protesters arrested in CanadaRead moreFor months, hundreds of activists with the Rainforest Flying Squad have camped out in the remote Fairy Creek watershed in a desperate attempt to shift the course of logging in the region.They have chained themselves to tripods crafted from logs, suspended themselves in trees and even locked their arms inside devices called “sleeping dragons” cemented into the ground.“We have experts in rigging, we have climbers, we have carpenters – we have all these people getting together to build amazing, beautiful things,” said Jean-François Savard, who has been at the camp since the injunction was granted to a logging company in April. “The [police] are getting very frustrated by our tenacity because we’re constantly rebuilding and coming up with new ideas. People aren’t giving up.”Members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police have been tasked with enforcing the injunction, but have increasingly faced sharp criticism for their tactics and use of force, including ripping off protesters masks to pepper-spray them and dragging them by their hair.Police have also come under fire for wearing “thin blue line” patches, obscuring their faces, not wearing name badges – and for their attempts to bar media from reporting on the long-running protests. Last month, a British Columbia supreme court judge ruled that the police force’s expulsions zones – set up to prevent media from entering certain areas of the injunction area to monitor police action – were unlawful.The RCMP did not respond to a request for comment, but Sgt Chris Manseau has previously told reporters that while police action is dictated by the actions of demonstrators and social media doesn’t show the entirety of events, a review of police action is likely.“The more violent the RCMP are, the more it radicalizes younger people. We have teenagers who are getting arrested, who are risking their lives,” said Pia Massie, who was also present at the blockages at Clayoquot Sound in 1993. “As mom, it’s very, very scary. And that’s why I keep coming back – to try to counsel people, to try to protect people.”Other veterans of the War in the Woods say the current police conduct has been “utterly disgusting”.“At Clayoquot, the relationship between us and the RCMP was almost cordial. They did their job, we did ours,” said Warren Kimmit. “That was the way policing should happen. There’s no question there’s nothing to be gained by the violence that’s happening here. And that violence is just increasing as they become frustrated with our ability to lock the road down.”At stake for the activists are swaths of old growth forest on the south-western watersheds of Vancouver Island. These trees – towering western red cedar, Douglas fir and Sitka spruce – are often hundreds of years old, and are the few remaining pockets of original old growth forest. Most have been logged.Activists have camped out in the Fairy Creek watershed in an attempt to shift the course of logging in the region. Photograph: Jen OsborneWhile the blockades have made headlines and figured into the country’s national election, they have also exposed both the legacy of old growth logging in a vulnerable ecosystem and the complex politics of the region, where a number of local First Nations receive royalties from logging operations.The Pacheedaht elected council has a revenue sharing agreement with the logging company Teal-Jones Group and have repeatedly asked demonstrators to leave the area and to respect the sovereignty of the nation.“We do not welcome or support unsolicited involvement or interference by others in our Territory, including third-party activism,” hereditary chief Frank Queesto Jones said in a letter from April.Queesto Jones and fellow chief councillor Jeff Jones say the nation has grown worried about the “increasing polarization” over forestry activities and the anti-old growth logging movement.But Pacheedaht elder Bill Jones, who has previously alleged that Frank Jones was not a true hereditary chief and did not represent the will of the nation, has become a key figure in the blockades.“We’re surprised at the RCMP’s determination to crush us. We all come to the conclusion that it’s not just us they’re wanting to crush – they want to protect the economic and regulatory process that the Canadian government uses to get what they want off the land, under the directions of the large corporations,” said Jones.Photography campaign shows the grim aftermath of logging in Canada's fragile forestsRead moreIn June, the province of British Columbia and Pacheedaht, Ditidaht and Huu-ay-aht First Nations announced a two-year moratorium on cutting, a deal that protesters rejected, pointing out that other areas – the Caycuse and Walbran valleys – are slated for logging.But those at the camps believe the confrontations at the blockades only underscore the stakes and the need for swift action to protect the few remaining stands of forest.“The civil disobedience movement is very simple. We put our bodies on the line, we almost expect to be injured, we expect to be in a very uncomfortable situation,” said Warren Kimmit. “Our willingness to do that is what causes the public to see our commitment to a cause, to rally them and to put pressure on the government to act.”",2021-09-10
" This article is more than 3 months oldThreats to Germany’s climate campaigners fuelled by politicians’ rhetoric, says activistThis article is more than 3 months old","Luisa Neubauer, of Fridays for Future, cites language used by the chancellor amid protest crackdown

Human rights experts warn against European crackdown on climate protesters
How criminalisation is being used to silence climate activists across the world
",['Ajit Niranjan'],"Severe policing and “scary” political rhetoric is fuelling abuse against climate activists, Germany’s best-known environmentalist has said.“It’s not a shift any more, it’s a slide,” said Luisa Neubauer, from the German branch of Fridays for Future, the protest movement that grew out of Greta Thunberg’s school strikes. “There’s an increase in hate language, there’s an increase in threats, and the threats are getting more concrete. So they’re not saying any more ‘I hate you’ but they’re saying ‘We should come to your place, we should go get you.’”Germany has increasingly cracked down on climate protests as they have grown more disruptive, with police using laws designed to fight organised crime to tap phones, raid homes, freeze bank accounts and place activists in preventive detention. In September, the human rights group Amnesty International added Germany to a list of countries where the state was restricting the public’s right to protest.“The shift that we’re seeing – the sliding of societal normality – that is not just something that has to do with laws and police presence,” said Neubauer. “This is something to do with rhetoric that has been taken over in almost the entire democratic party spectrum in Germany.”A government spokesperson said Amnesty was wrong to include Germany in its map and that protest was always possible, but must be within the framework of the law. They said: “From our point of view, engagement in climate protection should unite us as a society, not divide us.”Activists argue it is the increasingly extreme rhetoric from mainstream political parties that is doing just that.Senior politicians in Germany have compared Last Generation, a nonviolent protest group that has blockaded motorways and thrown paint on glass-covered artworks, to terrorist organisations such as the Red Army Faction, a far-left group that killed dozens of people in the 1970s and 80s. Earlier this year, in tweets that have since been deleted, politicians from the centre-left and centre-right parties drew links between Last Generation and the Taliban.The chancellor, Olaf Scholz, who has described the protests as “completely idiotic”, appeared to compare climate activists to Nazis last year after two people disrupted a panel at which he was speaking in Stuttgart. “Let me say frankly, these black-clad spectacles at different events, always by the same people, remind me of a time that lies long in the past – and thank God for that,” he said, to loud applause.Scholz and his team denied he was referring to the Nazis in interviews and press conferences over the days that followed, but refused to say which other black-clad group from history he could have meant. When asked again by the Guardian whom Scholz had meant, the government spokesperson referred to a previous statement from a colleague who had said “the chancellor’s comments stand for themselves”.Neubauer, who criticised Scholz’s comparison at the time, said his language had changed the way people saw activists. “He is the leader of the country. People read his remarks … and suddenly feel a complete new ownership, accusing me and making threats against activists like me and others,” she said.A member of Neubauer’s security detail agreed with her assessment that threats against her had grown more common and concrete. The security guard shared an internal report compiled the week after the event in Stuttgart that documented “very many hate comments”, some violent and threatening, in particular under articles about Scholz. “There were often comments that Scholz was right and they [climate activists] were like the ‘Sturmabteilung’, ‘fascists’ or ‘climate terrorists’,” the report found.The threats have grown to a point where Neubauer, a 27-year-old geography student, goes to lectures with a bodyguard. She said she had to decline a recent request to sign an open letter in support of asylum seekers “because I knew that weekend my security guards were on a break”.The hate is “99.9% from men”, she added. “They had websites open where people would fantasise about how best to rape me.”Climate activists at a Fridays for Future demonstration last month at the, Brandenburg Gate, Berlin. Photograph: Marten Ronneburg/NurPhoto/ShutterstockThere was a broad swell of support in Germany for the climate movement in 2019 as Fridays for Future protests sprang up across the country. But public opinion has soured as protesters from Last Generation, who want to raise the level of urgency and put more pressure on politicians, have turned to disruptive stunts that are more likely to grab headlines and get people talking about the climate crisis.A study from More in Common, a nonprofit pushing for social cohesion, found that general support for the climate movement in Germany has fallen from 68% to 34% in the last two years. The share of people who agreed that the climate movement has “the wellbeing of all of society in mind” fell from 60% to 25%.Neubauer said there were initially lively debates within Fridays for Future about how closely to align with Last Generation, “but now after one and a half years with nothing but a political backlash this is really changing. People are worried there’s no strategy to counter the backlash.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Headlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The government strengthened the law with tougher targets for each sector of the economy. Ministers were ordered to come up with an “immediate action plan” if they failed to meet their targets.How Germany, France and Italy compare on net zero emission targetsRead moreBut since then, sectors such as transport and buildings have seen little consequence for failing to cut pollution as fast as the law requires. The government’s scientific watchdog declared the transport minister’s latest action plan too weak to qualify for a full analysis, while the environment agency said its planned measures would “barely” narrow the gap between projected emissions and targets.In June, after pressure from the Free Democrat party that controls the transport ministry, the cabinet agreed to scrap the sectoral targets from its climate law altogether.Neubauer said: “I think we will look back and they will look back and we’re going to be deeply ashamed about what is happening right now – and how we see democracies under fire from the right, but also from the climate crisis.”The government spokesperson said climate protection was a top priority for the federal government, and the goal of climate neutrality by 2045 was more important than ever. “Climate protection efforts are successful when society and the state work together. We all bear responsibility for our environment. The young generation in particular has high expectations of politics for good reasons.”The spokesperson listed several measures the government was taking to cut emissions, but did not address its failure to meet targets set out in its climate law.“Honestly, right now, I don’t know where this is going to end,” said Neubauer. “Because activists are getting more frustrated, for all the good reasons, society is getting more aggressive for their reasons, and the police are standing inbetween, but clearly taking the side of those who are attacking activists … And our politicians pretend they have nothing to do with that. That’s so cruel.”",2023-10-12
 This article is more than 5 months old‘Misunderstood’ red-bellied piranhas go on display at Chester zooThis article is more than 5 months old,"Despite fearsome reputation, fish prefers scavenging to hunting and swims in shoals for protection, say experts",['Morgan Ofori'],"Forty red-bellied piranhas have made their debut at Chester zoo in a move aquarists say they hope will help to rehabilitate the fish's name away from its fearsome reputation.People associate piranhas with viciously attacking unsuspecting prey, as depicted in numerous blockbuster movies, but experts say they prefer to scavenge for food rather than hunt.It is the first time fish specialists have cared for the species at the zoo in more than 30 years.The aquarium team manager, Hannah Thomas, said piranhas were “very much misunderstood”.“They are meat-eaters with sharp teeth that sometimes nip the fins and tails of other fish,” she said. “But a good portion of their diet comes from hoovering up bits of dead flesh and dead fish found in rivers, as well as insects and various plant materials.”She said they played an important role in maintaining the balance of aquatic ecosystems and that other species would be unable to thrive without them.“Red-bellied piranhas can often be seen swimming in shoals, but this has little to do with coordinated hunting and is a lot more to do with self-defence. Piranhas often fall victim to larger fish, birds, caimans and Amazon river dolphins so, like many animals, they huddle together for protection,” Thomas said.The piranhas, which are native to South America, can now be found inside the zoo’s Spirit of the Jaguar habitat in a special Latin American tank, connecting visitors with the underwater world of the Amazon.The move is part of the zoo’s commitment to a 10-year conservation plan, which by 2031 aims to reverse the decline of 200 threatened populations of species in the wild.Chester zoo is home to 3,000 species globally, including 140 international animal conservation breeding programmes, which are ensuring the survival of species on the brink of extinction.It works with a range of partners in more than 20 countries to recover threatened wildlife and restore habitats, including orangutans in Bornean rainforests, elephants and tigers in Indian grasslands, lemurs and frogs in Malagasy forests, rare fish in Mexican lakes and a host of UK species.It is hoped that closer monitoring of the piranhas will sustain them in their role as natural balancers in the wild.“They’re a very special species and we as a team are feeling privileged to be able to start caring for them here in Chester and discovering more about them,” Thomas said.",2023-07-28
 This article is more than 8 months old‘Like a dam breaking’: experts hail decision to let US climate lawsuits advanceThis article is more than 8 months old,Cities bringing climate litigation against oil majors welcome US supreme court’s decision to rebuff appeal to move cases to federal courts,['Hilary Beaumont'],"The decision, climate experts and advocates said, felt “like a dam breaking” after years of legal delays to the growing wave of climate lawsuits facing major oil companies.Without weighing in on the merits of the cases, the supreme court on Monday rebuffed an appeal by major oil companies that want to face the litigation in federal courts, rather than in state courts, which are seen as more favorable to plaintiffs.ExxonMobil Corp, Suncor Energy Inc and Chevron Corp had asked for the change of venue in lawsuits by the state of Rhode Island and municipalities in Colorado, Maryland, California and Hawaii.‘Appalling’ Earth Day greenwashing must not detract from message, says protest founderRead moreSix years have passed since the first climate cases were filed in the US, and courts have not yet heard the merits of the cases as fossil fuel companies have succeeded in delaying them. In March, the Biden administration had argued that the cases belonged in state court, marking a reversal of the position taken by the Trump administration when the supreme court last considered the issue.The Rhode Island attorney general, Peter Neronha, said his state was now finally preparing for trial after “nearly half a decade of delay tactics” by the industry. A joint statement from the California cities of Santa Cruz, San Mateo and Richmond and Marin county said the oil companies knew the dangers of fossil fuels but “deceived and failed to warn consumers about it even as they carried on pocketing trillions of dollars in profits”.The cases have been compared to tobacco lawsuits in the 1990s that resulted in a settlement of more than $200bn and changed how cigarettes are advertised and sold in the US.“It was a really amazing feeling to see that the supreme court was ruling in a very logical way by continuing with the unanimous decisions that have been made in the previous courts to not [grant petitions for review] and to allow these cases to move forward,” said Delta Merner, lead scientist at the Science Hub for Climate Litigation.“It removes this dam that industry has been building to prevent these cases from being heard on their merits,” she said. “We can finally have the real conversations about what the industry knew and what their actions were despite that knowledge.”She hopes communities will have the chance to speak in court about the climate emergencies they are experiencing as a result of the industry’s actions.As jurisdictional battles have dragged on, climate emergencies have added up.The Suncor oil refinery in Commerce City, Colorado. Photograph: Ted Wood/The GuardianThe Colorado case was filed in 2018. In 2021, the state saw the Marshall fire, the most destructive wildfire in its history, which killed two people, destroyed nearly 1,000 homes and businesses, contaminated drinking water and amounted to billions in damages.“There’s real impacts that are happening now, and that’s why it’s so important for these cases to have the opportunity to be heard, and have a chance for justice,” Merner said.The cases allege fossil fuel companies exacerbated climate change by concealing and misrepresenting the dangers associated with burning fossil fuels. The lawsuits say the companies created a public and private nuisance and violated state consumer protection laws by producing and selling fossil fuels despite knowing the products would cause devastating climate emergencies, including melting ice caps, dramatic sea level rise, and extreme precipitation and drought. Local governments are seeking damages for the billions of dollars they have paid for climate mitigation and adaptation.The oil companies have denied the allegations.Financial accountability“We were all pretty excited. It feels like justice might be possible,” Richard Wiles, president of the Center for Climate Integrity, said after reading the decision on Monday.“There’s clearly trillions of dollars of damages in the US alone from climate change that has to be dealt with.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Rulings against the companies could also reinforce banking industry concerns that fossil fuels are a risky investment.In state court, fossil fuel companies will attempt to have the cases dismissed.The Chevron attorney Theodore Boutrous said in a statement he was confident the cases would be dismissed, arguing that climate change requires a coordinated federal response, “not a disjointed patchwork” of actions from numerous state courts. “These wasteful lawsuits in state courts will do nothing to advance global climate solutions, nothing to reduce emissions and nothing to address climate-related impacts,” he said.“I don’t think there’s any reason for that confidence yet,” said Korey Silverman-Roati, climate law fellow at the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, in response to Boutrous.There’s a growing number of lawsuits. And I imagine after today, that will continueDelta Merner of the Science Hub for Climate LitigationIt’s unclear what will happen in state courts, but Silverman-Roati pointed to the Hawaii case, in which a state court denied the industry’s motion to dismiss.If plaintiffs clear motions to dismiss, the cases move to discovery. The plaintiffs will use the process to try to gather more evidence of what the companies knew and when they knew it. Internal company documents will probably become public when the trials get under way.Recent studies have shown that Exxon accurately predicted that its products would cause climate change.Attribution science will play a key role in connecting local climate disasters to the industry’s responsibility. “Studies can explain how much hotter a heatwave is, or how much greater the intensity of a downpour is during a hurricane event due to climate change. And they can look to see where those emissions came from, and what percentage of those emissions tie into those direct climate impacts,” Merner said.With each decision in favor of plaintiffs, the cases are snowballing and more local governments are filing new cases. “There’s a growing number of lawsuits. And I imagine after today, that will continue,” Merner said.",2023-04-25
 This article is more than 10 months oldUS justice department sues two companies over pollution in Louisiana’s ‘Cancer Alley’This article is more than 10 months old,"Japanese company Denka, along with US chemicals giant DuPont, have operated the plant that produces cancer-causing chloroprene","['Oliver Laughland', ' in New Orleans', '@oliverlaughland']","The US justice department has sued the two petrochemical giants behind a facility in Louisiana’s “Cancer Alley” responsible for the highest cancer risk rates caused by air pollution in the US in a major federal lawsuit that seeks to substantially curb the plant’s emissions.Unveiled on Tuesday, the lawsuit alleges emissions at the Pontchartrain Works facility in Reserve, Louisiana, violate the Clean Air Act and “present an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and welfare”.Cancer and chemicals in Reserve, Louisiana: the science explainedRead moreThe move marks a significant escalation of the Biden administration’s enforcement action in the Cancer Alley region, and was instantly hailed by members of the predominantly Black community around the plant as a major victory in their ongoing campaign for clean air.Suing on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the justice department is now seeking a federal court order to compel Denka (DPE), the Japanese chemical giant operating the facility, to “immediately take all necessary measures” to curb emissions of the compound chloroprene, labeled by the EPA as a likely human carcinogen.The facility is the only site in the US to emit the compound, which is a primary constituent of the synthetic rubber neoprene. EPA air monitoring around the facility has consistently shown readings well in excess of the recommended lifetime exposure limit of 0.2 micrograms per cubic meter.“This will have a tremendous impact on our struggle here,” said Robert Taylor, a founder of Concerned Citizens of St John Parish. “Over the six years we have been fighting this fight we haven’t had anything as great as this to happen in terms of getting concrete action on emissions.”Speaking to the Guardian, Taylor added: “The state government has totally ignored us – marches on the capitol, rallying – they wouldn’t even give us an audience. And for the administration to come in and do this, it just validates our efforts.”EPA administrator Michael Regan said in a statement that he had promised “strong action” for community members during a site visit to Reserve in November 2021.“This complaint filed against Denka delivers on that promise,” Regan said. “The company has not moved far enough or fast enough to reduce emissions or ensure the safety of the surrounding community. This action is not the first step we have taken to reduce risks to the people living in St John the Baptist Parish, and it will not be the last.”The Fifth Ward elementary school and residential neighborhoods sit near the Denka plant, back left, in Reserve, Louisiana. Photograph: Gerald Herbert/APA statement issued by Denka on Tuesday said the company “strongly disagrees” with the legal action and urged the EPA to re-evaluate its findings on chloroprene exposure. The company has been lobbying the federal government for years, claiming the compound’s peer-reviewed classification is based on outdated science.“DPE is in compliance with its air permits and applicable law. EPA is taking an unprecedented step – deviating from its permitting and rulemaking authorities – to allege an ‘emergency’ based on outdated and erroneous science the agency released over 12 years ago,” the statement said.The lawsuit also names a subsidiary of the US chemicals giant DuPont, which constructed the Pontchartrain Works facility as a neoprene plant and operated it for over half a century.DuPont sold the plant to Denka in 2015 in a secretive deal, which the Guardian later revealed was motivated by concerns from DuPont that it would face heavier regulation after the EPA’s decision to classify chloroprene as a likely human carcinogen. The revelations were part of a years-long Guardian series examining air pollution in Reserve and throughout Cancer Alley.DuPont remains the owner of the land beneath Denka’s facility and acts as a landlord, according to the complaint, meaning DuPont may need to grant permissions in order for emissions to be reduced.DuPont did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In a statement, associate attorney general Vanita Gupta said: “The justice department’s environmental justice efforts require ensuring that every community, no matter its demographics, can breathe clean air and drink clean water. Our suit aims to stop Denka’s dangerous pollution.”The lawsuit contains further details of the plant’s recent chloroprene emissions, which fell after Denka constructed emissions offset technology after its purchase of the plant, but still remains dangerously high and in some locations 14 times over the recommended exposure limit.According to EPA calculations in the suit, current chloroprene emissions present a risk “that is especially grave for infants and children under the age of 16”. The suit claims that emissions remain so high that a child breathing air near certain monitors around the facility’s fence line would exceed their lifetime excess cancer risk within two years.Either they use their money and do it right or face the power of the EPAMary Hampton of Concerned Citizens of St John Parish“In the aggregate, the thousands of people breathing this air are incurring a significantly higher cancer risk than would be typically allowed, and they are being exposed to a much greater cancer risk from Denka’s air pollution than the majority of United States residents face,” the suit states.The justice department complaint does not directly specify that Denka should reduce its emissions to the 0.2 micrograms lifetime exposure recommendation, but cites the guidance throughout the complaint.Mary Hampton, another founder of Concerned Citizens of St John Parish, said the lawsuit was the culmination of years of advocacy from community members and represented that “finally we have a little hope”.“This makes me feel like we have something to look forward to, not five or 10 years from now – we need it to happen now.”Hampton urged both Denka and DuPont to comply with the federal government’s demands set forth in the lawsuit.“They know they can comply,” Hampton said. “And either they use their money and do it right or face the power of the EPA.”",2023-03-01
‘It’s a struggle for survival’: why Kenya – and its wildlife – need tourists to return,"Covid dealt a blow to tourism and the conservation funds it provides. But as visitors slowly return, the sector is looking for new ways to thrive","['Supported by', 'About this content', 'Peter Muiruri']","Every day, for the past 20 years, Joyce Naserian has laid out her handmade curios near an entrance to the Masai Mara park to sell to passing tourists. Her earnings have helped the 46-year-old feed and educate all four of her children.In northern Kenya, about 1,200 semi-nomadic women earned more than 9m Kenyan shillings (£62,000) selling beadwork to visitors at 43 community wildlife conservancies in 2020. Just as it was Naserian in the Mara, selling the beadwork was a solid money earner for these women. But that was before Covid.The collapse of eco-tourism during the pandemic has spelled disaster for conservation initiatives and livelihoods in Kenya and beyond. Cuts to budgets and staff, reduced salaries and stalled development and education projects have plunged communities into poverty, leading to a rise in poaching and the illegal wildlife trade.Reuters reported that in the first three months of 2020, the African continent lost $55bn (£44bn) in travel and tourism revenues – funds that go towards running conservation programmes that benefit local communities.A Maasai woman with her display of decorative beads and other traditional items for tourists. Since the pandemic international visitors have been slow to return to Kenya. Photograph: Kathy Hancock/AlamyKenya’s government has relaxed a raft of travel restrictions, but the return of international tourists has been slow, while concerns about carbon emissions from long-haul air travel may be putting people off flying into conservation areas.“It is a real struggle for survival,” says Daniel Sopia, head of Masai Mara Wildlife Conservancies Association. “Women who relied solely on beadwork were badly affected as there was not a single tourist coming to the Mara at the height of Covid-19 restrictions. Household income dropped significantly and they had to rely on food from well-wishers.”The 15 wildlife conservancies that Sopia heads comprise individual blocks of land owned by Maasai people. The landowners lease the land, covering 14,0426 hectares (347,000 acres), to safari camps and lodges, which pay fees that fund projects providing water, healthcare and education, as well as setting up small businesses.In return, the 14,500 landowners protect biodiversity within the Mara ecosystem while preserving their traditional lifestyle.Four years before the pandemic, the conservancies contributed almost 120m Kenyan shillings to social programmes in the region. Two years ago, payments to landowners fell by 50%, forcing conservancies to scale back operations and focus on priorities such as allowances to wildlife rangers. Sopia and his team had to scramble to prevent the total collapse of conservation programmes.“Conservancies remained operational throughout the pandemic despite the lack in tourism income,” says Sopia. “We were fortunate to mobilise some resources from development partners and private foundations. These helped to cover rangers’ salaries, food rations, fuel, and vehicle maintenance.“We hope the arrangement will be in place till June 2022 as we slowly wean the conservancies off such aid,” he says.A Maasai man wears traditional beaded bracelets. Photograph: Eric Lafforgue/Art in All of Us/Corbis/Getty ImagesSome foreign organisations are now making a comeback after a two-year hiatus. In March 2022, UK charity Tusk brought together conservation professionals from across Africa for a symposium in Masai Mara to help organisations diversify fundraising and build resilient units.Since 1990, Tusk has raised more than £80m towards conservation projects across more than 20 African countries and helped to protect more than 40 threatened species. Tusk’s upcoming Wildlife Ranger Challenge seeks to raise money for rangers whose pay was slashed in the pandemic.“The last two years have been extremely tough for everyone. The conservation sector in particular has had to endure huge losses, dramatic cutbacks in operating budgets, and, sadly, redundancies,” says Charlie Mayhew, Tusk Trust chief executive.Wanjiku Kinuthia, strategyhead at Maliasili, hopes the renewed interest in broadening discussions about African conservation will boost small organisations that are often left out of big decisions, despite being closest to the vulnerable communities bearing the brunt of a collapsing environment.Africa’s park tourism crash is a wake-up call. Can we find new ways to finance conservation? | Peter MuiruriRead more“They often miss out on global dialogues,” says Kinuthia, whose group supports about 20 other organisations in seven countries, including smaller ones that lack the networks to make their voices heard. “They do not understand how the media works or how to tell their stories. We can be catalysts of change for such grassroots organisations.”Involving communities in conservation would safeguard the 65% of wildlife that lives outside protected areas, she says. “All people need are tools to help them coexist with animals in the 21st century while benefiting from conservation.”However, some conservationists say the only way to sustain conservation programmes and avoid disruption is by governments increasing budgets to the sector, a challenge considering the current low levels of state investment.Dickson Kaelo, who heads the Kenya Wildlife Conservancies Association, says African countries depend on foreign donors to fund development and conservation is no exception.“There is no single answer to cutting off foreign aid,” says Kaelo. “There are no government incentives for setting up a conservancy to protect an elephant that walks all over destroying life and property.“If you are in the farming sector, you can get a loan to buy a tractor, but there is no institution that gives loans for those who want to invest in protecting wildlife, and while a person buying a vehicle to ferry tourists gets some tax rebates, we get no such benefits when buying a truck for wildlife rangers.”He adds: “Through a private member’s bill, parliament might create laws that hamper conservation including the Natural Resources (Benefits Sharing) Bill, with a formula that will see those in conservation give 80% of their proceeds to government and a paltry 12.8% to local communities.In addition, the government requires that you come up with a management plan, a strategic and environmental study, multiple registration procedures and other permits before setting up a private conservancy. If you want to lease land you have to pay 2% stamp duty for the entire period, say for 20 years, and pay that upfront. Why don’t we see such laws when someone wants to cut down a tree?”Kaddu Sebunya, chief executive at the African Wildlife Foundation says Africans must be exposed to the benefits of wildlife and wild lands so they can lead on conservation. A starting point would be to make tourism more accessible, he says, “as it is easier for someone in New York or Sydney to book a tour to Africa than someone living in Harare or Lagos.”.“Building our domestic and regional tourism market will be a stepping stone to increasing the African voice for conservation. While millions of Africans traverse the continent to travel for business, how can these numbers be translated to nature tourists?“Data from Unctad [UN Conference on Trade and Development] indicates that four out of 10 international tourists in Africa come from the continent, and this begs the question, ‘is our product marketing catering to the four Africans?’It is high time for a shift in mindset,” says Sebunya.Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:Sign up for Global Dispatch – please check your spam folder for the confirmation email",2022-10-19
 ‘Extinct’ parrots make a flying comeback in Brazil,"The Spix macaw, a bird that had once vanished in the wild, is now thriving in its South American homeland after a successful breeding programme",['Robin McKie'],"Twenty years ago, the future of the Spix’s macaw could not have looked bleaker. The last member of this distinctive parrot species disappeared from the wild, leaving only a few dozen birds in collectors’ cages across the globe. The prospects for Cyanopsitta spixii were grim, to say the least.But thanks to a remarkable international rescue project, Spix’s macaws – with their grey heads and vivid blue plumage – have made a stunning comeback. A flock now soars freely over its old homeland in Brazil after being released there a month ago. Later this year, conservationists plan to release more birds, and hope the parrots will start breeding in the wild next spring.A macaw wildlife refuge has been established in the north-eastern state of Bahia in Brazil“The project is going extremely well,” said biologist Tom White, of the US Fish and Wildlife Service and a technical adviser to the rescue project. “It’s almost a month since we released the birds and all of them have survived.“They are acting as a flock; they are staying in the vicinity of their release and they are beginning to sample local vegetation. It’s going as well as it possibly could.”The Spix’s macaw – named in honour of the German biologist Johann Baptist Ritter von Spix, who first collected a specimen in 1819 – became the victim of a double environmental whammy that began in the 19th century. As farming spread across South America, the parrot’s homeland – in an area of shrubland and thorn forest known as the Caatinga in north-east Brazil – was overgrazed by goats and other livestock. The land was severely eroded, and macaw numbers dropped as their habitat was destroyed.“That loss in numbers had a very unfortunate secondary effect,” said White. “As soon as an animal becomes endangered, collectors want to have one. And that is what happened to the Spix’s macaw. They became rare and, as a result, unscrupulous individuals decided to try to take the few that remained in the wild for their private collections.”The future for the species looked dismal until the bird’s fortunes were revived by, of all things, an animated film. Rio, the story of a domesticated male Spix’s macaw called Blu, who is taken to Rio de Janeiro to mate with a free-spirited female, Jewel, was released in 2011. The film, and its sequel, Rio 2, earned almost $1bn. Crucially, the films revealed the threat facing the species to a global audience.The 2011 animation Rio, the story of a domesticated Spix’s macaw, revealed the predicament of the species to a global audience. Photograph: 20th Century Fox/Sportsphoto/AllstarLater, in 2018, Michel Temer, then president of Brazil, signed a decree that established a macaw wildlife refuge in the north-eastern state of Bahia, while a breeding programme, using parrots from private collections, was established at various centres across the world. A key player in this collaboration was the German-based organisation the Association for the Conservation of Threatened Parrots.The growing sophistication of modern genetics also played an important role in saving the Spix’s macaw, said White.“When you are trying to build up numbers of animals from a very small surviving population, inbreeding can be a real problem. However, the techniques used to check the genetic status of these birds were very, very sophisticated and allowed breeders to match birds very carefully.“Artificial insemination has also made it easier to produce offspring from birds.”As a result, several hundred Spix’s macaws have now been bred in captivity, and eight of these were taken in June to Bahia for release. And they had company: along with the Spix’s macaws, eight Illiger’s macaws were also let loose on 11 June.White said: “The Spix’s macaws that we now possess are the end result of generations of captive breeding, and that will have taken the edge off some of their instinctive survival skills.“However, by mixing them with Illiger’s macaws – who were basically just wild birds brought briefly into captivity – the Spix’s benefit by associating with a native species that is sharp and alert, and can show them where they get food and alert them to potential predators.”The birds, each tagged with radio transmitters, are now being monitored carefully. “We will release another 12 Spix’s macaws in December if everything goes well,” added White.“These birds will all be of reproductive age. We have also ensured there are several nest cavities, some natural and artificial, in the area to encourage the birds to begin mating next year and eventually establish breeding territories in the area.“It’s ambitious but so far things are going well.”",2022-07-10
NT government rejects Glencore bid to build toxic dump near sacred site,"Mining company’s proposed rock dump at McArthur River zinc and lead mine would have been largest built structure in the territory

","['Royce Kurmelovs', ' and ', 'Lorena Allam']","An application by mining company Glencore to build a massive toxic tailings dump on the edge of a sacred site has been rejected by the Northern Territory government.The controversial McArthur River mine, which is one of world’s largest zinc and lead mines, is roughly 900km south-east of Darwin and borders the Barramundi Dreaming sacred site, near Borroloola.On Tuesday, NT heritage minister, Chansey Paech, tabled a decision in parliament to reject an application to build the rock dump – which would stand as the largest built structure in the Northern Territory – to within 35 metres of the site.Josie Davey, a Gudanji woman and traditional owner of the mine site, and her husband, Jack Green, a senior Garawa lawman, welcomed the decision saying the company would now have to negotiate properly with traditional owners.“It was the best thing,” Green said. “It should have happened before, properly, if they were to come and sit down and talk to the traditional owners of the area. All of us are happy now, it took us a long time to come to an agreement like this.”They described the proposal as a “new mountain” and Davey said significant damage had already been done by the company over the past two decades.“I feel sad at what they have done. Because this is my great, great-grandfather’s country. And for our people,” Davey said.‘Legacy of sadness’: Glencore says sorry to traditional owners over NT mine as it seeks expansionRead moreUnder its expansion plans, Glencore – which took over the mine in 2006 – sought to expand its tailings dump to within 35 metres of the Barramundi Dreaming sacred site, which rises to a height of 80 metres, and is one of 24 sacred sites on the mine lease.The dump would stand at a height of 140 metres, with a 6km square footprint, making it taller than the Sydney Harbour Bridge at 134 metres with an area larger than Uluru, which measures roughly 3.33km square.

The weight of the structure would have likely altered the groundwater table and would need to be monitored for 1,000 years due to the high acid content of the waste rock. The highly combustible rock dissolves easily and the chemical runoff can seep into groundwater and nearby river systems.There is also another valuable archaeological site in the area, an ancient stone quarry that is part of local songlines and where local Aboriginal people mass produced stone tools, axe heads, knives and spear tips.This site is not covered in Tuesday’s decision and Glencore has made a separate application with Paech to demolish it. The company continues to widen the tailings dump while it waits for approval to build higher.In making its application, the company claimed it had consulted with traditional owners but when the Aboriginal Areas Protection Authority (AAPA) reviewed the matter, they determined the agreement was invalid.None of the site’s 180 custodians had been consulted while the six signatories who had did not necessarily understand what they agreed to or were not given copies of the contract.AAPA CEO Dr Benedict Scambary said Tuesday’s decision demonstrated that negotiation with traditional owners was “not a box to be ticked”.‘It should have happened before’: Gudanji woman and traditional owner Josie Davey and her husband Jack Green, a senior Garawa lawman, on the McArthur River crossing bridge. Photograph: Rebecca Parker“One of the things this decision will do is put other proponents of development in the Northern Territory on notice that murky deals done without representation, that are designed to disempower Aboriginal people in the protection of the sacred sites and cultural heritage, won’t pass muster,” he said.Co-director of the Environment Centre NT, Kirsty Howey, also said the decision was a “watershed” moment in the history of an “extraordinarily damaging mine authorised in extraordinary circumstances”.“We’ve never seen a Labor government minister in the NT back traditional owners on this mine which has been enormously destructive and damaging to traditional owners for years,” Howey said.“Minister Paech should be applauded for having the backbone to stand up to Glencore.”The NT Environment Centre is currently involved in legal action against the territory government over approvals given by Nicole Manison in 2020 for its expansion.A spokesperson for McArthur River mine said in a statement the company is in negotiations with the Northern Land Council, acting on behalf of traditional owners, but “remains committed to further developments at our mine site”.Cost to rehabilitate Kakadu uranium mine site could blow out by $1.2bnRead more“We remain committed to these negotiations and broad consultation with traditional owners on a variety of matters, including sacred sites and cultural heritage protection, to ensure the benefits of our operations are shared with TOs and the wider community.”The McArthur River mine has been subject to several current and historical litigations, and was a suspected source of lead contamination in drinking water used by the Borroloola’s Aboriginal community until an investigation found there was no indication the contamination was related to the mine.An effort to keep the company from diverting the river in order to allow it to mine the riverbed was successful in court but ultimately overridden by the NT Government to allow work to proceed.The company apologised for its treatment of Aboriginal people and traditional owners in 2021, and specifically for the river diversion.",2022-02-16
,"One of the world’s great natural spectacles is under way in the eastern US, stretching from the deep south to upstate New York",,"At first, the noise pulsing from the drooping elm tree boughs seemed to be coming from the power lines erected nearby. Like a surging electrical current, the sound fizzed to a crescendo on the ears before receding slightly, only to build up again to a loud, vibrating whirr.It was only on the approach to the tree, as desiccated bodies crunched underfoot and small but sturdy creatures sporting wings and orange eyes suddenly clung on to our calf muscles, that it became apparent what was causing such a huge racket: millions of cicadas had just erupted from the earth.One of the world’s great natural spectacles is under way in the eastern US, stretching from the deep south to upstate New York. Trillions of periodic cicadas are emerging en masse from a 17-year dormancy underground to clamber up trees, let out calls that rattle the eardrums, furiously mate and hand off the next leg of an extraordinary evolutionary cycle to their offspring.“This is a spectacular chorus, just incredible” said Michael Raupp, an entomologist at the University of Maryland who happily lets one of the insects crawl up his cheek. We are beside a small stand of trees in Columbia, Maryland, a leafy commuter suburb near Washington. It’s swelteringly hot, a pleasing temperature for the screeching cicadas.cicadas on michaelLeft: Cicadas crawl up the face of entomologist Michael Raupp in Columbia, Maryland, on 21 May. Right: A cicada on a leaf. Photographs by Gabriella Demczuk/The GuardianCicadas swarm the trees of a home in Columbia, Maryland, on 21 May. Photograph: Gabriella Demczuk/The GuardianThe scene is not only raucous – a swarm of cicadas can produce a sound that reaches around 100 decibels, louder than a revving motorcycle – but also grisly. Cicadas flail around in a stupor on their backs, some lie squashed, others are picked off by a red-shouldered hawk that is shoveling insects into the gaping maws of two ravenous chicks in a nearby nest. The amber-colored exoskeletons shed by the cicadas litter the seething ground and pockmark the trunk and branches of the elm tree.Millions, perhaps billions, of the insects don’t even make it to this point. In the past 17 years, much of the ground containing cicadas has been paved over for roads and driveways and shopping malls. Their foot-deep refuges became tombs, even before the cicadas could run the gauntlet of the overland.Raupp scrabbled in the dirt to show the small holes where more fortunate cicadas managed to tunnel to daylight using their shovel-like front legs. At first, the nymphs are a ghostly white before shedding their skins and developing a hardened exoskeleton. The task is to then ascend a tree, with the males creating what Raupp calls a “big boy band” of noise to attract females for mating.Some broods emerge in 13-year cycles and others in 17-year periods and while there is no definitive explanation for this phenomenon, many entomologists believe the cicadas have developed this as a defensive move against predators. No foe – squirrel, hawk or raccoon – will live the 17 years to lie in wait, with the massed synchronized numbers always allowing enough survivors to breed and kickstart the next generation. Underground, the cicadas either track the passing years from the burst in plant activity each spring or rely upon some sort of internal clock, their own circadian rhythm.Cicadas swarm in a box at the home of entomologist Michael Raupp in Columbia, Maryland. Photograph: Gabriella Demczuk/The GuardianBoth males and females are drawn to the males with the loudest calls, again to build strength in numbers. One of the elm trees is dominated by cassinii, the cicada species that produces the juddering electrical circuit noise that, when up close, sounds like the clicking of a million tiny castanets. But amid the heaving mass of bodies there is also a stray septendecim, a different type of cicada that makes a more ethereal “woo-hoo” call.We hunt for the stray noise until Raupp finds the caller and squeezes him gently between thumb and forefinger, causing the cicada to let out a squeak similar to the sound of shoes on a basketball court. Visible on the cicada is its tymbal, a membrane on the drum-like abdomen that is vibrated to make its distinctive noise. “The males are singing their brains out to bring as many people to the party as they can,” said Raupp, as he looked at the rogue septendecim. “But if you want to hook up, you better be in the right bar.”If a female takes a shine to a male’s call, she will flick her wings to signal mating can occur. Females will then cut a slit into a branch to deposit a clutch of 20 to 30 eggs via their ovipositors, a tubular egg-laying organ. Once hatched, these nymphs will then drop to the soil to bury themselves to begin the next stanza in the cicadas’ story.But even the carnal stage is fraught with danger. We spot one cicada slowly ambling up the tree trunk with a noticeably white rear end – a sign it has been infected by a psychedelic fungus called Massospora, which produces an amphetamine in the insects that causes their bottoms to fall off before they mate uncontrollably with both male and female cicadas, spreading the fungus further.Left: The sturdy creatures sport wings and orange eyes. Right: The amber-colored exoskeletons shed by the cicadas litter the ground.Left: The sturdy creatures sport wings and orange eyes.

Photograph: Gabriella Demczuk/The GuardianRaupp, who is wearing a T-shirt with a giant cicada emblazoned upon it, is a vocal proponent of the species, once seasoning a few cicadas, placing them on a skewer and smuggling them into his carry-on baggage in order to travel to California and appear on Jay Leno’s late night talkshow. The host gamely ate the crunchy delicacy but Russell Crowe, a guest on the TV show, demurred. “He whispered to me ‘there’s no way I’m eating that, mate’,” Raupp recalled. “I like them, they’ve got a nutty sort of flavor. Leno said they tasted better than Cheetos.”Many people share Crowe’s antipathy, however. Raupp said a friend quizzed him on when the cicadas were emerging so that he could book a lengthy holiday to Idaho to escape their arrival. A woman in Ohio has created a body shield made of shower curtains to avoid any contact with them. Police in Georgia have begged people to stop calling 911 to report the loud noise the cicadas make. A CNN newsreader, reporting how a Maryland company was selling cicadas dipped in chocolate, broke off to admit “I’m so sick to my stomach reading this.”This reaction can be understandable when dealing with a creature measuring two inches long that resembles a cockroach with the startling addition of orange eyes. “They don’t bite or sting you, there’s nothing to fear from them,” said Raupp, as a cadre of cicadas crawled up his leg. “But some people are phobic and I take that seriously. To have thousands of cicadas emerge at once around you can be traumatic.”The cicadas would have more well-founded fears of us, however. The insects typically wait for soils to reach 64F to emerge, a level of warmth that is arriving several weeks earlier in the year than it was in the 1970s due to global heating, climate scientists have said. Their range is also edging northwards as their environment heats up, pushing them to an unknown fate.The rapid development of their habitat, meanwhile, has already wiped out several broods in the US. Even if all of these risks are avoided, cicadas’ stars are destined to burn brightly but quickly – once free from their 17-year dormancy, they will all be dead within a month once their reproductive goals are met.“It’s a changing planet and it will affect cicadas like everything else,” said Raupp. “But their lineage goes back several million years and perhaps they will adapt. They really are amazing things.”",2019-09-21
 Iguanas with chips: Florida seeks solution to invasive reptile problem,‘Tag day’ initiative opposed by some owners of exotic petsState official ‘proud that Florida is looked at as a leader’,"['Richard Luscombe', ' in Miami', '@richlusc']","From Key West’s high-summer Hemingway Days, in which bearded hopefuls vie for the title of best Papa lookalike, to the annual hunt for the elusive (and imaginary) skunk ape, Florida is renowned for its calendar of curiosities.Toilet-invading iguanas among invasive species now banned in FloridaRead moreNow another bizarre date has been added to the list: tag your reptile day.Owners of tegus, a non-native species of giant central and south American lizard, and green iguanas, another prolific invader, must get their reptiles microchipped like any conventional pet.Seeking compliance with a regulation passed in February to protect against invasive species and which came into effect this weekend, the Florida fish and wildlife commission (FWC) has established tag day, actually a series of dates in the coming weeks at venues around the state.“Just as with cats and dogs, microchipping your green iguana or tegu is one of the simplest and most effective ways to keep them safe while also protecting Florida’s native wildlife,” said Kristen Sommers, FWC head of wildlife impacts management.The microchipping days, sure to raise eyebrows in the waiting rooms of veterinarians’ offices, are part of a 90-day grace period. After that, tegus and green iguanas must be permitted and chipped.A further three-month period will allow owners time to comply with new requirements for outdoor caging, which also apply to the other 14 non-native species covered by the new regulation, including Burmese and other species of pythons, green anacondas and Nile monitors.“These animals are creating enormous issues for our state,” said the FWC chairman, Rodney Barreto, of regulations meant to reduce the release of nuisance species into the wild.“I have always been proud that Florida is looked at as a leader. Let’s take a bold stance. We have to put our foot down. The time has come, and we hope other states will follow.”Florida has about 500 non-native species, many of which have caused massive damage to a sensitive ecosystem. Among the worst offenders are Burmese pythons, which have run rampant in the Everglades and other waterways, depleting stocks of deer, rodents and wading birds.A woman holds an Argentine black and white tegu. Photograph: Mladen Antonov/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Argentinian black and white tegu, which can grow to the size of a dog, has become problematic particularly in the south of the state. Since 2012, at least 7,800 have been found dead or removed from the wild by FWC staff or hunters.Green iguanas can grow to more than 5ft and weigh up to 17lb. According to the FWC, they cause damage by digging burrows that erode and collapse sidewalks, foundations, seawalls, berms and canal banks.The agency encourages the humane killing and removal of both species in the wild.Some who keep the creatures as pets are not so welcoming of the new regulations.“This is absolutely ridiculous,” one owner, Marie Lewis, posted on the Hernando Reptile and Exotics Rescue Facebook page. “We are all being punished for idiot caretakers. I understand the possibility of invasive species but some of us actually care for our reptiles.”",2020-01-27
 Push for post-Brexit trade deals may threaten UK pledges on deforestation,Government criticised over ‘indefensible’ proposal that could undermine climate efforts while yielding benefit of only £1.38m,"['Fiona Harvey', ' Environment correspondent']","The UK government may be undermining its commitments to end deforestation overseas because of conflicts over trade policy, the Guardian has learned.A war of words is raging within the government over deforestation and trade, with green campaigners warning that a proposed policy could have dire consequences for efforts to stop illegal logging.Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the international trade secretary, is believed to want to relax tariffs for goods including palm oil from Malaysia, a country of top concern over deforestation. The relaxation would be part of a broader push for trade deals with developing countries that the government is pursuing in the wake of Brexit.The UK wants to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), which includes Malaysia, by dropping generic trade tariffs. Negotiations began under the former trade secretary Liz Truss, who is running as a Tory leadership candidate.However, the removal of tariffs without any green strings attached would undercut the UK’s parallel efforts to end illegal deforestation overseas, one of the centrepieces of the deal that ministers forged at the UN Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow last year.Sam Lawson, the director of the UK campaign group Earthsight, who has spent many years investigating deforestation for palm oil in Malaysia, said: “This proposal to slash tariffs on Malaysian palm oil without any conditions regarding the devastating deforestation those imports are known to cause is utter madness. Instead of addressing the cost of living crisis, this government is using it as a hollow excuse for ditching its own climate goals in a craven effort to get another trade agreement under its belt.”The UK’s Environment Act, which was passed last year, makes provision for due diligence when companies import goods, including palm oil, from overseas countries where deforestation is rife. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is currently consulting on the exact form this due diligence will take in practice.Fury as government waters down post-Brexit food standardsRead moreIf import regulations are relaxed for Malaysia without due diligence safeguards in place, it could give countries where deforestation is happening the hope of avoiding any of the sanctions provided for in the Environment Act, rendering the government’s green pledges toothless. Countries such as Indonesia and Brazil would be likely to press for similar deals, according to campaigners.The Guardian has seen a strongly worded letter to Trevelyan from Zac Goldsmith, an environment minister and member of the House of Lords, querying her stance. He cited research showing that liberalising trade in the way the Department for International Trade (DIT) is considering for Malaysia would yield an economic benefit of only about £1.38m for the whole of the UK.“If we go for the full liberalisation, we are choosing to U-turn on the very core of our Cop26 messaging on the importance of forests,” he wrote. “We obviously cannot continue leading global efforts to break the link between commodities and deforestation if in our own trade policy we are encouraging the opposite.”In the letter, dated 28 June, he added: “It is clear this isn’t an authentic ‘cost of living’ decision; it is a values decision. And I am struggling to understand who we are trying to appeal to with these appalling values? Or how we are supposed to defend this entirely indefensible position, for example in Lib Dem target seats?”Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BSTThe DIT said it could not comment on live negotiations. A spokesperson told the Guardian: “We are firmly committed to maintaining our high domestic standards of environmental protection in trade agreements, and CPTPP includes environmental provisions to support these objectives. The UK has convened over 25 major trading countries to agree action to protect forests through the forest, agriculture and commodity trade dialogue, and is taking forward measures under the Environment Act to make it illegal for businesses to use key commodities if they have not been produced in line with local laws protecting forests and other natural ecosystems.”The production of palm oil, which is widely used in an array of supermarket goods, from cosmetics to bread, is a major cause of deforestation in many countries in south-east Asia. Attempts to encourage more sustainable production of palm oil have so far made little progress.Lawson said: “UK consumers don’t want to be associated with destroying orangutan habitat or human rights abuses overseas. The giant agricultural firms and supermarket chains involved in the trade in goods from Malaysia can easily absorb the tiny cost of ensuring this out of their own profits.”Current UK tariffs for Malaysian palm oil vary from 2% for crude palm oil to 12% for the more processed versions.",2022-07-19

","['Katharine Murphy', ' and ', 'Adam Morton']","A majority of Australians are worried about the threat posed by global heating and want serious action to address it, but Queenslanders are less concerned than people in other states, according to the latest Climate of the Nation report.The authoritative annual survey of 2,626 voters – now in its 14th year and managed by the progressive thinktank the Australia Institute – suggests three-quarters are worried about the climate crisis, the largest proportion in its history.As cabinet meets on Wednesday to consider a new climate roadmap the prime minister, Scott Morrison, wants to unveil before the Cop26 talks in Glasgow, the poll suggests a clear majority – 69% – want the Morrison government to put Australia on a path to net zero emissions. The same proportion wants the Coalition to do more to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles.US climate push on Australia and allies aims to ramp up pressure on China, ambassador saysRead moreBut the survey data suggests Queenslanders are less perturbed about the risks posed by the climate crisis than other Australians, with 69% saying they are concerned, compared with the national average of 75%.Queenslanders are also less likely to say Australia should be a world leader in looking for solutions than people in other states (63% of Queenslanders agree, compared with the national average of 67%).Morrison is attempting to persuade the National party to sign on to a net zero target before the United Nations-led climate conference in November. Liberals are optimistic agreement with the junior Coalition partner can be reached but a number of Queensland Nationals oppose the shift.While the Climate of the Nation data suggests attitudes in Queensland are different to other states, it also suggests public perceptions are on the move.Half the Queenslanders in the sample now support a moratorium on coalmining, which is a three-point increase from 2020. A significant majority also agrees that Australia needs environmental protections (71% agreed in 2021, up from 68% in 2020).Agreement among Queenslanders in the sample that coalmining has a strong economic future declined by eight points over the past 12 months (37% of respondents agree with that proposition now compared with 45% last year).But Australian voters continue to think fossil fuel industries employ more people and generate more national income than they actually do.The frenetic fan dance of the fools tells us the Coalition has reached crunch time on climate | Katharine MurphyRead moreWith trenchant opponents of climate action declaring Australia should not cripple traditional industries with ambitious emissions reduction targets – an attack line a number of Queensland Nationals use regularly – the latest survey shows Australians overestimate the size of gas industry employment by a factor of 46.Voters estimate that on average 9.2% of the workforce is engaged in oil and gas extraction when the reality is those industries represent only 0.2% of the Australian workforce.But a clear majority say they support the reliance on fossil fuels ending. The poll suggests 82% support the phasing out of coal-fired power stations.The Nationals leader, Barnaby Joyce, told the ABC on Tuesday night that a deal with the Liberals on net zero was not yet done.The deputy prime minister contended that regional Australians had been “done over” during previous international climate commitment periods because “people played a sneaky little game, and we ended up with the divestment of our private property”.Joyce said the Nationals wanted complete clarity on the economic assumptions guiding the shift Morrison was proposing.Climate 200 raises $2m in six weeks to help independents but expects Liberal party ‘interference’Read moreThe Nationals frontbenchers Bridget McKenzie, David Littleproud and Keith Pitt were briefed for the first time on Monday afternoon on the roadmap that has been worked up by the energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, with input from across the government. Joyce was in Monday’s briefing.Taylor was asked by Nationals to provide more detail about the economic analysis underpinning the new proposed roadmap for Wednesday’s cabinet deliberation. Some insiders insist the negotiation has a long way to go, and internal perceptions vary about the level of base support inside the Nationals for a climate policy pivot.The new Climate of the Nation survey will be launched on Wednesday by the shadow climate change minister, Chris Bowen. Bowen argues strong support for climate action in the data indicates “the needle has shifted in the public debate around climate change”.“It’s a global race to become a renewable energy superpower – it is clear Australians are on board – it’s past time for the government to join them,” Bowen said.The new survey and the cabinet deliberation comes as the Liberal senator Andrew Bragg will use a speech to the Investor Group on Climate Change to advocate for carbon neutrality by mid-century, declaring a “100% renewable energy future is within sight”.Bragg will argue schemes like Buy Now Pay Later have a role in driving the transition, and cite estimates showing that over the past year around 15% to 20% of all solar installations were financed by BNPL.

","['Adam Morton', ' Climate and environment editor']","The mountain mist frog, a species once found across two-thirds of Australia’s wet tropics, has been declared extinct on the International Union for Conservation of Nature red list.The last recorded sighting of the frog, most commonly found near Thornton Peak, north-west of Cairns, was in April 1990. It is believed to have been wiped out by chytrid fungus, a disease that attacks the skin and has destroyed amphibian populations across the globe, though a reduction in its natural habitat due to rising temperatures driven by greenhouse gas emissions may have also played a role.The species is listed as critically endangered by the Australian government, but was upgraded to extinct on the IUCN list. It was one of 26 Australian species to have its listing changed. Most of the others were types of orchid.Marine life hit by ‘perfect storm’ as red list reveals species close to extinctionRead moreDr Jodi Rowley, a frog biologist at the Australian Museum and the University of New South Wales, said the mountain mist frog was a “beautiful endemic rainforest species”, and one of several Australian frog species that had not been seen for decades but had not been declared extinct until now.“Many have dramatically declined and unfortunately this little guy seems to have disappeared,” Rowley said. “It is awfully sad. It has been searched for over the last 25 years so it is unlikely that it’s still out there.”

The mountain mist frog reached nearly 6cm in length and was described as grey, grey-brown or light brown, sometimes with black flecks or spots on its back.“For tens of thousands of years there were these little frogs that were calling their hearts out in these rainforests and now it’s silent,” she said. “We have a terrible track record on frog conservation in Australia.”But Rowley said it was important not to lose hope. There were about 40 frog species listed as threatened in Australian legislation and steps could be taken to help them, she said.There was also some positive news in the red list: the status of the Australasian bittern, a bird from the heron family, improved from endangered to vulnerable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the basements of what seven or eight years ago were shops, warehouses, and dwellings a waist-high tangle of willowherb, spear-plume thistle, and Oxford ragwort bore witness to the thoroughness with which nature reclaims the land as soon as man’s back is turned.

 Revealed: rightwing US lobbyists help craft slew of anti-protest fossil fuel bills,Legislation drafted by Alec part of backlash against Indigenous communities and environmentalists opposing oil and gas projects,"['Nina Lakhani', '@ninalakhani']","Republican-led legislatures have passed anti-protest laws drafted by an extreme-right corporate lobbying group in a third of all American states since 2018, as part of a backlash against Indigenous communities and environmentalists opposing fossil fuel projects, new research has found.The American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec) helped draft legislation criminalizing grassroots protests against pipelines, gas terminals and other oil and gas expansion projects in 24 states, under the guise of protecting critical infrastructure.Rightwing lobby group Alec driving laws to blacklist companies that boycott the oil industryRead moreAlec, which is funded by rightwing state lawmakers, corporate sponsors and trade groups, and wealthy ideologues, creates model legislation on a range of conservative issues such as gun control, abortion, education funding and environmental regulations.The laws were passed in 17 Republican-controlled states, including Oklahoma, North and South Dakota, Kansas, West Virginia and Indiana, where protesters now face up to 10 years in prison and million-dollar fines, according to a new report from the non-profit Climate Cabinet.The anti-protest bills, which were rolled out in response to the success of mostly Indigenous-led campaigns slowing down fossil-fuel infrastructure projects, have used intentionally vague language to create a chilling effect on free speech and assembly – both constitutionally protected rights, according to the report Critical Infrastructure Laws: A Threat to Protest & the Planet.“Indigenous-led demonstrations opposing fossil-fuel projects have been one of the most successful and effective forms of climate action to date … in an affront to the protected freedoms of our constitution, state legislatures have found a new legislative mechanism to oppress frontline communities and cause further harm and destruction to our planet,” said Jonathon Borja, co-author of the report.The first so-called critical infrastructure bills originated in Oklahoma in 2018, where the Republican state representative Scott Biggs referenced North Dakota’s Dakota Access pipeline (DAPL) protests and acknowledged that some anti-pipeline demonstrations had succeeded. “[The bill] is a preventative measure … to make sure that doesn’t happen here.”Other states followed after Alec created a model bill for lawmakers to copy. So far, the bills have not passed in any states where Democrats hold a majority in at least one legislative chamber, though some Democrats have voted in favor of them.In most of the bills, protesters, like those who participated in the DAPL demonstrations, could now face felony charges, while those charged with “aiding” protests could face harsh fines.Fossil fuel expansion projects halted by Indigenous-led campaigns represent the carbon equivalent of 12% of annual US and Canadian pollution, or 779m metric tons of greenhouse gases, according to data gathered by the Indigenous Environmental Network and Oil Change International.The report comes as the White House and Congress negotiate the final terms of a controversial permitting side deal with the Democratic West Virginia senator Joe Manchin, which could make it harder to legally challenge new pipelines and other fossil fuel infrastructure.In a statement Alec said: “Alec has long been a leader in promoting and protecting free speech … But protests can and do turn violent. And when they do, our critical infrastructure facilities must be protected.”",2022-09-14
 Insulate Britain protesters praised by judge who fined them,Judge says environmental activists ‘inspired me personally’ after impassioned speeches in court,"['Tobi Thomas', '@tobithomas_']","Insulate Britain protesters have been praised by a judge, who said he was “inspired” by their commitment to greener living, as he fined 12 of them over a demonstration that disrupted the journeys of drivers on the M25.The protesters blocked traffic at junction 3 of the motorway. Some glued themselves to the tarmac, while another glued himself to a police car.Nine of the activists admitted charges in relation to the protest either by post or in person at Crawley magistrates court on Tuesday.Mary Adams, 68, Ian Bates, 63, Karen Matthews, 60, Margurite Doubleday, 67, Bethany Mogie, 39, Xavier Gonzalez-Trimmer, 21, and Lucy Crawford, 52, each pleaded guilty to wilful obstruction of free passage of the highwayBiff Whipster, a 54-year-old from Canterbury, admitted criminal damage by leaving a “hard, crusty layer of glue” on the window of a police vehicle during the demonstration.Bates, Matthews and Whipster were told by Stephen Leake, the district judge, that they had “inspired” him after making impassioned speeches about their concerns over the climate while representing themselves in court.Leake said: “They have inspired me and personally I intend to do what I can to reduce my own impact on the planet, so to that extent your voices are certainly heard,” while adding: “I have heard your voices.”Despite saying their actions were inspiring, Leake added that his role was to “apply the law” and said their actions had caused “significant disruption” to the motorway. “These are difficult cases for us judges because we have to apply the law and that is what we have sworn our judicial oaths to do.”The court heard that the action caused disruption to an estimated 18,000 vehicles across the wider area, including an ambulance carrying a patient who “urgently needed to be transported”, according to evidence from National Highways.Protesters attending court on Monday, all of whom sat in the public gallery throughout the hearing, claimed they had exhausted all other means of campaigning over the climate crisis and resorted to “non-violent protest” to highlight their cause.Tissues were passed around by a member of court staff as several broke down in tears and held their faces in their hands while fellow activists voiced their fears over a “desperate” environmental situation.The judge said the protesters had “no doubt” been acting in a way they believed was “morally right” but had still committed a criminal offence.The 12 protesters received fines that ranged between £120 and £400.Another three protesters, Victoria Lindsell and Michelle Charlesworth, who were each accused of one count of wilful obstruction, and Louis McKechnie, who was charged with criminal damage, had their hearings adjourned until 28 April at Crawley magistrates court.",2022-04-13
‘Betting on a low-carbon future’: why China is ending foreign coal investment,Xi Jinping’s promise reflects growing awareness of the climate crisis in China and falling renewable prices,['Vincent Ni'],"The pledge by China’s president, Xi Jinping, on Tuesday to cease building new coal-fired power projects outside the country will be welcome news to environmentalists around the world. It came on the anniversary of Xi’s unilateral pledge for China to reach carbon neutrality by 2060. Last year Xi also promised that Chinese emissions would peak by 2030.“China will step up support for other developing countries in developing green and low-carbon energy, and will not build new coal-fired power projects abroad,” Xi said in a pre-recorded video address at the annual UN general assembly.Xi is personally invested in the climate agenda. Since he came to power in 2012, Beijing has been taking more visible steps in tackling its own environmental problems such as pollution. It has been extending its influence abroad, too, by joining international initiatives such as the 2015 Paris climate agreement – a pledge that Donald Trump pulled the US out of four years ago but which Joe Biden has rejoined. And unlike in some countries, there is consensus among China’s political elite that the climate crisis is real.‘What can we do?’ Chinese discuss role of climate crisis in deadly floodsRead moreInside China there has been growing awareness among citizens about the impact of the climate crisis. This summer’s devastating floods in Henan province illustrated to many people the consequences of inaction on the climate emergency. Jia Xiaolong, the deputy head of the national climate centre, told China News Agency that the heavy rainfall in Henan occurred “against the backdrop of global warming”.Xi’s announcement comes at a time when China’s relationship with western countries continues to deteriorate. Last week the US, the UK and Australia introduced a trilateral security partnership, nicknamed Aukus, which most analysts say has the aim of keeping China in check. In the meantime there have been questions over whether Xi will personally attend the Cop26 meeting in Glasgow in November.Sam Geall, the chief executive of China Dialogue, an environmental thinktank, said: “[Xi’s pledge at the UN] means China remains committed to climate action ahead of Cop26, even when geopolitical tensions are rising in other arenas – because China sees climate action as being in its national self-interest, in terms of technology leadership, political economy and, no doubt, soft power.“It also sends a message to the global south, that China is betting on a low-carbon future and China aims to be leading supplier and financier for developing countries of those clean technologies and infrastructures.”MapThere’s little doubt about how significant China’s promise to stop funding overseas coal-fired power projects is. Until recently, China, Japan and South Korea accounted for more than 95% of all foreign financing for coal-fired power plants, according to Georgetown University. Japan and South Korea promised to cease such operations early this year.China’s Lehman Brothers moment?: Evergrande crisis rattles economyRead moreBut the slew of promises from the trio in recent months is “low-hanging fruit”, according to Geall. The falling price of renewables in recent months means the economic case for coal is worse than ever. Few countries want to be lumbered with new coal fleets. “China will, of course, need to go further in curbing its domestic coal production and consumption – which it has room to do under its 14th five-year plan and as part of the 2060 goal,” he said.Dr Thomas Hale, of the University of Oxford’s Blavatnik School of Government, agreed. He said coal remained very much alive within China, which is the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter. After Xi’s pledge, all eyes would focus on China’s domestic plans. “Ultimately, the single most important question for the future of life on planet Earth is how quickly China can shut its thousands of coal facilities,” he said.But China’s historical reliance on coal is driven by the need to keep economic activity going. Ultimately, how China is to reduce its coal dependency will be determined by the transition of the economy itself. It is what Beijing has promised to do, but it is proving to be a difficult task. China’s provincial governments approved the construction of 24 new coal power projects in the first half of 2021, including three large-scale power plants, according to Greenpeace, although that represented a decline on numbers approved in 2020.While international commentaries have been heavily focused on the economic ramification of the potential collapse of Evergrande, China’s second largest property developer, in recent weeks, Hale thinks this crisis may ultimately be of more significance to the climate.“If that building crisis helps push the Chinese economy away from a debt-fuelled growth model, it could be the biggest climate development of the year. If instead it shows just how deeply that model is entrenched in China’s political economy, then we will need to treat China’s climate ambitions with greater scepticism,” he said.",2021-09-23
A&E for trees: pioneering clinic in India provides lifeline for poorly plants,An on-call team at Amritsar’s tree hospital nurses sick neems and gives new life to troubled banyans,"['The age of extinction is supported by', 'About this content', 'Neeta Lal']","Sahib Singh clambers up a portable ladder, reaches out and, with the help of a few tools, tugs at the banyan tree and successfully removes it. The uprooted plant, which had sprouted from a wall inside the living room, is placed in a plastic bag filled with fertilised black soil. “We will replant this on the hospital lawn,” Singh says over Skype, while climbing back down the ladder. The operation lasts barely 20 minutes.The removal of the banyan tree, considered sacred in Hinduism, is the first of three calls attended by Singh in his tree ambulance on one day in May. He is a gardener and part of the team at the Pushpa Tree and Plant Hospital and Dispensary, in the northern Indian city of Amritsar, launched in January 2020.The hospital’s team of botanists, forestry experts, gardeners, volunteers and tree surgeons provide free services to people who need help protecting the city’s biodiversity. They replant uprooted trees, take care of the dying ones and ward off insect attacks from the fields. Sometimes, the trees are transplanted to more suitable locations.When our lives are endangered, ambulances ferry us to hospital. What about plants that are critical to our planet’s survival?Rohit Mehra“We provide about 33 kinds of plant-related services to people who call our helpline,” says Rohit Mehra, a civil servant and the brains behind the hospital. “When our lives are endangered, we have ambulances to ferry us to hospital, but what about plants that are so critical to our planet’s survival?”The hospital owns three tree ambulances – electric rickshaws that have been repurposed and stocked with gardening tools, a portable ladder and an array of plant medicines, fertilisers and growth tonics kept in neat plastic containers.Rohit Mehra, second from right, and his team with some of the lotions and potions administered to sickly trees in Amritsar.

Neem oil mixed with water in a 70-30 ratio makes for an excellent insecticide, as well as a tonic for plants.”The hospital also refers to ancient textbooks such as the Vriksha Ayurveda, Panchratna and Vastu Shastra, which include recipes for plant medicines, and has compiled a manual on plant care. “Termite attacks are addressed by filling a mud pot with jaggery and burying it in the fields after covering its lid. After 15 days, all the insects find their way into the pot and the field becomes termite free. You simply have to remove the pot,” says Geetanjali.Volunteer Ram Sevak loads up one of the hospital’s three rickshaws repurposed as ‘tree ambulances’. Photograph: Neeta Lal/HandoutCalls to the helpline are registered and attended to by the ambulance team, which includes a gardener, volunteer and biodiversity expert. For larger operations, more people are called into service. Three to four calls in neighbouring areas are answered in a day.Singh’s next stop is at the home of a resident with a cluster of neem trees which appear to be dying. Singh begins by carefully inspecting each tree. He then scratches their gnarly bark to take a closer look before bending down to examine the soil below.After 15 minutes, the problem is diagnosed. “The trees have been poisoned,” Singh announces gravely. He summons his assistant to dig up the earth around the trees and remove it. Ten sacks of fresh soil mixed with herbs and fertilisers are brought in from the ambulance and poured around the trees. “The trees will be fine in a fortnight,” Singh says. There is a collective sigh of relief from the family congregated on the lawn. “The trees were planted by my father, who is no more, so they have sentimental value for all of us,” says the owner.The next call is a five-minute drive away, where a six-year-old fruit-bearing apricot tree has been partly uprooted because of a dust storm the previous night. As the tree is gargantuan, extra help is required to lift and reset it.Volunteer Ram Sevak calls the hospital for reinforcements. Within 15 minutes, three men arrive and, after a 90-minute struggle, the job is accomplished; Singh and his assistant manage to bed the tree firmly in the soil with the help of shovels and spades. As they mop their sweaty brows, a round of applause breaks out. Finally, they fortify the soil with a herbal mixture and spray it with a solution of neem oil and water.How to spot bark beetles and deadly fungus: the UK’s new tree-saving lab needs your helpRead more“It’ll be fine; just take care that there is no insect infestation around it by spraying this herbal insecticide daily,” the gardener advises, handing the homeowner three bottles of a brown pesticide.

 UK startup Octopus Energy becomes renewable energy giant in £3bn deal ,Plan to create 50 million customers after takeover of Octopus Renewables hands UK supplier 300 projects in six countries ,['Jillian Ambrose'],"The UK’s fastest growing energy supplier will soon become one of Europe’s biggest renewable energy investors in a deal worth more than £3bn, which could bring green energy to 50 million homes in six years.Octopus Energy will snap up its sister company Octopus Renewables in a move that will hand the startup a portfolio of about 300 renewable energy projects, across six different countries, enough to power more than 1.2 million homes.The fast-growing energy supplier hopes to grow its international business to create 50 million Octopus Energy customers by 2027, and plans to increase its new renewables division to generate as much clean electricity as it sells.Octopus Energy last year achieved double “unicorn status” – a term used to describe young startup companies worth at least $1bn –after investors valued the company at more than $2bn, just five years after it began supplying gas and electricity.Greg Jackson, the founder and chief executive of Octopus Energy, said the deal would create a business that was “unrivalled on the global stage” by combining the supplier’s unique technology platform with the investment expertise of Octopus Renewables. He said the deal could “change the entire energy lifecycle, make every green electron matter, and deliver the green energy transition faster and cheaper for everyone”.Boris Johnson visiting the Octopus Energy headquarters in London in October. Photograph: Leon Neal/APJackson, who owns a 7.4% stake in Octopus Energy, amassed a paper fortune of an estimated $155m (£115m) after the company’s £2bn valuation last year, making him one of the most successful green energy entrepreneurs in UK corporate history.Chris Hulatt, the co-founder of Octopus Group, which owns both companies, said there was “a huge opportunity” to “unleash pent-up capital that can help deliver the green energy transition faster than anyone ever imagined”.Octopus Renewables was founded 21 years ago and owns a string of wind and solar projects in the UK, including several rooftop solar assets in Manchester and Birmingham and windfarms in South Lanarkshire and Northamptonshire. Earlier this month Nest, the UK’s largest workplace pension scheme, which manages pensions for more than 10 million employees, chose Octopus Renewables to help invest an initial sum of £250m directly into onshore wind and solar energy projects after divesting from fossil fuels.Octopus Energy’s ambition to increase its customer base to 50 million homes globally, includes a plan to reach another 50 million homes through its bespoke software platform which it leases to other suppliers to help run their energy supply businesses.Octopus has struck deals with big utility companies in Australia and Japan to use the “elect-tech” software, which uses bespoke algorithms to make it easier to offer customers “smart” renewable energy tariffs that can integrate home batteries and electric vehicles to make using renewable power cheaper.The technology platform is already used in 17 million homes, including customers of E.ON and Good Energy which lease the technology to run their own businesses. Octopus Energy has also made inroads into the German and US markets.",2021-03-26
LettersTurn out the lights to save our moths,"Artificial light is endangering Britain’s moths, but reducing the risk is as easy as flicking a switch, writes Anna Levin",['Letters'],"Your article on the decline in Britain’s moths (Britain’s moths decline by a third in 50 years, study finds, 3 March) mentions light pollution as “possibly” an important factor. This risks underplaying the impact of artificial light on every stage of a moth’s life and every aspect of its world. Light is time in the natural world and the vital synchronising of migration, pollination, predation and reproduction all depend on the pattern of light and dark.While the report mentioned in your article says that as yet there is limited evidence of direct causation between artificial light at night and population changes in moths, it also says that there are direct effects throughout their life cycle. Light pollution disrupts moths’ hormones, breeding, navigation and feeding. It also increases risk of predation by bats, and affects the availability of their plant food sources.Of all the potential causes of moth decline, from intensive agriculture to climate change, light pollution is the simplest to address: switch the lights off! Keeping artificial light at night to a minimum can only help moths, the unsung heroes of biodiversity, and the rest of the living world that their lives are inextricably intertwined with - including us humans.Anna LevinCambridge",2018-12-29
" Chemical pollution killing off England’s riverflies, experts warn",Fears for river ecosystems as average number of species declines,"['Damien Gayle', '@damiengayle']","Chemical pollution is killing off the invertebrate species that are the basis of England’s river ecosystems, with experts raising the alarm over falling diversity of mayfly, caddisfly and stonefly species.A census of aquatic wildlife on 12 English rivers found that in the spring and summer 2021, the mean number of riverfly species detected had fallen. In autumn last year, an average of just 10 species were recorded in each sample, compared with 13 in 2016.The findings come as the government considers a new “chemicals strategy” to reduce chemical pollution as part of its 25-year environment plan. Green groups are calling on ministers to take a dozen key steps they say could ameliorate contamination – but particularly to tackle chemicals from agriculture.Stephanie Morren, the senior policy officer at the RSPB, said: “It is not acceptable that the pressure on rivers from chemical pollution is getting worse and impacting wildlife.“We are living in a nature crisis, and we urgently need [the] government to take action. Given that such a significant amount of water pollution is from agricultural sources, it is vital that farmers are supported to reduce their reliance on inputs such as pesticides.”Sarah Haynes, coordinator at the Pesticide Collaboration, said: “It often takes decades to realise the true harm of pesticides and other chemicals on our environment. Once the damage is done and a pesticide gets banned, a new chemical will enter the market … and so it goes. Enough is enough. As the movement for nature-friendly farming swells, the government needs a proper plan to reduce pesticide use and help revive our rivers.”Hail Mary! Statue’s trip down the Wye raises chicken pollution issueRead moreIn the UK, more than 4,100 invertebrate species spend at least part of their lifecycle in freshwater. “Riverflies play many vital roles in our freshwater environment. They help to break down and filter organic matter and provide a food source for fish, birds, and mammals. Their presence is the standard indicator of the health of the habitat they live in,” Craig Macadam, the conservation director at Buglife, said.Exposure to chemical pollutants causes a range of problems for these invertebrate communities, leading from arrested development all the way to death. The different tolerances of the various aquatic invertebrates can allow scientists to determine the scale of the chemical impact at a particular site.“Looking at this data has allowed us to determine if, and how, chemicals are impacting aquatic wildlife, and whether the problem is getting better or worse,” researchers said in a report published on Tuesday.The report used Species at Risk scores – which are calculated from the diversity and abundance of invertebrates present in a river – generated from the riverfly census.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

 Texas oil company charged in massive spill off southern California coast,Prosecutors say company repeatedly failed to act on alarms that alerted workers to pipeline rupture ,"['Gabrielle Canon', ' and agencies']","A Houston-based oil company and two subsidiaries have been charged over a massive oil spill off the coast of southern California in October that fouled waters and beaches and endangered wildlife.Prosecutors say the spill was caused in part by failing to properly act when alarms repeatedly alerted workers to a pipeline rupture.Amplify Energy and its companies that operate several oil rigs and a pipeline off Long Beach were charged by a federal grand jury with a single misdemeanor count of illegally discharging oil.Investigators believe the pipeline was weakened when a cargo ship’s anchor snagged it in high winds in January, months before it ultimately ruptured on 1 October, spilling up to 25,000 gallons (94,600 liters) of crude oil in the ocean.US prosecutors said the companies were negligent six ways, including failing to respond to eight leak detection system alarms over a 13-hour period that should have alerted them to the spill and would have minimized the damage. Instead, the pipeline was shut down after each alarm and then restarted, spewing more oil into the ocean.Amplify blamed the unnamed shipping company for displacing the pipeline and said workers on and offshore responded to what they believed were false alarms because the system wasn’t functioning properly. It was signaling a potential leak at the platform where no leak was occurring, the company said.The leak, in fact, was from a section of undersea pipe 4 miles (6.4km) away, Amplify said.“Had the crew known there was an actual oil spill in the water, they would have shut down the pipeline immediately,” the company said.Workers in protective suits clean the contaminated beach in Corona Del Mar after an oil spill off the southern California coast, on 7 October 2021. Photograph: Ringo HW Chiu/APThe spill came ashore at Huntington Beach and forced about a weeklong closure of the city’s beaches and others along the Orange county coast. Fishing in the affected area resumed only recently, after testing confirmed fish did not have unsafe levels of oil toxins. It also seeped into delicate wetlands that are critical habitats for migratory and shorebirds, and other endangered species. It is still unclear how much of a lasting impact the spill had on plants and animals, even after the black globs were cleared from the beaches.‘It is there pretty much forever’: Huntington Beach oil spill may permanently affect birdsRead moreIf convicted, the charge carries up to five years of probation for the corporation and fines that could total millions of dollars. Orange county supervisor Katrina Foley said the indictment validates residents who had detected the spill a day earlier and reported it.“It’s terrible that they basically lied to the community during the press briefings and caused people to believe that what they saw with their own eyes or smelled or knew was actually not true,” she said.Pipeline safety advocate Bill Caram said the indictment paints a picture of a reckless company.“I understand there are false positives on leak detection systems but this is our treasured coastline,” said Caram, director of the Bellingham, Washington-based Pipeline Safety Trust. “The fact that they kept hitting the snooze button and ignoring alarms, stopping and starting this pipeline and all the while leaking oil in the Pacific Ocean is reckless and egregious.”Prosecutors also found that the pipeline was understaffed and the crew was fatigued and insufficiently trained in the leak detection system.The indictment’s description of company personnel as fatigued pointed to a long-standing industry problem, said pipeline expert Ramanan Krishnamoorti with the University of Houston.“Fatigue and overworked staff is old and trite and inexcusable,” he said. “This has been demonstrated over and over again as being the single most important vulnerability.”",2021-12-20
Country diary: So much life is here when I am not,"Abernethy Forest, Cairngorms: My daytime walk through the woods is rich with crested tits and busy ants; by night the clientele changes entirely",['Amanda Thomson'],"I’m walking through the woods to a huge old granny pine that’s gnarled and twisted, its lower branches thicker than the old plantation pines around it. It’s a beautiful, steady presence. The woods feel lush and full of birdsong. Thick strands of new-growth heather poke up. In the afternoon sunshine the mosses glow and creep up and along the trees. There’s a lovely old Scots phrase, moss fa’en, to describe a fallen tree that’s now shrouded in green.Near the granny lies a deep chocolatey-brown peaty mire that often has hoof prints in it, and I’ve had a camera on it just to see what is there when I am not. It’s clear that deer visit this place quite regularly, sometimes singly but often in groups, and use it as a wallow. At night, they’re sometimes reduced to the vaguest of shadows, and mostly they’re quietly passing by and the camera captures the bright dots of their eyes as they cross the frame. Occasionally their eyes gleam like headlights as they face the camera. They might be in groups of seven or eight, perhaps more, and they’ll linger and tussle, hoof and splash around.‘Occasionally their eyes gleam like headlights as they face the camera.’ Photograph: Amanda ThomsonSometimes it looks like just hinds, at other times, perhaps at certain times of year, mixed groups, and the camera’s caught a huge stag wading into the middle of the mire and rolling around. More than once a badger has snuffled in the mosses and heather at the base of the pine where the camera was mounted, and I’ve caught a beady eye and the blurry stripe of its snout. The last time I was here I moved the camera to a new spot. When I check, I find that it’s caught a pine marten scrambling down a broken branch that hangs from tree to ground.I walk on, coming across a massive ants’ nest next to another granny pine. Ants are streaming up and down, making light work of navigating the thick scales, fissures and flecks of the bark. Somewhere above I hear a crestie (crested tit) with its soft call, almost a giggle. It’s always the way, I come for one thing, then am distracted by everything else going on. I swap the SD card and leave my camera there, wondering what it will capture next.

 Electricity needed to mine bitcoin is more than used by 'entire countries',Bitcoin mining – the process in which a bitcoin is awarded to a computer that solves a complex series of algorithm – is a deeply energy intensive process,['Lauren Aratani'],"It’s not just the value of bitcoin that has soared in the last year – so has the huge amount of energy it consumes.The cryptocurrency’s value has dipped recently after passing a high of $50,000 but the energy used to create it has continued to soar during its epic rise, climbing to the equivalent to the annual carbon footprint of Argentina, according to Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, a tool from researchers at Cambridge University that measures the currency’s energy use.Recent interest from major Wall Street institutions like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs probably culminated in the currency’s rise in value and an endorsement by Tesla’s Elon Musk helped drive its recent high as investors bet the cryptocurrency will become more widely embraced in the near future.interactiveWhile the recent fall has dented Musk’s fortune, bitcoin also poses a threat to the company’s mission toward a “zero-emission future” and poses serious questions for governments and corporations looking to curb their own carbon footprints.Bitcoin mining – the process in which a bitcoin is awarded to a computer that solves a complex series of algorithms – is a deeply energy-intensive process.“Mining” bitcoin involves solving complex math problems in order to create new bitcoins. Miners are rewarded in bitcoin.Earlier in bitcoin’s relatively short history – the currency was created in 2009 – one could mine bitcoin on an average computer. But the way bitcoin mining has been set up by its creator (or creators – no one really knows for sure who created it) is that there is a finite number of bitcoins that can be mined: 21m. The more bitcoin that is mined, the harder the algorithms that must be solved to get a bitcoin become.Now that over 18.5m bitcoin have been mined, the average computer can no longer mine bitcoins. Instead, mining now requires special computer equipment that can handle the intense processing power needed to get bitcoin today. And, of course, these special computers need a lot of electricity to run.The amount of electricity used to mine bitcoin “has historically been more than [electricity used by] entire countries, like Ireland”, said Benjamin Jones, a professor of economics at the University of New Mexico who has researched bitcoin’s environmental impact. “We’re talking about multiple terawatts, dozens of terawatts a year of electricity being used just for bitcoin … That’s a lot of electricity.”Proponents of bitcoin say that mining is increasingly being done with electricity from renewable sources as that type of energy becomes cheaper, and the energy used is far lower than that of other, more wasteful, uses of power. The energy wasted by plugged-in but inactive home devices in the US alone could power bitcoin mining for 1.8 years, according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index.But environmentalists say that mining is still a cause for concern particularly because miners will go wherever electricity is cheapest and that may mean places that use coal. According to Cambridge, China has the most bitcoin mining of any country by far. While the country has been slowly moving toward renewable energy, about two-thirds of its electricity comes from coal.Since there is no government body or organization that officially tracks where bitcoin is being mined and what type of electricity miners are using, there is no way of knowing whether miners are using electricity that is fueled by renewable energy or fossil fuels.Mining rigs can move from place to place depending on where energy is cheapest, which makes mining particularly hard to track.“The places where you mine [bitcoin] can be moved around and, in some cases, you don’t even know where they are,” said Camilo Mora, a professor of geography and environment at the University of Hawaii.Cambridge’s Centre for Alternative Finances estimates that bitcoin’s annualised electricity consumption hovers just above 115 terawatt-hours (TWh) while Digiconomist’s closely tracked index puts it closer to 80 TWh.A single transaction of bitcoin has the same carbon footprint as 680,000 Visa transactions or 51,210 hours of watching YouTube, according to the site.A paper from 2018 from the Oak Ridge Institute in Ohio found that one dollar’s worth of bitcoin took 17 megajoules of energy, more than double the amount of energy it took to mine one dollar’s worth of copper, gold and platinum. Another study from the UK published last year said that computer power required to mine Bitcoin quadrupled in 2019 compared with the year before, and that mining has had an influence in prices in some power and utility markets.Bitcoin’s advocates have made it clear that they believe any environmental costs that come with mining bitcoin are worth the broader impacts it could have on society.00:05:59Why Bitcoin is so bad for the planet – video explainer“Bitcoin would not be able to fulfill its role as a secure, global value transfer and storage system without being costly to maintain,” reads a defense against bitcoin criticism from Ria Bhutoria, director of research at Fidelity Digital Assets.“Computers and smartphones have much larger carbon footprints than typewriters and telegraphs. Sometimes a technology is so revolutionary and important for humanity that society accepts the tradeoffs,” wrote investor Tyler Winklevoss on Twitter.Some have pointed out that there does not have to be a tradeoff between cryptocurrency and the environment. The creators of ethereum, considered the second most popular type of cryptocurrency after bitcoin, have promised to change the currency’s algorithm to make its mining more environmentally friendly.Vitalik Buterin, the computer scientist who invited ethereum, told IEEE Spectrum that mining cryptocurrency can be “a huge waste of resources, even if you don’t believe that pollution and carbon dioxide are an issue”, Buterin said. “There are real consumers – real people – whose need for electricity is being displaced by this stuff.”Currently, ethereum’s mining works similarly to bitcoin where the most powerful computers have an edge in getting the most bitcoin as computers compete to complete a transaction first. Ethereum’s developers are working on changing that system so that miners enter a pool and are randomly selected to complete the transaction and receive an ether in return. This method, called “proof-of-stake”, guarantees that less electricity will be used to mine the currency.But with bitcoin still reigning as the top cryptocurrency and, with endorsements from established companies and investment banks, the currency’s environmental impact is only likely to grow.When it comes to electricity, “the computer doesn’t care. The computer is just getting the electricity to run, but where its electricity comes from makes a huge difference [for the environment],” said Mora.",2021-02-27
" The climate crisis requires a new culture and politics, not just new techPeter Sutoris",This moment calls for humility – we cannot innovate ourselves out of this mess,,"We are living through what scientists call the Anthropocene, a new geological age during which humans have become the dominant force shaping the natural environment. Many scientists date this new period to the post-second world war economic boom, the “great acceleration”. This rapid increase in our control over the Earth has brought us to the precipice of catastrophic climate change, triggered a mass extinction, disrupted our planet’s nitrogen cycles and acidified its oceans, among other things.Our society has come to believe that technology is the solution. Electricity from renewable sources, energy-efficient buildings, electric vehicles and hydrogen fuels are among the many innovations that we hope will play a decisive role in reducing emissions. Most of the mainstream climate-change models now assume some degree of “negative emissions” in the future, relying on large-scale carbon capture technology, despite the fact that it is far from ready to be implemented. And if all else fails, the story goes, we can geoengineer the Earth.But the problem with this narrative is that it focuses on the symptoms, not the causes of environmental decay. Even if the technologies on which we pin our hopes for the future deliver as expected and do not lead to much collateral damage – both of which are huge assumptions – they will not have fixed our mindsets. This is a crisis of culture and politics, not of science and technology. To believe that we can innovate and engineer ourselves out of this mess is to miss the key lesson of the Anthropocene – that dealing with planetary-scale processes calls for humility, not arrogance.Our civilisation is underpinned by extractivism, a belief that the Earth is ours to exploit, and the nonsensical idea of infinite growth within a finite territory. Material possessions as markers of achievement, a drive to consume for the sake of consumption, and blindness to the long-term consequences of our actions, have all become part of the culture of global capitalism. But there is nothing self-evident about these things, as indigenous peoples teach us.Many indigenous groups got to know their natural environments intimately and sustained themselves over millennia, often despite harsh conditions. They came to understand the limits of what these environments could support, and they grasped that caring for the environment was simultaneously an act of self-care. Pacific islanders would designate no-go areas of the ocean to avoid overfishing, while high-altitude farmers in the Andes would rely on terraces that reduced erosion to grow their crops. It is not a coincidence that as much as 80% of the world’s remaining biodiversity is located within territories inhabited by indigenous peoples.How we talk about the climate crisis is increasingly crucial to tackling it | Susanna RustinRead moreRebuilding our relationship with our planet does not mean abandoning the many achievements of our civilisation. Some of our technological innovations can help us treat the symptoms of the environmental multi-crisis. But addressing the causes means abandoning some of the assumptions on which our current society is built: infinite growth, the instrumentalisation of the natural environment and speciesism.What does this look like in practice? Changing the collective mindset of a civilisation calls for a shift in values. It means educating our children about humility and connectedness, rather than vanity and individuality. It means changing our relationship with consumption, breaking the spell of advertising, manufactured needs and status. It means political organising, generating demand for a politics that sees beyond the nation state, and beyond the lifespan of the currently living generations – Wales has already started, with its Wellbeing of Future Generations Act.The Covid-19 pandemic has shown just how fragile and myopic our civilisation is. While technology has played a huge role in finding a way out of the pandemic through the development of vaccines, it has also highlighted humanity’s limitations as our societies became paralysed in the face of forces of nature more powerful than ourselves. And our chaotic response showed that technological prowess is no substitute for good political leadership. We must face up to the harsh reality that for all its achievements, our civilisation is deeply flawed. It will take a reimagination of who we are to truly solve this crisis.

" Ban European flights and car use in cities to hurt Putin, report urges","Strong measures by Europe could quickly deprive Russia of oil and gas income worth billions, experts say

Russia-Ukraine war: latest updates
","['Helena Horton', ' Environment reporter']","Flights should be banned in continental Europe and car use banned in city centres to save energy and prevent Vladimir Putin profiting from fossil fuel sales, campaigners have said.It would be possible for Europe to quickly end its reliance on oil and gas from Russia by taking strong measures, according to a report by the climate adviser Mark Lynas, energy analyst Rauli Partanen, and energy and sustainability installations specialist Joris van Dorp.Policies include rationing, with everyone in Europe allowed the same minimum amount of energy to use, and limiting thermostats to 18C in winter.“The biggest problem is gas. In total last year Europe imported 155 billion cubic metres of gas from Russia,” the authors said. Critics of the EU’s oil and gas policy have pointed out that hydrocarbon sales are financing the war in Ukraine.Even the EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said recently: “We’ve given Ukraine nearly €1bn. That might seem like a lot but €1bn is what we’re paying Putin every day for the energy he provides us with. Since the start of the war, we’ve given him €35bn [£29bn], compared to the €1bn we’ve given Ukraine to arm itself.”00:00:49€1bn for Ukraine, €35bn for Russia: top EU diplomat calls out funding gap – videoThe report’s authors said: “We conclude it is possible to eliminate Russian gas imports starting immediately in Europe. This will require an unprecedented level of European solidarity, a combination of a Marshall plan and a Berlin airlift to redistribute energy around the continent as needed and support the transition.”The International Energy Agency recently released a 10-point plan to reduce demand for oil use in member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with suggestions including subsidised public transport, lower speed limits and a reduction in business flights. The authors of the latest report from the RePlanet Research Institute, however, say such measures would reduce demand by 2.7m barrels a day in advanced economies, still substantially less than Russian oil exports to Europe.Buying Russian gas and oil has funded Putin’s war, says top EU officialRead moreThe authors argue that we need to go further, and say they have worked out how to eliminate 25% of all oil use in Europe.“We propose bans on all business flights, private jets and internal flights within Europe to save oil, and bans also on car use within cities,” they said. “This should be combined with free public transport. While the impacts of this are not easily quantified, we believe this could double the reduction in oil use beyond that proposed by the IEA.”To replace the gas Europe buys from Russia, the authors recommend measures including stopping the nuclear phaseout in Germany, Sweden and Belgium, reducing heating in buildings by 4C, and a fast-track deployment of additional solar and wind generation.These policies could be popular in Europe. New polling conducted by Savanta ComRes found that 41% of people polled in the UK, Germany Poland, France, Sweden and the Netherlands said they “strongly agreed” that their country should immediately stop buying Russian oil and gas. Only 6.4% strongly disagreed.Just over 40% said they would be prepared to accept energy rationing to manage demand, and 52.7% that they would eat less meat to reduce demand on Ukrainian exports.“Europe is sending over €500m every day directly to the Kremlin because we continue to import vast quantities of Russian oil, gas and coal. This situation cannot continue,” the authors of the report said.“It is morally and politically untenable for Europe to fund Putin’s war machine – paying for the same missiles and bombs that are raining down on Ukrainian schools and hospitals – at the same time as supposedly uniting to stop Putin through sanctions. There is only one solution. We must cut off this torrent of money we are sending to the Kremlin by immediately stopping our imports of Russian fossil fuels.”",2022-04-08

","['Donna Lu', '@donnadlu']","The world’s largest sand island formed around a million years ago and enabled the southern and central Great Barrier Reef to develop, new research suggests.An international team of scientists have dated K’gari (Fraser Island) and the nearby Cooloola Sand Mass in south-east Queensland as forming between 0.7m and 1.2m years ago.‘Fraser Island’ to be dropped in favour of Indigenous name K’gari under Queensland proposalRead moreTheir formation was “a necessary precondition for initiation of the southern and central Great Barrier Reef”, the researchers found.In geological terms, the world’s largest reef system developed relatively recently – an estimated 450,000 to 670,000 years ago.The study’s authors described this timing as a “conundrum”, because climatic conditions along the central and southern Queensland coastline have been ideal for reef growth since much earlier – between 2.6m years and 5.3m years ago, during the Pliocene epoch.Study co-author Prof Patrick Moss, head of the school of earth and environmental sciences at the University of Queensland, said there were two main theories for the formation of the Great Barrier Reef.

The first is temperature – “that basically from around 500,000 … [to] 700,000 years ago, there was a 4C increase in sea surface temperatures which allowed reef growth to occur,” Moss said.The second theory, which the K’gari study supports, is that clear waters were necessary.“Before K’gari and the other giant sand masses were formed, you had a lot more sand transport further north, and so that would produce murkier water and limit reef growth at that time,” Moss said.K’gari, a Unesco world heritage site, is the world’s largest sand island and also the end point of one of the world’s longest “longshore drift” coastal systems. Sand from the island originates as far as central New South Wales, travelling 1,500km north along the east coast of Australia.“The longshore drift process picks up sand grains and transports them to K’gari and along the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast,” Moss said. “That’s a really important aspect of creating south-east Queensland environment.”K’gari and the dune fields acted as a barrier to this longshore drift process, enabling reef growth, the study’s authors suggest.The researchers dated the age of the dunes on K’gari using two techniques: optically stimulated luminescence and palaeomagnetic dating.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

AnalysisWeather tracker: Anchorage on course for its snowiest November everLauren Herdman and Morgan Thomas (Metdesk),"Alaska’s largest city breaks several daily snowfall records, with snowstorms prompting state of emergency",,"Parts of Alaska have experienced considerable snowfall this autumn, with the state’s largest city on track to surpass its November record by some margin.The city of Anchorage, which typically receives about 5 inches (12cm) of snow during the first two weeks of November, has so far had an impressive 37.9 inches. Several daily records have been broken, most starkly on 8 November, with 9 inches of snow within 24 hours. That was part of a larger three-day snowstorm that brought more than 20 inches in total. A state of emergency was declared in the city during this event, prompting the closure of schools, suspension of public transport, and increased efforts to find shelter for the homeless population, with four deaths reported among people living outdoors.With half the month still to go and another large snowfall event forecast for early next week, Anchorage’s record for November – 38.8 inches in 1994 – is expected to topple. November 2023 will end as one of Anchorage’s snowiest months of all time, with the top spot held by February 1996, which saw 52.1 inches. Anchorage typically receives about 77 inches for winter as a whole, with the all-time record of 134.5 inches set during the winter season of 2011-12.In the South Pacific, Fiji was affected by Severe Tropical Cyclone Mal this week, which passed to the south-west of the islands on Wednesday and Thursday. The cyclone was equivalent in strength to a category 1 hurricane, with gusts of almost 100mph near the centre of the storm. Fiji closed many schools, and some homes were evacuated, but despite strong winds and heavy rainfall, the storm passed by with enough distance to prevent significant damage. Mal then continued southward, weakening to an extra tropical cyclone.Another tropical cyclone is expected to develop on Friday, this time in the Bay of Bengal. At the time of writing, the tropical depression was moving northwards towards Bangladesh, and was expected to intensify into a tropical cyclone before making landfall on Friday. If the storm does reach cyclone status, it will be called Midhili, a name proposed by the Maldives. The expected cyclone is forecast to produce 50-60mph gusts, with 100-150mm of rainfall possible for south-western parts of Bangladesh.",2023-11-17
 This article is more than 3 months oldMore aid money spent on clean air than fossil fuels for first timeThis article is more than 3 months old,"Clean Air Fund says despite increased spending on air pollution, projects still receive less than 1% of funding",['Ajit Niranjan'],"Governments, agencies and development banks have spent more aid money on clean air than fossil fuels for the first time on record, a report has found.However, such projects still receive less than 1% of international development funding, according to the Clean Air Fund, an environmental charity.Toxic particles in the air are the fourth-biggest killer globally, but campaigners say efforts to get rid of them have been “chronically” starved of cash. Only blood pressure, smoking and diet play a bigger role in whether people die too early.Jane Burston, the executive director of the Clean Air Fund, said cleaning the air saves lives, grows economies and slows the climate crisis, adding: “It’s the single thing that has the biggest bang for your buck if you fund it.”The report found that international aid for fossil fuels peaked in 2019 and has fallen fast but still lingers. In 2021, about $1.5bn (£1.2bn) was spent on fossil fuel projects like building coal plants or gas pipelines, down from $11.9bn two years earlier. The amount spent on tackling outdoor air pollution has risen to $2.3bn.Despite this shift, spending targeted at clean air made up just 1% of international development funding and 2% of international public climate finance between 2015 and 2021, the report found.“The trend is good but the funding is increasing from a very low base,” said Burston. “It’s not increasing quickly enough,” she added.Nor has the money been spent in the places that need it most, the report found. Africa received 5% of air quality funding between 2017 and 2021, despite being home to five of the 10 countries with the highest levels of air pollution in the world. At the same time, five polluted Asian countries – China, the Philippines, Bangladesh, Mongolia and Pakistan – received 86% of the funding.Scientists are unsure just how many people are killed by dirty air each year but estimates of the death toll run into the millions just from air pollution caused by burning fossil fuels. Fertiliser from farms, road dust from car tyres and natural factors all add to the mortality burden.Outdoor air pollution, which was the focus of the Clean Air Fund report, caused 4.2m premature deaths in 2019, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).Most of the deaths happen in poor and middle-income countries. In countries across Africa and Asia, in which large parts of the population lack access to electricity, governments have struggled to afford clean sources of energy that are cheaper to run than fossil fuel plants but cost more upfront.Some countries have taken big steps to clean up their air. China declared a “war against pollution” in 2014 and has brought levels of fine particulates down 40% in a decade. As a result, residents of Beijing can expect to live four years longer on average, according to a report from the Air Quality Life Index of the University of Chicago in August.People in rich countries are also choking on dangerous levels of toxic pollutants. An investigation by the Guardian last week found 98% of people in Europe are breathing air clogged with so many pollutants it breaches WHO guidelines.Zorana Jovanovic Andersen, an epidemiologist at the University of Copenhagen and the chair of the environment committee at the European Respiratory Society, said: “The cost of inaction on air pollution to our health and our societies and economies is already too high and unacceptable. It is time to shift these costs from people and the health sector to those who produce pollution.”",2023-09-29
  100m highly polluting cars could appear on Europe’s roads after EU move,Exclusive: Efficiency recommendations of experts rejected in European Commission ‘Euro 7’ proposals,['Arthur Neslen'],"Almost 100m highly polluting cars could appear on Europe’s roads over the next decade after the European Commission moved to disown its own experts efficiency recommendations in a leaked proposal seen by the Guardian.About 70,000 premature deaths in 2018 were caused by road transport emissions, mostly nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM), and the commission had been expected to tighten pollution limits in the next “Euro 7” regulation, which takes effect in 2025.A “medium ambition” option which would save €136bn (£119bn) in net health and environmental costs was touted, based on recommendations by an EU consortium of experts called Clove.However, the draft Euro 7 regulation only proposes bringing diesel emissions into line with those for petrol cars in the existing Euro 6 law, while petrol standards would remain unchanged.Anna Krajinska, the vehicle emissions and air quality manager for the Transport & Environment (T&E) campaign group said that the commission had reached its “very own Dieselgate moment”.“The tearing up of its own expert group advice is a scandal and completely undermines the tightening of pollution standards for cars and vans,” she said. “The auto industry lobby has fiercely opposed Euro 7, using a variety of dirty tricks to influence decision-makers. Now the commission has caved into their demands. Carmakers’ profits are being prioritised over the health of millions of Europeans.”The auto industry lobbied the commission intensely in the run up to the draft regulation, with one Volkswagen official last year painting “a picture of horror” to EU officials of the effect that tough standards could have, according to Der Spiegel.“Women would have to be afraid [when] in dark garages in the future; accident victims would have to wait, trembling, for the ambulance; police officers might arrive too late at the scene of the crime. And all this, because cars would have to warm up their exhaust gas purification systems before they could be allowed to start … ” the German newspaper reported.A spokesperson for the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association said: “The industry is calling for an approach that is not only effective in terms of results, but that is cost-beneficial, while also addressing the huge challenges of meeting future CO2 targets. Vehicle manufacturers are going full-course ahead with the goal of carbon neutrality – it would be counter-productive to take away investments from this.”The Euro 7 emissions standard, due to be published on 9 November, had been planned for four years as a replacement to the Euro 6, which was set in 2014, before the Dieselgate scandal.Under the anticipated medium ambition option, NOx emission limits would have been cut from 60 to 30mg a km, with particulate matter limits falling from 4.5 to 2mg/km, based on new emissions technologies.The draft regulation, which is being considered by commissioners and could change, says that this option was proportionate, cost-efficient and “the most effective” for cutting air pollution.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Particulate matter emissions have also fallen by 28% for cars and vans, and 14% for lorries and buses.",2022-10-21
 Liz Truss appoints green Tory Chris Skidmore to lead net zero review,Former energy and climate minister will look for the quickest ways to reach the emissions target,['Helena Horton'],"Liz Truss has appointed the Conservative MP Chris Skidmore to lead a review of net zero, to find the most efficient and fastest ways to reach the climate target.The former energy and climate minister has been given until the end of the year to present his findings to the prime minister.Skidmore, who chairs the environment all-party parliamentary group, has been campaigning for his party to take the issue of net zero more seriously. He said: “I am delighted to have been invited by the PM to conduct the review. It’s essential government delivers net zero, and does so in a way that is pro-business and pro-growth. I’m looking forward to getting started.”He told the Guardian during his tour of north-west England to promote net zero: “As the former energy and climate minister who signed net zero by 2050 into law, I’ve been determined to show that net zero isn’t just about going green; it is essential for future economic growth. One of the reasons why I’m out on tour with the all-party environment group which I chair is to demonstrate how net zero is going to benefit the lives of people across every region.”He said the review would look at how to incentivise businesses to take up the green industrial revolution and increase growth. “There is a green industrial revolution happening across the country that Westminster is slow to wake up to. Businesses are just getting on with net zero. But further to government support, we need to go further in creating a supply-and-demand-side revolution in renewable and clean energy and energy efficiency measures.“That means looking again at how we can change and reform financial incentives, regulations, planning, and much more to help make going net zero even easier and unleashing a clean economic growth revolution.”During the leadership election campaign, Skidmore was part of a small group of Conservative MPs, including the Cop26 chair, Alok Sharma, and the environment minister Zac Goldsmith, who encouraged the candidates to sign up to the net zero pledge.Truss signed up at the time, and said she would look at how to put net zero into practice while encouraging economic growth.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Truss also made the former thinktank chief Matthew Sinclair, who has said global heating could bring benefits, her economic adviser.There has also been disquiet about Truss’s plans to end the moratorium on fracking, as it could signal a wish to appease the more climate-sceptic right of her party by focusing on fossil fuel expansion over measures such as renewables and insulation.She ruled out a windfall tax to help with energy bills, at her first prime minister’s questions against Keir Starmer, adding: “I believe it is the wrong thing to be putting companies off investing in the United Kingdom, just when we need to be growing the economy.”",2022-09-08
" This article is more than 1 month old‘I’ve never seen anything like this’: Japan says reason behind 1,200 tonnes of fish washing ashore is unknownThis article is more than 1 month old",The sardines and mackerel were found floating on the surface of the sea near the fishing port of Hakodate in Hokkaido,"['Justin McCurry', ' in Tokyo']","Officials in Japan have admitted they are struggling to determine why hundreds of tonnes of fish have washed ashore in recent days.Earlier this month, an estimated 1,200 tonnes of sardines and mackerel were found floating on the surface of the sea off the fishing port of Hakodate in Hokkaido, forming a silver blanket stretching for more than a kilometre.Japan zoo investigates possible mass squirrel poisoningRead moreOn Wednesday, officials in Nakiri, a town on the Pacific coast hundreds of miles south of Hokkaido, were confronted with 30 to 40 tonnes of Japanese scaled sardines, or sappa, which had been observed in the area a couple of days earlier.Local fishers scrambled to collect the fish, fearing their carcasses would lower the oxygen content of the water as they decompose and damage the marine environment.“I’ve never seen anything like this before,” a fisher who has worked in the area for 25 years told the Mainichi Shimbun. “It was only around last year that we began to catch sappa in Nakiri. It makes me wonder if the marine ecosystem is changing.”Experts have speculated that the migratory fish in both areas had become stranded after being chased to the point of exhaustion by amberjack and other predatory fish. Mass mortality events can also occur when there are sudden drops in the water temperature, causing the fish to go into shock, they added.But no one has been able to confirm the cause. “The cause is unknown at the moment,” Mikine Fujiwara, a local fisheries official, told the newspaper. “We plan to sample the seawater at the site and examine it to uncover the cause.”Japanese government officials have blasted a report in the British newspaper the Daily Mail that appeared to link the phenomenon to the release of treated water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.Local authorities are urging people not to consume the fish. Photograph: 瀬尾遊/APThe report noted that dead fish had begun washing ashore almost four months after the plant began discharging the water – which contains small quantities of the radioactive isotope tritium – into the Pacific.The International Atomic Energy Agency approved the plan, stating in a safety review that discharging the water would have “a negligible radiological impact on people and the environment”.China, which opposed the release and imposed a ban on Japanese seafood, has been accused of hypocrisy since its own nuclear plants routinely pump wastewater with higher levels of tritium than that found in Fukushima’s discharge.“We are concerned about unsubstantiated information,” a Japanese fisheries agency official told the Asahi Shimbun.Images of the fish have been widely shared on social media – many accompanied by Fukushima conspiracy theories.“There have been no abnormalities found in the results of water-monitoring surveys,” the fisheries agency said, referring to the water that has been pumped out of the Fukushima plant so far. “We’re concerned about the proliferation of information that’s not based on scientific evidence.”Fishing cooperatives in Fukushima had warned that the discharge would inflict further damage on the reputation of their seafood.Town officials in Hakodate urged local people not to consume the stranded fish amid reports that some were gathering quantities to sell or eat. “We don’t know for sure under what circumstances these fish were washed up, so I don’t recommend eating them,” Takashi Fujioka, a fisheries researcher said.",2023-12-14
" Value of cryptocurrency bitcoin climbs 5% to record high of $63,000",Several digital currencies surge a day before launch of Coinbase trading platform on Wall Street,['Joanna Partridge'],"The value of the cryptocurrency bitcoin has surged to a record high, reaching $63,000 (£45,800).The cryptocurrency, which has risen in value by 450% in the last six months, continued to climb by a further 5% during trading on Tuesday.Bitcoin’s price has more than doubled since the start of 2021. The digital currency has been on a rollercoaster ride in the last year, and was trading at about only $7,000 in April 2020.The smaller, rival cryptocurrency Ethereum also rose on Tuesday, reaching its own record high of $2,205.The fresh records were set a day before the launch of the US’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase, on Wall Street’s tech-heavy Nasdaq stock exchange.Coinbase’s listing has been viewed by cryptocurrency fans as another sign of its growing mainstream acceptance among investors and financial institutions, and as a means of payment.The price of bitcoin soared towards $60,000 in February amid news of high-profile purchases of the digital currency, including by the electric car company Tesla, run by the billionaire Elon Musk. Tesla announced at the time it had bought $1.5bn in bitcoin and said it might soon accept payments in the currency.Musk, who briefly became the world’s richest man before a slump in the Tesla share price, has previously changed his Twitter biography to “#bitcoin”.Cryptocurrency trading is also enjoying a boom in Turkey, as investors seek refuge from the country’s economic turmoil and surging inflation.Turkey’s economic turmoil drives Bitcoin frenzyRead moreHowever, cryptocurrencies remain controversial, and global regulators including the Bank of England are sceptical, on account of their volatility and vulnerability to theft or hacking.Bitcoin and other digital currencies have also come under increasing fire for their environmental impact, given the huge amount of energy required to create them.New bitcoins are created by “mining” coins, a process that requires computers to carry out complex calculations. The more bitcoins there are, the longer it takes to mine new coin and the more electricity is used in the process.The energy usage attributable to bitcoin alone is equivalent to the annual carbon footprint of Argentina, according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, a measuring tool made by researchers at Cambridge University.",2021-04-13
 From badgers to bumblebees: how drought is affecting Britain’s wildlife,"As garden birds struggle to find food, many species are also at risk of overheating and dehydration","['Stephen Moss', '@stephenmoss_tv']","While warm summer days may seem like good news for Britain’s wildlife – and indeed they can be for some warmth-loving insects, such as dragonflies – for many species of bird, mammal and insect the current drought conditions are far from ideal.The British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) has warned that some of our best-loved garden birds are already struggling, as they try to raise their second broods of young. Blackbirds, robins and song thrushes need regular summer rainfall, as this creates the damp conditions that bring earthworms and other soil-dwelling invertebrates to the surface of garden lawns.Droughts mean that the worms stay down in the damper earth, meaning that the birds cannot catch enough to feed themselves or their chicks. This can lead to desperate measures: during the very dry spring and summer of 2011, hungry blackbirds even resorted to cannibalism, feeding on their own offspring. The charity RSPB advises putting out mealworms to provide an alternative food source for the birds.Falling birds and dehydrated hedgehogs: heatwave takes its toll on UK wildlife Read moreGround-feeding mammals such as badgers and hedgehogs are also suffering during this unusually dry weather; not just because they cannot get enough food, but also from overheating and dehydration. And while hot and sunny days may be better than wet and rainy ones for adult butterflies, as they fly from plant to plant to lay their eggs, they are bad news for caterpillars, which need plenty of foliage on their host plants if they are to feed and grow. A recent study showed that in the years following prolonged summer droughts, when plants die off early because of the heat, butterfly populations tend to fall.Other insects find it hard to cope in hot weather, too, but for different reasons. Prof Dave Goulson of the University of Sussex points out that because bumblebees have furry coats – an adaptation to flying and feeding in cool conditions – they are unable to forage in very high temperatures.As temperatures hit record levels, young house martins, swallows and swifts risk fatally overheating. In London recently, young swifts that had been forced to leave their nests before they were fully fledged were seen falling out of the sky. House martins are also unable to find enough mud to build or repair their nests.Prolonged dry weather increases the chances of wildfires, which spread very rapidly, especially on heathland and moorland. As early as April this year, 17 hectares (42 acres) of valuable wildlife habitat was destroyed at Canford Heath in Dorset, threatening the breeding success of rare species such as Dartford warblers, sand lizards and smooth snakes. And in July, a fire raged through the coastal scrub and reedbeds at Wild Ken Hill in Norfolk, home to the BBC’s Springwatch.A Dartford warbler. Photograph: D Middleton/South Downs Centre/PAElsewhere in East Anglia, wetlands such as the Ouse Washes are beginning to dry out. If enough rain does not fall soon, the BTO fears that the young of some wader species, including the avocet, may not be able to find food. Other waders that nest on peatlands may also struggle if the peat dries out, as this would mean that the larvae of craneflies – food for the dunlin and golden plover – are unable to survive.For all these species, a single bad summer, with resulting low breeding success, may not be a total disaster. But if summer droughts become the norm, because of the cumulative effects of the climate crisis, then breeding populations can decline very rapidly indeed.This is not the first time a summer drought has caused problems for wildlife. Anyone who lived through the summer of 1976 will recall the “plague of ladybirds” that appeared from July onwards, forcing holidaymakers to flee from beaches covered with thousands of these black-and-red beetles. Ladybirds had initially benefited from the dry weather, which produced an early glut of their favourite food, aphids. But as the drought continued, and plants began to wither and die, the aphid population collapsed, and the ladybirds swarmed in search of alternative food sources.In the decades since, warming temperatures have allowed several exotic species of bird to expand their range northwards. The BTO suggests that the current drought in southern Europe may be hastening that process, allowing black-winged stilts and bee-eaters to breed more frequently in the UK. While that may be good news for birders, this is also a clear sign that climate change is causing problems for these Mediterranean species, and a timely warning to us.",2022-08-24
" Before Covid, giving up flying was taking off. We need to get that momentum backAnna Hughes","Interest in low-carbon living, including pledges not to fly, was high before the pandemic. After lockdown, we must not allow climate action to fall off the radar",,"It’s hard to remember what life was like before the pandemic hit. A year and a half ago, 2019 was drawing to a close with something like a promise. It had been the year of Greta Thunberg, Extinction Rebellion and the school climate strikes, and the momentum was with climate activism. And 2020 promised to be the year of change.Helped by Thunberg’s yacht journey across the Atlantic, the spotlight was on aviation’s role in the climate crisis. An airline ticket is about the most carbon-heavy thing consumers can buy, and for those of us fortunate enough to be able to access air travel, our flights can quickly put us among the top polluters in the world.Climate crisis: Boris Johnson ‘too cosy’ with vested interests to take serious actionRead morePersonalities including John Humphrys drew attention for declaring they’d given up flying, but beyond the headlines a growing number of ordinary people were also quietly ditching plane trips. Enlightened countries, such as Sweden, saw a drop in air bookings, and rail provision rose across Europe. Much Better Adventures led the charge with Tourism Declares a Climate Emergency, a collective of outdoor and travel outfits taking action on the crisis. The travel pages of this paper drastically reduced the number of flights it took and wrote about.It seemed that the zeitgeist was with climate action, giving hope to campaigns such as ours. Flight Free UK was born at the tail end of 2018, with a simple ask: pledge to take a year off flying to reduce emissions and inspire a shift in the narrative around aviation. Having been in the lonely flight-free club myself for more than a decade, I was finally connecting with lots of others making the same choice. We went into 2020 with more than 6,000 signatures on our pledge. Along with climate activists across the world, we dared to hope that our time had come.Someone texted Radio 2 saying: 'Usually we’d be in Zante – but we couldn’t have asked for a better holiday in Whitby'Then Covid came along and stole the headlines. It was certainly a year of change – just not at all what we had imagined. Flight Free 2020 turned out to be a lot more flight-free than we could ever have anticipated.The shackles of lockdown saw two distinct behaviours emerge: pent-up demand for travel led to the emergence of “flights to nowhere”, a ghastly illustration of our addiction to flying; but people also started to appreciate their own neighbourhoods. After months of being cooped up, a swim in the Serpentine could feel as freeing as a dip in the Med. The simple pleasure of walking in UK woods can, with the right attitude, be as eye-opening as trekking in the Atlas mountains. Perhaps being forced to stay put showed us that we don’t have to go far to have a good time.Travel pages have long extolled the virtue of holidaying in your own country but, now compelled to do so, many more people swapped the beaches of Europe for UK ones. My favourite quote from 2020 was someone texting Radio 2 saying: “Usually we’d be in Zante – but we couldn’t have asked for a better holiday in Whitby.”It remains to be seen what effect the Covid crisis will have on our long-term flying habits. According to a YouGov poll, 30% of people plan to fly less after Covid, and only 15% plan to fly more. That may have more to do with coronavirus than climate concern, but now that there is the prospect of some freedom on the horizon, can we recapture that pre-Covid momentum?Some travel companies are on board: in early 2020, Sunvil launched its first rail-only holiday to five Greek destinations , and Inntravel now has a team dedicated to arranging rail journeys instead of flights. Others, such as Intrepid Travel and Wilderness Travel, launched UK trips for the first time last year, and Byway Travel, a 100% flight-free travel agency, started taking bookings.The government has yet to catch up, with multimillion-pound bailouts for airlines, Eurostar left floundering, a potential scrapping of air passenger duty, and yet more hikes in the cost of rail. There is no indication that the UK will follow the example set by France, which has scrapped air routes where a direct rail link of less than 2½ hours exists. The aviation industry is poised to ramp up operations as soon as restrictions are eased.So let’s not let the misery of the pandemic get in the way of our climate ambitions. Now, more than ever, it’s imperative that we take action. We now know that 2020 was the hottest year on record, and the six hottest years ever recorded all occurred in the past decade.The pandemic forced us to stay grounded. In future, could we stay grounded through choice?Anna Hughes is director of Flight Free UK. Find out more and make a flight-free pledge here",2021-10-20
" Disease outbreaks more likely in deforestation areas, study finds","Tree-planting can also increase health risks if it focuses too narrowly on small number of species, paper says","['Jonathan Watts', '@jonathanwatts']","Outbreaks of infectious diseases are more likely in areas of deforestation and monoculture plantations, according to a study that suggests epidemics are likely to increase as biodiversity declines.Land use change is a significant factor in the emergence of zoonotic viruses such as Covid-19 and vector-borne ailments such as malaria, says the paper, published on Wednesday in Frontiers in Veterinary Science.Even tree-planting can increase health risks to local human populations if it focuses too narrowly on a small number of species, as is often the case in commercial forests, the research found.The authors said this was because diseases are filtered and blocked by a range of predators and habitats in a healthy, biodiverse forest. When this is replaced by a palm oil plantation, soy fields or blocks of eucalyptus, the specialist species die off, leaving generalists such as rats and mosquitoes to thrive and spread pathogens across human and non-human habitats. The net result is a loss of natural disease regulation.“I was surprised by how clear the pattern was,” said one of the authors, Serge Morand, of the French National Centre for Scientific Research. “We must give more consideration to the role of the forest in human health, animal health and environmental health. The message from this study is ‘don’t forget the forest’.”The researchers examined the correlation between trends for forest cover, plantations, population and disease around the globe using statistics from international institutions such as the World Health Organization, the World Bank, the Food and Agricultural Organization and the Gideon epidemic database. Over the period of study from 1990 to 2016, this covered 3,884 outbreaks of 116 zoonotic diseases that crossed the species barrier and 1,996 outbreaks of 69 vector-borne infectious diseases, mostly carried by mosquitoes, ticks or flies.The paper shows outbreaks increased over time, while plantations expanded rapidly and overall forest cover declined gradually. By itself, a correlation is not proof of causality because other factors may be involved, such as climate disruption. The authors bolster their argument with multiple references to individual case studies that highlight the links between epidemics and land use change.In Brazil, scientists have demonstrated that deforestation increases the risks of outbreaks of malaria. In south-east Asia, studies have shown how forest clearing favours the mosquito Anopheles darlingi, which is a vector for several diseases. Loss of primary forests has also been identified as a factor in the emergence of Ebola in west Africa and the re-emergence of arthropod-borne leishmaniasis.The new study adds to a growing body of evidence that viruses are more likely to transfer to humans or animals if they live in or near human-disturbed ecosystems, such as recently cleared forests or swamps drained for farmland, mining projects or residential projects.This is shaped by trade patterns and consumer behaviour. A quarter of global forest loss is driven by the production of commodities such as beef, soy, palm oil and wood fibre. Mining adds to this problem by contaminating rivers and streams that are vital for a resilient ecosystem, carbon sequestration and soil quality.Morand said his study showed that disease risks needs to be added to risk-benefit analysis of new projects. “We should take the costs of public health into account when considering new plantations or mines. The risks are first to local people, but then worldwide because we have seen with Covid how quickly diseases can spread.”He is particularly concerned about the deteriorating environmental health of the Amazon rainforest. Under the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, deforestation has surged to levels not seen in more than a decade and public health systems have been so mismanaged that the country now has the worst Covid death rate in the world.“Everyone in the field of planetary health is worried about what is happening to biodiversity, climate and public health in Brazil,” Morand said. “The stress there is growing. The Amazon is near a tipping point due to climate change, which is not good at all for the world ecosystem. If we reach the tipping point, the outcomes will be very bad in terms of drought, fires and for sure in terms of disease.”Other areas of concern include the rainforests of the Congo basin and south-east Asia, and monoculture afforestation projects in China, Europe and the US. “Our results clearly suggest that it is not only forest clearance that is responsible for outbreaks of infectious diseases, but also reforestation or afforestation, particularly in countries outside the tropical zone,” the paper notes.Morand is now working on a more detailed study that will use satellite analysis of forest cover to examine links with disease. With more information, he believes it may be possible to predict future outbreaks and to work with local communities to build ecologically diverse and economically productive landscapes that reduce the risks.As the author of a 2016 book called The Next Plague, he says it is only a matter of time until the next pandemic. “The risks are very high. It’s just a case of when and where. We need to prepare.”",2020-08-01

","['Graham Readfearn', '@readfearn']","Environmental campaigners have asked Australia’s consumer watchdog to investigate an oil and gas industry public relations campaign that critics claim is misleading the public on the climate effects of fossil fuel.The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (Appea) last month dropped a claim in its “Future of Gas” advertising campaign that gas was “50% cleaner” than coal.Ad Standards said the claim was not specific enough and had not been substantiated, finding Appea had breached all three of its codes covering environmental claims.Appea launched the campaign in June to highlight “the importance of natural gas to the nation”.Do the fossil fuel industry’s claims of Australia’s gas-fired future stack up? | Temperature CheckRead moreNow lawyers representing environmental campaigners Lock the Gate and climate advocacy group Comms Declare have asked the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to investigate the campaign.“We hope this is a turning point in preventing greenwashing by coal, oil, and gas companies,” said Belinda Noble of Comms Declare.“Gas is mainly methane, which heats the atmosphere 84 times more than carbon dioxide over 20 years.“Advertising gas as being somehow ‘clean’ or ‘green’ is not only inaccurate – it is also immoral when global warming is causing record temperatures, death and destruction around the globe.”

In the letter to the ACCC, lawyers at the Environmental Defenders Office, representing the complainants, accuse the campaign of potentially misleading the public on several counts.The lawyers write that in some cases the actual climate impact of gas is much worse than the comparison of 50% cleaner than coal.The lawyers also write that comparing the greenhouse gas emissions of gas to coal was “potentially misleading” because it ignored a more relevant comparison to renewable energy.“Failing to disclose this information may lead the reader to the false conclusion that gas is the only energy source that releases less [greenhouse gases] than coal, when in fact renewable energy sources release almost zero [greenhouse gases] in the production of energy,” the complaint says.The letter also says that while the campaign claims gas generates about 20% of the electricity used by Australians, for the majority of people served by the National Electricity Market gas only generated about 6% of power.“Greenwashing is dangerous because it delays action on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and undermines competition and consumer trust in green or renewable products,” said Kirsty Ruddock, managing lawyer at the EDO.“Appea’s statements are designed to make the public think gas is good for the environment, when in fact it is driving dangerous climate change.“It is clearly in the public interest to ensure big polluters and their peak bodies, such as Appea, are held to account for their allegedly misleading or deceptive conduct.”Last month an Ad Standards panel found Appea’s campaign had breached its codes covering environmental claims.The panel investigated a complaint about Appea’s claim in its campaign that gas was “50% cleaner” than coal.The panel ruled the claim was “misleading, as the claim is not specific and does not make clear to the target audience the basis for comparison”.Appea pointed the panel to statements from the International Energy Agency and the former Australian chief scientist Alan Finkel to back up its claim.But a majority of the panel did not consider those sources to be sufficiently detailed to allow the claim to be properly evaluated.Appea has already removed the claim from its campaign. Statements that said gas was “around 50% cleaner than coal for generating electricity” now read “gas produced fewer emissions than coal when used to generate electricity”. Videos containing the claim have also been taken out of circulation.Experts have previously told the Guardian that in Australia’s main electricity grid gas has 61% of the emissions of coal, not 50%. They also point out that coal-fired power is not being replaced by gas in Australia, but by renewables such as solar and wind.The Guardian asked Appea to respond to the concerns raised in the ACCC complaint and to the findings of the AdStandards panel.Samantha McCulloch, Appea’s chief executive, said she believed the advertising was “clear and factual” and the association did not agree with the panel’s finding.“The fact that gas produces around 50% less carbon dioxide emissions than coal when used for power generation is widely established and recognised by leading authorities including the International Energy Agency (IEA), the US Government’s Energy Information Administration (EIA), the US Department of Energy and Australia’s former chief scientist, Dr Alan Finkel, in his review of the National Electricity Market.“However, out of respect for the decision and the process, APPEA promptly updated some campaign material when the decision was brought to our attention to take into account the determination.”",2023-07-20

 ‘Like a scene from Titanic’: floods in Assam submerge entire villages,"India’s monsoon season has been worse than usual, sweeping away possessions and leaving people huddling on raised ground","['Amrit Dhillon', ' in Delhi']","People living in Assam, in north-east India, are usually stoical about the flooding that occurs to a greater or lesser extent every monsoon season. But this year they say the situation is dramatically worse. “It was like a scene from Titanic,” one man told local media of the rising waters that have flooded all but two of the state’s districts.In some places entire villages are under water, while across the state 114,000 hectares of crops have been submerged and 5,000 livestock have been washed away. For those that remain, fodder is running out.Since April, 82 people have died in the rain and landslides, including two police officers who were swept away on Monday as they attempted a rescue.In the worst-affected areas, life has been reduced to huddling on any tiny patch of raised dry ground that people can find. Families living under tarpaulin tied to bamboo poles are using dwindling supplies of cooking gas to cook basic meals. There is an air of despondency over all that has been lost: furniture, utensils, documents, irreplaceable photos.“There was no time to save anything, it all happened so fast. My house was made of bamboo. It just broke. I saw my possessions vanish in a flash,” said a woman from the village of Nagaon who was sitting with her children and some saucepans on a bed that had been raised above the swirling waters with the help of bamboo poles.The unending rain has raised the water level in the Brahmaputra River and its tributaries, flooding villages. Barpeta district in Lower Assam is the worst hit.The Assam state disaster management authority has said more than 4 million people, including 1 million children, have been affected. It hopes to send trains carrying relief including diesel, petrol and medicine to the affected areas soon.A woman carrying a child wades through flood water in Barpeta. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesPregnant women, mothers with infants, elderly and sick people have been the worst affected. “My mother is 84 and has a heart condition. Her medicines were swept away with everything else. I can’t move while there is water all round and they are predicting more rain,” said Ashok Bohra, a local journalist.Those who are not living in tents on the roadside are in relief camps, where conditions are fast becoming congested and insanitary.Some images of the flooding have been striking. In the state capital, Guwahati, one man was seen strapping together wooden planks for a raft and placing a red plastic table on top with bottles of drinking water, candles, and matchsticks.

The only way forward, he added, was for people in Assam to become “flood-ready” and adapt to the changing weather patterns.",2022-06-21
Country diary: why do birdwatchers prize the ring ouzel so much?,"Wolf Edge, Staffordshire: This blackbird in disguise is scarce and getting scarcer – but that doesn’t fully explain its addictive appeal",['Mark Cocker'],"For the tenth time this spring, I’ve come here to catch sight of migrating ring ouzels. I suspect that of all the species that trigger impassioned responses among birdwatchers, this is the bird least known to the British public.The simplest explanation for both these responses is that ring ouzels are wild, upland loners that are getting scarcer almost annually. Today, there are 15,000 spread thinly from northern Scotland to Cornwall. Writing 108 years ago, WH Hudson described finding 40 to 50 breeding pairs near this spot. Now, I doubt I could take you to more than one.Another key explanation for this bird’s enduring appeal is that it triggers simultaneously the full shock of the other, alongside feelings of deepest familiarity. Ring ouzels look like blackbirds, except for a white or milky-tea quarter-moon across the chests in males and females respectively. As Hudson observed, the real joy of the beast is the revelation that “our” favourite garden thrush has a hitherto-unknown feral twin.Naturalists love these pairings and the fine-tuned parings that they demand. It means that every year, spring or autumn – when ring ouzels move through our islands using a series of traditional stopping places – observers must check every single distant, vaguely interesting blackbird until it faces them and confirms its ordinariness. But on every 10,000th occasion, a “blackbird” will turn and all the magic of a ring ouzel unfolds.The key to that rare moment is understanding a sequence of thrushy nuances: the longer wings and a frost-edged character to a ring ouzel’s back and coverts, as well as the rattling neurotic element in its voice. Before everything, however, it is the inexplicably fearful, unapproachable genius of the creature that makes most sightings so fleeting, and the speed of detection so critical.For me, these fine-grained discriminations make a nonsense of the traditional Romantic idea that science diminishes our love and experience of nature; or as Wordsworth proposed, “We murder to dissect”. Ring ouzels are the living outer expressions of an inner revelation that knowledge, including careful rational diagnosis, is no barrier to our encounter with nature, but a fundamentally entwined element in a self-perpetuated, life-loving affair.

" Plans to mine Ecuador forest violate rights of nature, court rules",Landmark ruling says mining permits issued in Los Cedros protected area breach Ecuador’s constitution,"['The age of extinction is supported by', 'About this content', 'Patrick Greenfield', '@pgreenfielduk']","Ecuador’s highest court has ruled that plans to mine for copper and gold in a protected cloud forest are unconstitutional and violate the rights of nature.In a landmark ruling, the constitutional court of Ecuador decided that mining permits issued in Los Cedros, a protected area in the north-west of the country, would harm the biodiversity of the forest, which is home to spectacled bears, endangered frogs, dozens of rare orchid species and the brown-headed spider monkey, one of the world’s rarest primates.Enami EP, Ecuador’s national mining company, held rights for mining concessions that had been granted in two-thirds of the reserve. The decision means that mining concessions, environmental and water permits in the forest must be cancelled after the court upheld a lawsuit brought by communities near Los Cedros that was successful in a lower court.The ruling by Ecuador’s highest court, published on Wednesday, upheld the rights of nature, which are enshrined in the country’s constitution, and said they applied across the whole country, not just to protected areas.Los Cedros is in the Chocó region of South America that includes parts of Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. It is one of the most biodiverse parts of the planet, home to flora and fauna found nowhere else on Earth.“This is a historic victory in favour of nature,” said Natalia Greene of the Global Alliance for the Rights of Nature, an NGO that argued for the court to keep mining away from Los Cedros.“The constitutional court states that no activity that threatens the rights of nature can be developed within the ecosystem of Los Cedros protected forest, including mining and any other extractive activity. Mining is now banned from this amazing and unique protected forest. This sets a great juridical precedent to continue with other threatened protected forests. Today, the endangered frogs, the spectacled bears, the spider monkey, the birds and nature as a whole have won an unprecedented battle.”Campaigners said the ruling set an important marker across Ecuador and the region, where several other mining and extraction projects are planned in ecologically important areas. Between 2007 and 2008, Ecuador enshrined the rights of nature in its rewritten constitution.Dr Mika Peck, a senior lecturer in biology at the University of Sussex first investigated the biological importance of Los Cedros in the mid-90s, compares the significance of the ruling to Thomas Paine’s Rights of Man, a key text in the American revolution.“It is important for the world to reflect on the limits of nature and to seriously question the effectiveness of current conservation policies and actions,” he said. “Policy frameworks that place humans in context as a part of nature, integrated into a system that balances intrinsic rights between legitimate subjects of the law, rather than placing humans as above, or apart from, nature, will be a necessary part of addressing the serious environmental issues that our planet is facing. This ruling is as important to nature as Thomas Paine’s Rights of Man were to our own species.”The Guardian has contacted Enami EP for comment. This article was amended on 3 December 2021. Dr Mika Peck is not from Ecuador as an earlier version said.",2021-12-06
Plantwatch: the strange organism so tough it can survive in space,Lichen survived 18 months attached to outside of International Space Station and raises prospect life could exist on Mars,['Paul Simons'],"Lichens are strange organisms, a partnership between a fungus that offers shelter, water and minerals, and an alga or cyanobacterium that supplies food from their photosynthesis. And even though lichens tend to be modest to look at, they are so incredibly tough that some can even survive the harsh environment of space.When lichens were attached to the outside of the International Space Station for 18 months they survived the vacuum of space, no water, extreme temperatures and the full onslaught of radiation and ultraviolet rays from the sun, and carried on photosynthesising.Lichens that were kept in a simulated Martian environment on Earth survived and were active, raising the prospect that life could exist on Mars, where the environment is intensely dry and cold, with low atmospheric pressure and radiation bombardment. In fact, lichens can cope with radiation 12,000 times the lethal dose for humans and still carry on photosynthesising, although their reproduction can be harmed. However, bacteria given the same treatment died. There is even a thought that life on Earth, or any other planet, could conceivably have been spread through space by lichens hitching a ride on meteorites, comets or asteroids.",2024-01-17
 This article is more than 2 months oldAlarm raised over water firm job of new environment secretary’s wifeThis article is more than 2 months old,"Steve Barclay married to executive at Anglian Water, which is under investigation for potential illegal dumping of raw sewage

UK politics live – latest updates
","['Sandra Laville', ' Environment correspondent']","Campaigners have raised concerns over a potential conflict of interest for the new UK environment secretary, Steve Barclay, whose wife is a senior executive at Anglian Water.Barclay took on the environment role in Rishi Sunak’s cabinet reshuffle this week. His wife, Karen Barclay, holds a senior position at the water company, as head of major infrastructure (DCO) planning and stakeholder engagement.As secretary of state, Barclay is responsible for overseeing the regulation of water companies. He is responsible for ensuring the water firms make improvements regarding sewage pollution via the government’s storm overflow reduction plan.Anglian Water is one of six companies under investigation by the regulator Ofwat for potential illegal dumping of raw sewage. The Environment Agency is separately in the middle of a huge criminal investigation into illegal sewage dumping by water companies involving more than 2000 water treatment works.Anglian Water ad banned by regulator over pollution recordRead moreWater companies are pressing government and the regulator Ofwat to approve £96bn investment in infrastructure improvements to fix leaks, stop sewage discharges and build more capacity at treatment plants, which they want customers to pay for via bill rises. Many critics say the public has already paid once for the investment, and should not be made to pay again for fixing problems which put the companies in breach of their legal duties.Tim Farron, the rural spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, said: “Ministers’ spouses do of course have the right to their own careers, but I do worry about the possible conflict of interest here for the man charged with forcing the water companies to clean up their act.“We need to make sure the secretary of state is fully committed to doing everything in his power to stop the sewage scandal.”This summer, Anglian Water pleaded guilty to allowing millions of litres of untreated sewage to overflow from a water recycling centre in Essex. It was fined £2.65m, the largest penalty imposed for environmental offences in the east of England region.Ashley Smith, of Windrush Against Sewage Pollution, said there was a possible conflict of interest for the new secretary of state.“It’s not just that the new environment secretary’s wife holds a senior post at Anglian Water, it is the fact that the water industry routinely operates outside the law, has misappropriated billions of bill payers’ money and now holds the country to ransom to hike bills to fix the mess it made and cannot be trusted to not make off with another windfall gifted by government,” said Smith.A government spokesperson said: “All Defra ministers declare their interests in line with the ministerial code.“There is an established regime in place for the declaration and management of interests held by ministers. This ensures that steps are taken to avoid or mitigate any potential or perceived conflicts of interest.”Craig Bennett, the chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts, who chairs Anglian Water’s independent challenge board, said: “It would prudent for him to make sure this has been declared publicly and that it is all out in the open. Then it is something that can be managed.”Karen Barclay has been approached for a comment. Anglian Water did not comment. The image on this article was replaced on 14 November 2023.

 ‘The blue flags are proof’: how Greece cleaned up its act on sewage,"Greeks take their seas seriously, with the construction of one of the world’s biggest sewage treatment plants a real game-changer","['Helena Smith', ' in Athens']","The shimmering waters along the Athenian riviera offer a welcome respite in the summer heat. In one of Europe’s most congested cities the sight of ever more beaches attaining blue flag status – a mascot of water quality – has heightened the sense of relief that the coastal location affords. For those who flock to its coves, rocks and sandy stretches, the shoreline that extends from the Greek capital’s southern suburbs has become the perfect antidote to the rising temperatures that have accompanied climate breakdown.It was not always so.“More than 20 years ago the waters around Attica [peninsula] weren’t for bathing as they definitely weren’t as clean,” says Prof Konstantinos Aravossis who until earlier this year oversaw water management policies at the Greek ministry of environment. “They are now because a lot of emphasis was put on improving wastewater treatment plants and that, of course, had a lot to do with regulations in the EU.”The establishment in the mid-1990s of a sewage plant on the uninhabited Saronic Gulf isle of Psyttaleia, off the port of Piraeus – an installation serving the 5 million residents of the greater Athens area and one of the largest in the world – is widely acknowledged as being a game-changer.“The blue flags that we see today in Attica are proof of just how much better the situation is,” says Aravossis, who now heads the ministry of environment’s forestry department.But with one of the longest coastline on the continent, Greece also takes its seas seriously. At last count Europe’s southernmost state had 581 blue flag beaches – second only to the 621 in Spain. In 2021, the EU’s environmental watchdog classified nearly 96% of monitored bathing sites in Greece as excellent.A visiting professor at Imperial College London, Aravossis is among Greek officials who have been left astounded by the news of popular beaches in the UK being inundated with raw sewage, and with it all the attendant risks such discharges will inevitably have on the environment and public health.“It’s very unexpected,” he says with noticeable understatement. “Obviously there has not been proper documentation and monitoring of the system. Here in Greece, and especially at the Psyttaleia plant, surveillance is very strict, which does not seem to have been the case in the UK.”Tourism has played a vital role in sensitising Greeks to the importance of keeping their seas and rivers clean. The sector is the national economy’s major industry, employing one in five workers and accounting for an estimated 25% of the country’s gross domestic product.Up and down the land, pristine waters have become a central part of the narrative to lure holidaymakers with the international blue flag programme regarded as a byword for local excellence.Voidokilia beach in Messinia, Greece, which has 581 blue flag beaches.

Excellent water quality over a sustained period and cleanliness of beaches are just some of the factors,” she adds.Fresh off the Archipelagos Institute’s research ship, Thodoris Tsimpidis marvels at the extraordinary biodiversity of the Greek sea – a direct product of waters remaining mercifully unpolluted. “Currents, winds and the fact that our seas are often very deep help enormously,” says the head of the marine conservation body. “Greek waters, it is true, are very clean, even in places where they shouldn’t be, and that is largely because they are aided by natural phenomena.”Archipelagos is among a growing number of organisations established with the express purpose of saving the Aegean and Mediterranean seas from the ravages of modern living. Raw sewage may not be an immediate risk, but plastic is, with alarming predictions by WWF Greece, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and others of plastic waste outnumbering fish in the oceans by 2050.

"The Dixie fire is almost out, but its inhospitable ‘moonscapes’ remain","Severe wildfires are making the recovery process for plants and animals more challenging, sometimes for years after the flames","['Gabrielle Canon', '@GabrielleCanon']","After more than two months, the battle to contain the Dixie fire – a behemoth blaze that swept nearly 1m acres, leveling mountain towns and blackening the conifer-covered landscape – is nearing its end.But even after the fire crews pack up, threats remain for the plants and animals that call this area home. Scientists are warning that the severity of today’s wildfires is making the recovery process increasingly challenging, sometimes for years after the flames are put out.The American west has evolved alongside fire, which is a natural part of the landscape. But fueled by warmer, drier conditions and an overabundance of parched vegetation, blazes are increasingly burning more ferociously, consuming nearly everything in their path.The size but also the severity of today’s wildfires is a growing concern. Fires that exhibit erratic behavior and burn with more intensity are more likely to leave behind only patches of living landscape.“There is the extent of the fire and there is the intensity of the fire. When you get these big intense fires, you mostly kill those animals,” said ecologist Brad Shaffer, the director of the UCLA La Kretz Center for California Conservation Science. “If you don’t kill them then when they come back and it’s just a big ash field, there are no plants and therefore no insects. They starve to death.”In these high-severity burns, vegetation on the forest floor is consumed by the flames, and shrubs and stumps are reduced to ash. The soil itself changes, and even beneath the ground, tree roots are burned. These moonscapes can take between five and 10 years to regenerate – far too long for some species to wait.Scientists are also finding that some landscapes remain permanently changed and trees struggle to grow where they once flourished. Surviving animals, faced with reduced populations after a fire, may resort to inbreeding, ultimately reducing their resilience while the climate becomes less hospitable.Firefighters work to contain the Dixie Fire in California. Photograph: Patrick T Fallon/AFP/Getty Images“What you are creating is analogous to an ocean that has a few little islands on it,” Shaffer said. “It is very hard to move across that super burnt landscape in a short amount of time.” For small animals, like the lizards and amphibians he specializes in, “you have to wait for it to come back”.Shaffer, who is studying how ecosystems recovered in the Woolsey fire, which burned in Los Angeles and Ventura counties in 2018, says research on the issue is still unfolding. But without mitigation, some animals may not be able to adapt.“It’s a very nasty feedback loop,” Shaffer said. “The result is small, isolated, genetically inbred populations that are often extremely compromised, with less resilience to catastrophic challenges associated with climate change and with little chance of recovery.”It’s still unclear what’s been left in the footprint of the Dixiefire. The Burned Area Emergency Response (Baer), specialized crews with the US Forest Service staffed by engineers, biologists, archeologists and other highly trained experts, are deploying into the cooled parts of the Dixie scar to assess the damage.While the official prognosis is yet to come, Brian Rhodes, the deputy director of fire and aviation management with the US Forest Service, says he is optimistic some areas may have been spared the worst. “There are definitely pockets of high severity but not as broad as one would expect,” he said. “Generally speaking I would anticipate it being a mixture of high severity, moderate severity and maybe in some places low severity.”Still, researchers have found that fire severity overall is trending in a more dangerous direction.There’s a concern these forests are going to move away from a forested ecosystem to something elseCamille Stevens-Rumann, fire ecologist“We are seeing an increase in the proportion of area burned at high severity with climate change,” said Camille Stevens-Rumann, an assistant professor at Colorado State University who studies fire ecology and recovery. The hot, windy days when high-severity burning is likely have defined the 2021 fire season, and helped fires like the Dixie evade containment efforts for weeks on end.Those conditions also make it more difficult for forests to heal the ways they once did. Healthy fires tend to burn low to the ground, creeping through the bases of trees and clearing the undergrowth. Severe fires shoot flames hundreds of feet high, scorching the canopies and overcoming natural defenses evolved across centuries. When older trees succumb, seedlings struggle.“Rather than having some standing trees helping shade the ground and keep it cooler and more moist, it’s just this large expanse of black charred earth which can make it difficult for trees to establish,” Stevens-Rumann said. “There’s a lot of concern about whether these forests are going to have a longer-term conversion, moving away from a forested ecosystem to something else,” she added, explaining that, on this trajectory, once-forested landscapes could soon shift to become shrub-covered chaparral, which is more flammable. Chaparral landscapes, in turn, could convert to grasslands.One of the millions of casualties of the Dixie fire. Photograph: Ty O’Neil/SOPA Images/REX/ShutterstockThis could also mean big changes for the animals that live there. “If we had the spotted owl or another endangered species that is used to a dense dark forest, they are not going to use the shrubland ecosystem in the same way, or perhaps at all,” she said. “We are changing the habitat for a lot of different species.”Climate change is the main culprit in increasing the intensity of fires but it has not acted alone. A long history of suppressing natural fire – the kind needed to keep forests healthy – has only made the problem worse.Officials are embracing and implementing badly needed mitigation tools, including forest thinning and prescribed burning, but scientists have said that more urgency and action is needed to slow the changes already under way.“The more preemptive action we can really do to stop that next large, high-severity fire is the best way we are going to maintain forests across our landscape,” Stevens-Rumann said. “A lot of times that’s fighting fire with fire.”",2021-09-22
AnalysisAustralia is on track … sort of: official expert advice urges a ‘big upward shift’ on emissions cutsAdam Morton Climate and environment editor,"Climate change minister tells parliament official projection of 40% cut does not factor in all Labor’s policy commitments

",,"Australia’s climate change minister, Chris Bowen, has declared the country on track to reach a 40% cut in climate pollution by 2030 – just short of the national target of 43% – but the government has been told a “big upward shift in momentum” is needed to tackle the problem.Giving the country’s first climate statement to parliament, which is now required annually under legislation passed earlier this year, Bowen said the official projection of a 40% cut did not factor in all Labor’s policy commitments, and that those measures would “lift our result to at least 43%”.The statement did not shed light on what the government would do to make deeper cuts in line with its goal of limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, an expectation raised by a UN-backed report if the Great Barrier Reef is to avoid being nominated as a world heritage site “in danger”. It also did not mention the country’s vast coal and gas export industries.Tracking Australia’s progress on the climate crisis and the consequences of global heatingRead moreBut the Albanese government did release three reports on Australia’s performance in dealing with the climate crisis, and what is expected over the next decade. They suggest the government can meet its climate targets if it implements its policies as promised, but also that there is not much time and action needs to accelerate.One of the reports – setting out future emissions projections – assumes proposed gas developments will go ahead at Narrabri in New South Wales, in the Northern Territory’s Beetaloo Basin and at sites in Queensland and off the north coast of Western Australia. The Greens said these developments would “put a safer climate further out of reach”.Here are some other key points.Australia is on track, sort ofWhile Bowen can reasonably claim the latest emissions projections suggest the government’s policies put it within striking distance of hitting its 2030 target, it’s not the main number emphasised. The baseline scenario – based on existing federal, state and territory policies and measures – gets Australia to a 32% cut by 2030 (compared with 2005 levels).The 40% conclusion comes from a “with additional measures scenario” that adds in Labor’s two main climate policies measures, which are still in development. They are changes to the safeguard mechanism – the Coalition scheme that was supposed to put a limit on industrial emissions, but hasn’t – and the “rewiring the nation” policy that is promised to hurry up the electricity transmission connections needed to reach 82% renewable energy on the east coast by 2030.

Other promised policies – a national electric vehicle strategy and a national reconstruction fund that will include investment in climate-friendly projects – are at an earlier stage and were not included in either scenario. A more meaningful analysis that incorporates all policies should be possible next year.But a couple of points can be made now. Nearly all the cuts by 2030 are still coming from the massive change in the electricity system as cheap solar, wind and backup replaces ageing coal plants. Just on announcements to date, including a new connection between NSW and Victoria and the Marinus link across Bass Strait, renewable energy is projected to provide 76% of generation.Elsewhere, there is little action yet. Emissions from transport, leaky mines and agriculture are expected to keep increasing. And the cut in pollution assumed from big industrial sites covered by the safeguard mechanism is modest.Tracking Australia’s progress on the climate crisis and the consequences of global heatingRead moreThe government has said it expects industrial sites covered by the safeguard mechanism to cut emissions by between 3.5% and 6% a year. The chief executive of the Carbon Market Institute, John Connor, points out that the projections assume the cut will be at the bottom end of this range. He is among those who say the changes to the safeguard, which sets emissions limits for 215 big polluting facilities, need to go much further.Looking ahead, the report projects the country is on track for just a 48% cut by 2035, suggesting a slow down after 2030 and far below what will be necessary. It is a rough estimate, but tells us again that significant new policies will be needed before the next election if the Albanese government is going to live up to its rhetoric on aiming for 1.5C.What the official advice saysThe first annual progress report by the Climate Change Authority makes clear what we know: the impact of the crisis is intensifying, with communities experiencing “more frequent, intense and prolonged extreme weather events”. It says deeper cuts are needed to avoid even worse events, and more needs to be done on adaptation and resilience.The authority stresses the country needs a big shift in momentum on emissions cuts to meet the government’s “ambitious new targets”. On average, the country needs to cut emissions by 17m tonnes a year – more than 40% faster than what has happened since 2009.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The message is that everyone has to act, though not necessarily at the same pace, and that the climate crisis needs to be “at the forefront of all government decision-making”.Another key point: while the technologies to meet the 2030 target exist, supply chain disruption, labour skills shortages and slow planning processes are potential roadblocks and all need to be improved.Bowen said the government accepted all of the authority’s recommendations.What Bowen saidSpeaking before a large number of invited foreign diplomats, including many from the Pacific, Bowen stressed the government’s early successes, including passing the climate legislation that set the emissions reduction targets in law. He said the projection of a 40% cut by 2030 was a one third improvement from a year ago, when it was 30% under the Coalition.He emphasised that the climate crisis has moved from a theory, to a prediction, to a lived reality that spares no one and described not acting as “an unforgivable act of intergenerational negligence”. He quoted the International Energy Agency, saying: “The world is struggling with too little clean energy, not too much. Faster clean energy transitions would have helped to moderate the impact of this crisis, and they represent the best way out of it.”Australia still trails most developed countries in climate performance ranking Read morePointing ahead to an expected battle over the safeguard mechanism, the minister noted that about 70% of facilities covered by the scheme had net zero commitments – an implicit warning that resistance to change would be at odds with their own promises.“Business as usual can’t be the usual business any more,” he said. “Businesses must step up and deliver on their commitments during this critical decade for climate action.”Meanwhile, pollution continuesFinally, the government released the latest quarterly emissions data, showing Australia’s climate pollution was basically flat – up 0.1% – over the year to June. Total emissions were for the year were 486.9m tonnes.Electricity emissions were down 3.7%. Transport emissions fell 1%, but only because of Covid-19 lockdowns in late 2021. Pollution from manufacturing, agriculture and the liquified natural gas industry were all up – and it is expected to increase from pollution in the next report.National emissions were 21.6% below 2005 levels – nearly exactly halfway to the 2030 goal. But the scale of the task at hand is better illustrated when emissions from land and forestry are removed.The rest of the economy, including all industries that rely on fossil fuels, are down only 2.8% over the past 17 years.00:02:58The truth about getting to net zero, according to the numbers – video",2022-12-02

","['Anne Davies', '@annefdavies']","The Darling-Baaka River at Menindee is on the brink of another environmental catastrophe, with dead fish already appearing along 30km of the river compromised by the last fish kill in March, according to experts.The office of the chief scientist is due to report by 31 August on the causes of the March disaster, which killed millions of bony herring (also known as bony bream) and thousands of other native fish and carp.But a survey by the NSW Department of Fisheries conducted in June, which has not been released, has revealed the poor state of the river between Menindee and Pooncarie.Dead Murray cod are already appearing in the river months before summer. Photograph: Graeme McCrabbThe Guardian understands the fisheries survey found the river already had very low levels of oxygen due to the breakdown of fish carcasses, which is expected to worsen when temperatures increase.The survey found only two mature Murray cod in a 140km stretch of river between Menindee and Pooncarie, suggesting the population has been decimated.Menindee resident Graeme McCrabb said dead fish, including cod, were being found every day around the weir pool at Menindee township, raising concerns about the quality of the town’s drinking water, and about what might occur in coming months.Wayne Smith, who owns a property 60km downstream from Menindee, said there were already high levels of algae in the river due to the nutrient load from the fish.

“The water quality just looks bad; it’s like grey dishwater,” he said.Several major fish kills have occurred in the stretch of river near the township.In January 2019 hundreds of thousands of fish died because of lack of flow and high temperatures leading to stratification of water and a lack of oxygen in the few pools providing refuge to fish.In January the region experienced record flooding. In March, millions of bony herring, which boomed during the floods, died in a fish kill that dwarfed the events of 2019.Menindee local Ross Files, who was born in the town in 1939, said fish kills were not regular events.“We never had a fish kill in the river until they started growing cotton in the catchment up north. It never happened,” he said.Regulated part of Darling-Baaka River and site of mass fish killThe March fish kill is still being investigated by the chief scientist, but a possible cause could be that the millions of new bony herring that spawned during the floods became trapped at the upper weir and consumed all the oxygen in the water.The office of the NSW chief scientist has also been asked to investigate longer-term issues around management of the river system and future emergency responses.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to The Rural NetworkFree newsletterSubscribe to Calla Wahlquist's fortnightly update on Australian rural and regional affairsEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When water temperatures start to warm up again as we move toward spring and summer, there remains a risk of further fish deaths in the Darling River at Menindee, as fish in an already stressed condition may succumb to any decrease in dissolved oxygen and increased competition for depleting resources.“This is particularly the case for bony herring, which boomed during the recent floods, and many are now in poor condition and more susceptible to environmental stresses.”She said the government was continuing to release water from Lake Pamamaroo to support fish populations.Dr Darren Saunders, the deputy chief scientist, said his report was on track to be finished in about three weeks.“We have spent time listening to the community and we are very conscious of their concerns,” he said.“We are now in the middle of doing our own sampling of the river and lakes and we are looking at developing improved emergency response measures to be put in place as soon as possible.“But we are going to have a data driven response wherever possible.”",2023-08-09
New calls to restrict Wimbledon’s plastic bottles – despite Nadal’s ritual,"The Spaniard likes to line up single-use bottles, but Laura Robson says tournament must up its environmental game","['Emine Sinmaz', ' and ', 'Tobi Thomas']","The former junior Wimbledon champion Laura Robson has joined calls for Wimbledon to limit the use of plastic bottles.The 28-year-old added that Wimbledon should ban single-use bottles altogether or limit players to just one, adding that fines for breaching the rules were “maybe something that needs to happen”.But the Olympic silver medallist acknowledged that restrictions would hit Spain’s Rafael Nadal, because he is “superstitious” and known for carefully lining up multiple water bottles as part of a long-established courtside ritual.In a panel discussion about the environment at SW19 today, Robson said: “There are all the players on the practice courts, just taking a couple of sips from a water bottle and then leaving it there. Should there be a fine, maybe? We’re joking about it, but maybe that’s something that needs to happen.“I don’t know how you would go about implementing that, whether you would have court covers snitching on people on the court. I don’t know how you would go about organising it but it would be a start.”Robson was joined by Hattie Park, the All England Lawn Tennis Club’s sustainability manager, and former GB rower Melissa Wilson, who said Wimbledon should follow the French Open’s lead. Players used only reusable bottles this year after a government ban in France on single-use plastic.“The players had to use reusable bottles and they were branded by a sponsor,” Park said. “I think the fact that that’s just happened at another grand slam tournament … offers potentially an alternative [for Wimbledon].”Former junior Wimbledon champion Laura Robson retires at 28Read moreBut Robson said athletes would need to stick to one bottle for the plan to be effective. “I was watching a lot of matches in Paris and people had multiple reusable bottles because you’ve got your water, your energy drinks, your electrolytes and all sorts,” she said. “As soon as you put someone then using five reusable bottles, it sort of loses its power.”Campaigners have criticised Wimbledon and Evian, which sponsors the competition, for providing players with single-use bottles. Hundreds of thousands of bottles are used at the tournament each year, with an estimated 420,000 distributed in 2019.Maja Darlington, a plastics campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: “Wimbledon is a world renowned event. If they can afford to pay players £50,000 for simply participating in the first round, they can afford to provide them with reusable water bottles and ensure they aren’t contributing to the ever-growing plastic crisis.”Robson said that tennis has “such a long way to go” to become environmentally friendly but introducing reusable cups on court could be a “big change”.“We’ve also got players who are superstitious – you know, Rafael with his water bottles, and they all need to be in a certain row,” she said. “There’s other players who prefer the plastic bags around the rackets after a restring. And it’s just slowly but surely changing the mindset.”Nadal, a 22-time grand slam title winner, has commented on his courtside routine, saying he takes “a sip from one bottle, and then from another. And then I put the two bottles down at my feet, in front of my chair to my left, one neatly behind the other, diagonally aimed at the court.”He has previously been hit with a number of violations for taking too long between points as he performs his ritual, which also includes picking at his underwear.Sign up to Down to Earth, our exclusive weekly newsletter from our top climate crisis correspondents.Robson said there were wider problems with tennis’s environmental credentials: “We’re travelling every week. Usually on a plane – there’s hardly any opportunities to use other forms of transport – and then you get to a big tournament like this. And you know, there’s a fleet of Land Rovers, which are lovely, but not necessarily that environmentally friendly.”Park said the club was working with Evian about the possibility of installing water refill stations on court, and spectators could bring reusable bottles to SW19. The club has previously said Evian’s bottles are made from 100% recycled plastic.On environmental goals, Park added: “There’s progress that we need to go way up, we are actively talking with our partners about how we can improve and get better.”",2022-07-01
 Fire-ravaged Greek island of Evia hit by floods and mudslides,"Experts say loss of forests, which act as natural flood control mechanism, has worsened impact of heavy rain ","['Helena Smith', ' in Athens']","Storms and heavy rain have laid bare the scale of the destruction wreaked by massive fires on the Greek island of Evia, with communities now having to deal with flooding and mudslides.After a summer of record temperatures igniting unprecedented wildfires across Greece, authorities in affected regions have now been put on the defensive as the nation is hit by a second bout of severe weather in less than a week.“We’ve already seen unusual amounts of rain in some parts of the country,” said Dr Kostas Lagouvardos, a research director at the National Observatory of Athens. “But from Thursday we expect this [new] weather system will create a very dangerous situation, especially in burned areas where the soil is already saturated and streams are overflowing.”An estimated 300,000 acres of forest and bushland were incinerated in Greece over the summer amid temperatures that hit 47.1C, the highest on record.More than a third of the devastated area was in northern Evia, according to the national observatory. In recent weeks communities have been in a race to construct flood barriers to compensate for lost forest cover, with authorities clearing riverbeds and people piling sandbags around their homes.Flames burn on the mountain near Limni village on the island of Evia, on 3 August. Photograph: Michael Pappas/APHowever, for many the storms have already been calamitous: more than 200 houses were damaged at the weekend as heavy rain and widespread flooding made roads impassable, sending mudslides cascading down mountains now devoid of vegetation into the sea.“The situation is dramatic. A mountain of mud has been removed from the village,” said Giorgos Tsapourniotis, the mayor of Mantoudi, likening the scenes to a biblical catastrophe. “We have hundreds of calls to pump out water from homes.”Evia locatorBy Thursday as the storms reached Athens, ripping masonry from the Greek parliament and in some cases forcing children to be evacuated from schools, the weather service had issued a red alert warning people to avoid any unnecessary movement. Heavily forested areas north of the capital were also decimated by wildfires in August.“What we are witnessing is the loss of critical ecosystem services that forests provide,” said Demetres Karavellas, who heads WWF Greece, noting that the Evia wildfire was the biggest ever recorded in Greece. “The natural ability of the soil to withhold water, to act as a flood control mechanism, has been destroyed across a massive area.”The Mediterranean has been singled out as a wildfire hotspot, with forest fires erupting from France to Turkey over the summer. Scientists agree that the climate crisis is partly to blame for creating the conditions that make forests more vulnerable and floods easier. With temperatures hotter than they had been for 30 years, bone-dry terrain had been transformed into a tinderbox fuelling hundreds of fires “in every corner of the country”, the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, said at the time.Firefighters pump water following a flood at the village of Agia Anna, at the northern part of Evia. Photograph: Thodoris Nikolaou/APWithout assistance from more than 20 countries deploying firefighters and water-dropping planes, emergency services would not have been able to cope.Karavellas said there was “a sense of deja vu” with fires of ever-growing ferocity being recorded because of poor forest management policies and lack of follow-up after the blazes.“The key issue here is prevention. We have to stop such fires happening in the first place by moving from a paradigm of suppression to prevention with whatever that entails,” he said. “If we were ill-prepared in the past, there is no excuse now.”",2021-10-15
‘We have given Earth a fever’: author John Vaillant on the firestorms coming for us all,His book about a blaze so hot it vaporised concrete and turned a Canadian city to ash has just won the Baillie Gifford prize. John Vaillant explains why the world we think we live in no longer exists,"['Claire Armitstead', '@carmitstead']","On the afternoon of 3 May 2016, firefighters spotted a plume of smoke near the Canadian oil city of Fort McMurray. It was early in the fire season for the subarctic region and slabs of ice were still floating on its lakes. A water-bombing helicopter was immediately scrambled but it was already too late. Within two hours, flames had roared through 60 hectares (150 acres) of forest. By the end of the day, 90,000 people had been driven from their homes. Whole neighbourhoods had been reduced to ash.A week later, recalls John Vaillant in Fire Weather, a gripping account that has just won the Baillie Gifford prize for nonfiction, the city looked as if it had suffered a nuclear blast. All that remained of many houses was piles of nails. Sifting through the ashes of her home in what had been a five-storey building, a local journalist found just a colander and some barbecue tools. Even the ceramic toilet had been vaporised.Vaillant was working on his second novel at a writing retreat in Italy when the story began to circulate on social media. “It was like hearing Houston was on fire,” he says. “Fort McMurray is the petroleum hub of Canada. It’s a wealthy, powerful, charismatic, overbuilt place and the idea of it being on fire was absolutely shocking.” The city, Vaillant goes on, “was shrouded in a firestorm cloud 45,000ft tall. The fire had punctured the stratosphere, generating its own lightning and hurricane-force winds.”Firestorm … an abandoned truck on Alberta Highway 63 near Fort McMurray. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesAmazingly, the evacuation was so efficient that the only two fatalities were due to a car crash in the rush to get out. In their efforts to describe the horror, the survivors reached for fantasy: to Tolkien’s fire demon Balrog; and to the asteroid-strike fires of the film Armageddon. These survivors, says Vaillant, bear witness to the future. “Spending time with them was like spending time with Isaiah or Ezekiel – except they’re named Carol and Dave and Rob, and they do regular jobs. But they saw something most of us have never seen and never want to see.”Our concept of England is like our concept of Canada: not flammable. But we’re being forced to recalibrate very rapidlyTalking to Vaillant is itself rather like being sucked into a vision of hell. A silver-haired 61-year-old who moved from Massachusetts to settle in Vancouver 25 years ago, he only started writing in his 30s, specialising in the collision between human beings and the natural world. The Golden Spruce, published in 2006, told the story of an anti-logger who took a drastic measure: felling a tree sacred to the Haida people to raise awareness about the dangers of cutting down many more trees elsewhere. Four years later, The Tiger followed a hunt for a man-eater in the frozen wastes of the Russian taiga. Whereas these earlier books were about finding an accommodation with nature, Fire Weather is about what happens when none can be found.Bright-eyed and urgent the morning after his win, Vaillant talks with messianic fervour about the bigger theme of Fire Weather: a global breakdown in climate conditions capable of supporting life. It’s not lost on him that we’re sitting in chilly London, where runaway bush fires feel like distant TV spectacles. But don’t be fooled, he warns. “Our concept of England is like our concept of Canada: not flammable. But we’re being forced to recalibrate very rapidly, and it creates enormous dissonance psychically and intellectually. And that’s where climate change has an advantage over us, because we’re really attached to the old world we grew up in. We built all our responses, planning and infrastructure around a world that really doesn’t exist any more.”Atmospheric heat and dryness of the forest floor were the key ingredients in the lethal cocktail that destroyed Fort McMurray, creating a fire that burned with a new ferocity, reaching record temperatures. But there was another factor: a suburban sprawl of homes built and furnished with the same petrochemicals on which the Alberta city had made its fortune.Raging … people flee the flames. Photograph: Jeromegarot/Twitter/EPA“Spalling,” writes Vaillant, “is a verb you don’t encounter much below 500 degrees.” It’s what happens to concrete when all the water is burned out of it. Part of the job of the writer, he believes, is to find a vocabulary for this new reality. “Words possess spell-casting, shock-inducing power even in this jaded age.” The English language, he says, already has terms for all this, but there hasn’t been much need for them. Now, like firefighters, they are being called up and sent in to action. He cites another word: “Infandous – a thing too horrible to be named or uttered. For a mayor or fire chief, fire running rampant through a town they are charged with protecting is infandous.”The problem with dealing with infandous situations is if they are too horrible to be named, they usually don’t get planned for. This is what happened in Fort McMurray and its surrounding forests: firefighters ended up having to bulldoze gaps through the city’s housing to stop the blaze. This sort of failure of imagination has been dubbed the Lucretius problem by Black Swan author Nassim Nicholas Taleb, who paraphrased the Roman poet and philosopher with the words: “The fool believes the tallest mountain in the world will be equal to the tallest he has observed.”This problem is compounded by the refusal of nations and businesses to disinvest in oil, despite decades of warnings. Back in 1979, big oil seemed united behind the stated mission of the first World Climate Conference – to “foresee and prevent potential manmade changes in climate that might be adverse to the wellbeing of humanity”. But recently, says Vaillant, something has changed in the petroleum industry. “I don’t know if it’s since the invasion of Russia, or if maybe the petroleum industry sees the end coming, but they seem more openly profit-driven, and less interested in wasting time mincing words about greenwashing. They’re insisting, ‘No we’re going to burn as long as we can.’”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to BookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books with our expert reviews, author interviews and top 10s.

Photograph: John Sinal/Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-Fiction/PAAnd the Carols and Daves and Robs of Fort McMurray go along with this, because many of them come from impoverished coastal areas of Canada and need to earn a living. In this, they are not dissimilar from the young Mexican migrant who featured in Vaillant’s 2015 debut novel, The Jaguar’s Children. “These are folks from remote rural areas with really limited opportunities, who are trying to participate in the 21st century. And the petroleum industry pays well, but you’re being paid well to destroy the Earth.”Two years after the Fort McMurray blaze, Vaillant reported for the Guardian on another big wildfire in Redding, California. These already feel like ancient history, he says. “Over the last summer alone, Canada has generated 100 cumulonimbus fire clouds. These are major planetary phenomena, not unlike hurricanes, except they’re born out of fire. Volcanoes are usually the only natural thing that can generate that much energy.”Who needs fiction when nature can provide such a fast-moving, harrowing story? “The 21st century is a place we’ve never been,” he says, “And that’s not a facetious statement. People talk about the new normal but there is no such thing. And there never will be. What we are in now is clima incognita – the unknown climate. This is what our lives are going to be. And fire is just one particularly charismatic manifestation of that. Obviously, you’re having floods and droughts and other phenomena that are all driven by the same engine. It really all comes down to heat and the energy it generates, and all that comes back to carbon dioxide and methane.”How has Vaillant’s research affected his own lifestyle? “Well, I’m flying all over the place right now,” he says. “I’m practically living in a jet. But I’ve really never felt like this about a book before. I will serve it as long as people want to talk about it, because I can’t think of anything more important. We’ve given this earth a fever. And the irony is that the fossil fuel industry is, in essence, a fire industry: we draw these substances from the ground at great expense so we can burn them.”A chill passes through the room as Vaillant’s tone turns truly apocalyptic. “Fire has empowered us and enriched us beyond our wildest dreams. But the strange side-effect is that we’ve also empowered the climate. We now live in a world that is more explosively flammable than at any time in human history.” John Vaillant’s Fire Weather: A True Story from a Hotter World is published by Sceptre.

Country diary: Quick thinking to save a slow worm,"West Dartmoor, Devon: The shape of these legless lizards is smooth and uniform, as if rolled by a child from Play-Doh",['Charlie Elder'],"I came across it stretched out on the lane in the sunshine like a length of cable. A handspan from end to end, it took a moment to recognise the gleaming cord as a living creature – a slow worm, soaking up the warmth of the road surface. It’s a species I seldom see alive around my Dartmoor home.Over the years I have regularly found dead individuals along this village lane: golden bracelets hammered flat by passing traffic. This one, lying motionless, was risking the same fate, so I crouched down to pick it up.Roused from its stupor, it began wriggling frantically, fully charged with solar energy. I had to be careful not to grasp its rear end as a slow worm will shed its tail to escape, being a legless lizard – a term that sounds like the punchline to a joke about boozing reptiles.Country diary: A warm and safe place for slow worms to breedRead moreWhile a slow worm can be mistaken for a snake, it lacks the contours of a serpent, the jawline or patterning. Its simple shape is a smooth cylinder that hardly distinguishes head from body from tail – it might have been rolled by a child from Play-Doh.Once in my hands, it calmed and I could observe it more closely. The burnished colouring reminded me of brass trumpet pipe, while dark flanks and belly, coupled with a pencil line of black down the back, indicated that this was a female. Males are greyer, more uniform in colour and have a light underside.I took it through to my garden and released it beneath a piece of corrugated iron laid on top of my compost heap. The rusting metal sheet was put there several years ago in the hope that slow worms would be attracted by the trapped heat beneath. So far, it had only provided shelter for a toad or two.Slow worms are widespread reptiles in the UK, known to make themselves at home in gardens, both rural and urban, and I hope this one sticks around. They are supposedly long-lived – at least those that avoid basking on tarmac. So until they evolve decent road sense, I’m happy to act as crossing patrol and steer those I find to safety.

‘Everyone will be watching’: US midterms cast a long shadow over Cop27,Some fear the outcome of the 8 November elections might derail US leadership on the global climate crisis,"['Oliver Milman', '@olliemilman']","For Joe Biden, the United Nations climate summit in Egypt is the crowning stage to trumpet the US finally passing major legislation to slow dangerous global heating. But the thoughts of the US president and delegates from around the world are likely to nervously flit to events 6,000 miles (9,65km) away – knife-edge midterm elections back in America.The climate talks, known as Cop27, begin in earnest on Monday when more than 90 heads of state convene in Sharm el-Sheikh amid warnings from scientists that the world is heading towards disastrous climate breakdown without further, deeper cuts in planet-heating emissions. António Guterres, secretary general of the UN, has warned governments heading to Egypt that they face “economy-destroying levels of global heating” and that their efforts to stem this disaster were falling “pitifully short”.‘Climate carnage’: UN demands funding surge to save millions of livesRead moreBiden’s administration is aiming to enter Cop27 in a mood of determined optimism, officials have said in briefings, having successfully secured passage of the landmark Inflation Reduction Act thanks to Democratic votes in Congress over the summer, a $370bn (£331bn) package to boost clean energy that is the first significant climate bill ever enacted by the US.But the White House’s attempts to portray the US as an empowered standard-bearer of climate action risk being undermined just a day into the conference, with midterm elections on Tuesday potentially shifting control of Congress to Republicans, sharply critical of what they call the president’s “radical green agenda”.Biden will arrive in Sharm el-Sheikh on 11 November, shortly after the midterm election, but probably before the full results of the vote. The prospect of the president’s program being partially unpicked by Republican gains would dampen hopes of further progress from the world’s largest historical emitter of greenhouse gases.The US will arrive with a good message that it’s a leader on climate, but the political winds can quickly changeAlice Hill“Everyone at Cop27 will be watching the US election and will be trying to understand what it means, it will affect the overall tenor of the talks,” said Nathan Hultman, a climate policy expert who was part of the US’s negotiating team at last year’s Cop26 talks in Scotland.“We have this strong, transformational body of work from Congress which has completely changed the narrative on the US. We are in a good position to reach our emissions reduction target, but obviously it is harder if elections don’t go to plan.”Two-thirds of US money for fossil fuel pours into Africa despite climate goalsRead moreThe US has been a hugely influential yet unreliable actor during the climate crisis, with its unusually partisan politics leaving leaders of other countries to nervously watch American elections for sharp swings in climate policy. “The US will arrive with a good message to tell that it is a leader on climate, but the political winds can quickly change,” said Alice Hill, a former advisor to Barack Obama, now climate expert at the Council on Foreign Relations.“If the results go against the Democrats we are unlikely to see more climate legislation and there will be more legal challenges to actions taken by the Biden administration. There will be question marks over how much the US can follow through on climate.”John Kerry, Biden’s climate envoy, has remained bullish over the prospects of using American influence in Egypt. Scientists have warned that the world remains badly off track to avoid disastrous climate change, with emissions reduction pledges to date delivering a likely 2.5C (4.5F) in global heating, over pre-industrial times, which is well beyond the internationally-agreed ‘safe’ limit of 1.5C (2.7F).“No country has a right to be delinquent in not putting up an NDC [a nationally determined contribution to cut emissions], not strengthening it where they can, and not being part of this effort,” Kerry said in a recent briefing with journalists, adding that “everybody needs to do their part here” and he wants “to make sure that everybody understands we’re doing the things necessary to keep 1.5C alive”.A sign promoting Cop27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Photograph: Thomas Hartwell/APKerry is likely to come under pressure at Cop27 from developing countries unhappy that a promised $100bn (£89.4bn) a year from rich countries in climate finance has yet to be delivered, as well as on the issue of loss and damage, which would provide poorer nations a form of compensation from floods, heatwaves, droughts and other impacts they did little to cause themselves.A group of 143 climate groups have written to Kerry to criticize the US’s “recalcitrant” stance on loss and damage, demanding progress on the issue in Egypt. “The United States has stood in the way over the loss and damage facility, and countries that are suffering right now are still demanding that facility,” Vanessa Nakate, a Ugandan climate justice activist, said recently. “I need to see the United States helping those that are suffering right now.”Delegates from less wealthy countries say they are almost at their wits’ end over the lack of progress on damages paid by the US and others. “We recognize the key role of the US in these climate talks and we congratulate their steps to taking leadership in the fight against climate change domestically,” said Madeleine Diouf Sarr, a Senegalese official who is chair of the Least Developed Countries, a negotiating bloc of 46 nations.World leaders at Cop27 can’t ignore the plight of imprisoned Alaa Abd El-Fattah | Caroline LucasRead moreBut Sarr added that “we are reaching the point where our patience with hearing the same old arguments is over. Now, look around the world to see all the devastation that could not be adapted to, It is simply obvious that climate change outpaces our abilities to perfectly prepare for it. We cannot rebuild houses with words.”US negotiators have said they are open to discussing the idea at Cop27, but are wary of opening up any sort of liability that could be imposed upon America. Kerry said he wanted “serious dialogue” over loss and damage but has not committed to any form of deal. Regardless, Republicans would probably try to scupper any attempt at providing any sort of new climate aid to developing countries, should the GOP prevail in the midterms.“Biden still has two years left in his term and there are now strong regulations in place that will be sticky and help nudge the existing momentum on renewable energy and electric cars,” said Hultman. “Depending on that momentum, the outcome of the election may not be hugely consequential. But we will have to see how things lie after 8 November.”Democrats, meanwhile, are not only fretting over their electoral prospects going into Cop27 but are questioning the setting of the talks themselves, given Egypt’s dismal human rights record. “Egypt was the wrong choice for Cop27,” said Don Beyer, a Democratic congressman who has called on Kerry to raise human rights issues with the Egyptian government. “Its government jails environmental and political activists and treats NGOs as a threat.”",2022-11-07
Country diary: For a moment it’s just me and a golden plover,"Northam Burrows, Devon: This glowing bird is not quite sure what to do with itself, and nor am I",['Elizabeth-Jane Burnett'],"Flooded pools and saturated ground have deterred most of the walkers. I think myself alone, crossing the waterlogged stretch between estuary and sea, looking only at the mosses, golden and fluffed up, threaded softly through the sodden grass. My eyes have been fixed low, but something causes them to rise. One small lift of the head and I have landed somewhere else, in another realm entirely, where time forgets to flow and birds are made of gold.I watch the golden plover on the ground before me, basking in the shining plumage. The brilliant sparks, scattered flames roaring in brown relief, seem to enact a special alchemy before my eyes – there is gold being made, here, in this living bird. When I am able to leave the speckled fire of the feathers, I look into its eyes. With its head tilted and slender build, it is not as cocksure as I would expect the owner of living gold to be. It is not quite sure what to do with itself, and nor am I. I could live in this moment for days.Instead, conscious of my looming size and lack of precious metals, I back away. Squelching down, my feet meet the water seeping in through old boots. Though I am flushed with sudden cold, I don’t react. My movements are small and quiet. The glowing bird looks on in silence. I cross over a runnel to the side and resume my walk with the water in between us. It seems satisfied with this arrangement and stays where it is. Walking backwards, I see its frame growing smaller as the surrounding sky increases, darkens. The only sun is on the ground; its flaming feathers break through the clouds.We watch each other for a long time. When it is out of view, I turn my head and let it drop once more, eyes sinking into soggy ground. Although the sun has gone, there are echoes still, trickling through the grass and buried low. I scan the submerged mosses, panning for gold. Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary",2023-02-23
Young country diary: it’s ‘Mary Berry’ picking season again,South Wales: It’s summer time and our gooseberry bush is full of fruit (and thorns) ,,"The gooseberries are growing again. In Welsh they are called eirin Mair, berries of Mary, or “Mary berry” as my dad says. This year we collected about 200 of them from the bush in our small garden, about the same as last summer in lockdown. The ones we grow are green and have small spiky hairs on them which look strange. They taste really sharp when you eat them. We’ve made quite a few gooseberry fools with yoghurt, cream and icing sugar. It is one of my favourite desserts. I have also made gooseberry ice-cream.I scratch myself on the thorns of the bush quite a lot when picking them. Once after I did that, I wrote a short story about gooseberries causing an illness around the world when you ate them. Scientists later find a cure which involves getting a deep scratch from the gooseberry bush thorns. Everyone got cured, but it took a long time for people to queue at the various locations where we have gooseberry bushes.Anwen, 8 Read this week’s other YCD by Riana, 12: what’s up with the ladybird?",2021-09-30
 Melbourne student and climate activist runs for board seat at energy giant AGL,Ashjayeen Sharif wants Australia’s biggest greenhouse gas emitter to be 100% renewable by 2030,"['Graham Readfearn', '@readfearn']","An 18-year-old student and climate change campaigner is bidding for a seat on the board of energy company AGL, Australia’s biggest greenhouse gas emitter.Ashjayeen Sharif, from Melbourne, wants the company to phase out its “dirty coal-burning power stations” by 2030 and replace them with 100% renewable energy.“I think AGL shareholders should consider what matters for their families and their children and realise that climate change is a defining issue of our time,” he said.Industry and energy groups remain in the dark when it comes to Australia’s emissions reduction strategyRead moreIn a notice of the company’s annual general meeting, the AGL chairman, Peter Botten, wrote that shareholders are recommended to vote against Sharif’s nomination.The notice, which confirms Sharif will be allowed to speak at the AGM next month, says Sharif’s “skill set and experience would not add to the effectiveness of the board”.AGL says emissions from its coal and gas power plants were 42.2Mt last financial year and make up about 8% of Australia’s entire greenhouse gas footprint.Also at the meeting, AGL’s directors are recommending shareholders vote against a resolution asking the company to align its business with the Paris climate agreement to keep global temperatures “well below 2C”.Sharif, a student at the University of Melbourne, said he had already experienced the climate crisis through more heat extremes and his family, some of whom live in Bangladesh, had been through floods and cyclones.

"Country diary: An unassuming chapel, full of death and life","Ayshford, Devon: It sits alone, tucked between canal and motorway, with centuries-old carvings that remind us of our mortality",['Anita Roy'],"The 15th-century chapel at Ayshford stands alone in a small, undulating field next to the Grand Western Canal. It is an unassuming building, facing slightly away from you as though preoccupied with other things, nudged aside by centuries of industrious human activity.In the early 19th century, engineers and labourers built the canal to ferry goods from Taunton to Tiverton. The canal never had a chance to live up to the grandeur of its title, cut short by the coming of the railways. The little village and the tiny stone chapel are now doubly bypassed, as the M5 thunders past, leaving this quiet stretch empty of traffic, bar the odd pottering moorhen or the Formula One flash of a kingfisher.The spring rain is fine and pervasive, so gentle it barely disturbs the pewter-grey surface of the water. We heave open the wooden door and step into the dry silence. The pews are stippled with dusty white splotches: tell-tale signs of bats in the belfry. Julia, whose family now owns the adjacent house and surrounding farm, sits down at the ancient organ and pedals it into life. It wheezes plaintively like a ghostly chorister.Ayshford Chapel has ‘tell-tale signs of bats in the belfry’. Photograph: Julia PoundIn one corner of the chancel is a huge stone tomb dedicated to the brief life of Henry Ayshford, who died in 1666 “aged one yeare and nine mo”. At the other end is another reminder of our mortality: an 18th-century stone carving of a reclining figure, now headless, cradling a skull. I take my phone out to click a picture, but the settings are wrong and I catch my own startled face in a selfie vanitas.The chapel still belongs to the Ayshford family, but is looked after by the wonderfully named Friends of Friendless Churches, a charity whose founders include TS Eliot and John Betjeman. Julia and her family are busy raising funds to repair the bell in time for the Queen’s platinum jubilee.Outside, the early flowers, known as spring ephemerals, have colonised the banks. Primroses, daffodils and violets make the most of their fleeting time before the trees come into leaf and gobble up the light.We walk back along the towpath through the soft rain, buoyed with renewed wonder at our ephemerality. Behind us, the cracked bell waits to be rung. Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary",2022-03-31
 This article is more than 6 months old‘Definitely unprecedented’: Vermont wildlife also affected by historic floodingThis article is more than 6 months old,"Fish, beavers and skunks all suffered from the deluge this week. But good news: populations are healthy and they will rebound","['Edward Helmore', ' in Montpelier, Vermont']","The toll to wildlife from climate crisis-related weather events is an area that often gets overlooked in their immediate aftermath. But after the flooding in Vermont this week, previous weather calamities – including Tropical Storm Irene, in 2011 – can offer some clues.Fish in Vermont’s rivers, primarily species of trout – brook, rainbow and brown – have been found to move upriver during increased water flow to less turbulent areas, including tributaries or flooded fields, or find refuge behind fallen trees or rocks.Wolverines are the ‘embodiment of wilderness’. Can they make a US comeback?Read more“This is definitely unprecedented, but studies of smaller floods show that often fish are not displaced and are in the same pools before and after a flood,” said Will Eldridge, an aquatic habitat biologist with Vermont’s fish and wildlife department. “They can often survive in place by finding some refuge behind a structure or ride the edges of the flow up into the flood plain.”After Hurricane Irene, though, some fish populations fell by 50%, Eldridge says.“But the silver lining is that fish populations do recover pretty quickly, and they can do that because there is less impact in the headwaters and smaller streams, or they can migrate and recolonize areas that have been impacted,” he continued. “So we work hard to protect those headwaters and also provide connectivity between streams and systems.”Fish are not the only type of wildlife that get displaced. Eldridge’s wife noticed a number of displaced skunks in Montpelier in the immediate aftermath of this week’s flood. They had probably been nesting in the banks of the Winooski River and its tributary streams before they were flooded. Muskrats and weasels, too, were probably displaced.Our wildlife populations in Vermont are really healthy, abundant and sustainable, so they’ll be able to reboundTyler Brown of the Vermont fish and wildlife departmentOne of the most distressing sights around Montpelier in recent days have been the bodies of beavers hit by cars on the roads. Tyler Brown, a wildlife specialist with the department who specializes in beavers and runs the beaver baffle project, which helps to protect beaver-created habitats and studies how their dams can help slow flooding, says the Vermont floods this week will have displaced the beaver population – but only temporarily.“When we get this amount rainfall in so short a time it is likely that beavers will have been displaced from their dams because it’s not likely that a beaver dam could withstand that amount of water,” Brown says. “When it comes to normal thunderstorm-type flooding, beaver dams hold and add capacity for capturing water, and allow water to spill over into wetland areas and release it slowly.” But in a catastrophic flood like on Monday, he says, “it depends on where the dams are in the watershed.”While it is possible some beavers may have died in the flooding – there were reports of beavers swimming around during the high-water period of the storm – Brown predicts the overall population will be just fine.“Like humans, beavers are pretty resilient, so they’re likely already rebuilding to re-create their habitats,” he said. “We will just leave them be and let them figure it out. They know their habitat pretty well, so they’re going to move back to suitable sites in their wetland habitats where there are a lot of young trees – willows, alders, maples – to eat the phloem, or inner layer of bark.”Overall, wildlife populations tend to bounce back after flooding events while populations of bears, dear and turkey tend to move temporarily to higher ground.“Our wildlife populations in Vermont are really healthy, abundant and sustainable,” Brown emphasized, “so they’ll be able to rebound.”",2023-07-13
How tide has turned on UK tidal stream energy as costs ebb and reliability flows,Investors are seeing rising potential in tidal power as turbines become more powerful and easier to deploy,"['Seascape: the state of our oceans is supported by', 'About this content', 'Tom Wall']","For decades the immense practical difficulties of harnessing the powerful tides flowing around Britain’s shorelines have put off investors and government officials searching for big renewable energy sources.But as the costs of deploying turbines in tidal streams fall, more and more people are seeing the potential in an energy source that creates energy as the tides ebb and flow at predictable hours every day – energy that is renewable but not intermittent.The cost of generating power from tidal streams has fallen by 40% since 2018 – and a report published last month by a government-backed research centre, Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult, forecasts prices could fall below nuclear energy in little over a decade, with one-megawatt hour of power due to cost as little as £78 by 2035 compared with £92.50 for the new Hinkley Point C power plant.Simon Cheeseman from the research center argues tidal stream energy is at the “point of commercialisation” as companies are keen to scale up production and deployment. But he says the sector still needs careful nurturing to ensure it follows the successful trajectory of offshore wind, which in 11 years has gone from generating only enough energy for 4% of British homes to generating enough for 33% of British homes. “In the early days of offshore wind, you had strong government support. This is the perfect blueprint for tidal stream energy,” he says. “There is no reason tidal can’t follow that same route.”Orbital Marine, which operates what it says are the world’s most powerful turbines below a plane-like floating platform near Orkney, has secured government funding to deploy three more floating turbines next year. Each platform can generate enough power for 2,000 homes and creates an estimated 100 jobs, according to the firm. “We want this to kickstart a real phase of change for us. We want to start manufacturing consistently and pull in more commercial investment,” says Andrew Scott, the company’s chief executive. “This is the first time in my 20 years in marine renewables that we’ve got a genuine chance of making tidal stream energy work commercially.”tidal power graphicAnother pioneering developer, Simec Atlantis Energy, is planning to install up to 56 turbines on the seabed at the northernmost tip of Scotland by 2027. “We’ve got the world’s largest tidal stream project off the coast of Caithness – 70% of the global tidal output has come from that site,” says Sean Parsons, the company’s external affairs director. “We’ve just won a government contract to expand that site from what is now 6 megawatts to take it all the way up to 34 megawatts – enough power for 68,000 homes. It’s tidal at scale.”Orders are even coming in from the rest of the world. “I’m feeling very excited about the industry and about what we are doing,” says John Meagher, director of business development at Nova Innovation, which operates seabed-mounted turbines off the remote Shetland Islands. “We are doubling the size of our Shetland tidal array from three to six turbines and we’ve exported our first turbine to Canada. We’ve won a feasibility study to look at the potential for an array [of turbines] in Indonesia. It just feels like things have really started to change.”An illustration of Orbital Marine’s underwater turbines. Photograph: Orbital MarineUnlike tidal barrages and tidal lagoons, which involve mounting turbines in sea walls, tidal stream turbines are lowered directly into strong tides out at sea. The challenges of installing and testing turbines in sometimes turbulent waters have made it far more costly than building wind and solar farms. But developers have been steadily refining their designs and driving down costs, with turbines becoming more powerful and easier to deploy at sea. “We are learning by doing: it used to take two days to connect up devices in the water but now it takes just two hours,” says Cheeseman.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But we know for certain when the tides come in and go out,” says Cheeseman. “It provides the energy buffer that you need in a system that will increasingly depend on irregular power.”Government support, however, has been patchy. Ringfenced funding was introduced in 2008 but scrapped in 2016, leading to the liquidation of some developers and restricting the industry to small-scale prototype turbines for five years. But at the end of last year the ministers allocated £20m worth of funding to the sector, under the government’s “contract for difference” scheme, which provides a guaranteed price for renewable energy. Four commercial-scale tidal energy bids, including two from Orbital Marine and one from Simec Atlantis, were successful. These projects are expected to deliver a near fivefold increase in the energy from British tidal power by 2027, upping the capacity installed from 10.4 megawatts to 51.2 megawatts.The government’s renewed faith in the sector is already attracting a surprising range of private-sector investors. “It was almost an impossible job to raise investment but since [the funding announcement] we’ve managed to get investment from major oil and gas providers and we’ve got an active inbound interest in equity investment right now,” says Scott.Nevertheless, problems remain. Unlike offshore wind, there is no official target for marine energy including tidal stream power, which is needed to drive investment. And the process of getting approval for underwater turbines can be extremely long-winded. It has taken Nova Innovation two-and-a-half years from gaining the seabed lease to being ready to install a turbine in Nova Scotia, Canada. But in the UK it can take more than twice as long to complete a tidal stream energy project, with everything from environmental impact assessments to grid connection causing delays. “From the word go … to actually putting turbines in the water, you are looking at six years – that’s a huge difference,” says Meagher.The tidal stream industry is growing once more. But there is no guarantee that ringfenced subsidies for tidal stream energy will remain in the next funding round, expected at the end of the year. “This is arguably the most important period,” warns Scott. “We’ve got proven technologies that are ready to be commercialised and growing export markets. If the government falls short in its commitment now, it could squander this incredible opportunity for the UK to become a world leader in tidal stream energy.” This article was amended on 24 November 2022. By 2027 British tidal power’s capacity will increase from 10.4 megawatts to 51.2 megawatts – not the energy created, as an earlier version said.",
 This article is more than 9 months oldReports of rotten pork being sold in UK may lead to tighter control of FSAThis article is more than 9 months old,"Therésè Coffey may bring Food Standards Agency, now overseen by health department, under remit of Defra","['Supported by', 'About this content', 'Sophie Kevany', ' and ', 'Helena Horton']","The UK government is considering tightening control over the Food Standards Agency (FSA) after news that allegedly fraudulent pork products found their way on to supermarket shelves.Therésè Coffey, the secretary of state for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), told the House of Commons on Thursday that she would look at bringing the FSA under her department’s control.An investigation by the trade publication Farmers Weekly found that until at least the end of 2020, one of the UK’s top food manufacturers had sold mislabelled and sometimes rotten meat to retailers.Meat produced by the supplier, as yet unnamed, is reported to have ended up in products such as ready meals, quiches, sandwiches and other produce sold in Tesco, Asda, Co-op, Morrisons and Marks & Spencer.The FSA, a non-ministerial agency overseen by the Department of Health and Social Care, which is responsible for public health in relation to food in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, has launched an investigation into the alleged supply chain fraud.The chair of the environment, food and rural affairs (Efra) select committee, Sir Robert Goodwill told the Guardian that having talked to the Farmers Weekly team behind the investigation, and read the reports, it was “obvious that the inspectors appear to have been misled by the company, which hid the suspect meat, sometimes in lorries or in other parts of the factory, during the time it took for the inspectors to have a cup of tea and put on their protective clothing on.”He added: “We could be looking at people going to prison because of how serious this all is.”Goodwill said he had “naively assumed was reporting to Defra but actually it was arm’s length and part of the Department of Health and Social Care, which tends to come to it from a health point of view rather than being closer to the supply chain as Defra would be.”Asked if a parliamentary inquiry might be launched into the supplier, Goodwill said inquires could take time but that a “one-day evidence session … with people from the FSA” was a possibility.Any full-blown inquiry might wait until investigations were completed, he said. “We don’t want to undermine the prosecution. But we [the House of Commons cross-party environment food and rural affairs select committee] will be discussing what course of action to take after the Easter recess.” Defra’s farm minister, Mark Spencer, said he had met the FSA and hoped it would deliver a criminal prosecution. “We will be keeping a close eye on the investigation,” he said. “And we’ll leave that with the Food Standards Agency to deliver a criminal prosecution.”Spencer said he would not make any further statement on Thursday because of the “ongoing criminal investigation” that involved “very serious allegations” that the FSA had a responsibility to investigate. Spencer said he was in regular contact with the meat industry and the FSA.The Farmers Weekly investigation found that tens of thousands of tonnes of foreign pork mislabelled as British had been finding its way into the supply chain each week. The supplier has been accused by former employees of regularly “washing” visibly bad hams in saltwater, and of mixing rotting pork with fresh product for further processing.On Wednesday, Darren Davies, the head of the FSA’s national food crime unit (NFCU), said the agency was “carrying out a criminal investigation into how a supplier was allegedly providing products labelled as British when they were in fact sourced from elsewhere.”Davies said the investigation was “complex” and that “all new lines of inquiry … including any potential food hygiene breaches at the premises” were being pursued. “If any evidence of a food safety risk is found, then necessary action will be taken,” he said.Last year, Davies said, the FSA “advised retailers … to check their cooked meat supply chain and to apply extra due diligence in their checks. We don’t give out these alerts without a reason.”Davies said the cost of living crisis could mean that food fraud increased as suppliers face pressure to turn a profit.
This article was amended on 30 March 2023 and 31 March 2023. An earlier version said that Robert Goodwill was Defra minister of state; in fact he is chair of the environment, food and rural affairs select committee. The original piece implied that the inspectors were from the FSA, but in fact inspections would be carried out by local authorities and the industry’s own auditors. It was further amended to reflect that Goodwill was asked about the possibility of a parliamentary inquiry, not a government inquiry.

‘We run from men only to meet crocodiles’: Kenya’s drought is deadly for women,"As poverty and lost livelihoods fuel threats in the home, those who have found refuge still risk their lives walking miles in search of water","['Supported by', 'About this content', 'Peter Muiruri', '  in Samburu']","The setting sun brings a warm glow to the huts in the village of Umoja in Samburu county, Kenya. Christine Sitiyan sits outside her home with her beadwork, carefully running the thin thread through tiny bead holes, hoping she can finish the colourful belt she is making before darkness sets in. The traditional belt can fetch 3,000 Kenyan shillings (£20), enough to cover her needs for a month.This tranquil scene is very different from her troubled past. Like many girls in her community, Sitiyan never finished school but was married off as a young teenager. Seven years later, with two children, she left her husband, unable to endure the beatings from a man she says could no longer fend for the family in an increasingly harsh environment.“He would beat me almost every evening out of frustration,” says Sitiyan, 25. “The drought killed part of his family’s livestock, while raiders from a neighbouring community stole the rest.” He took up manual labour, earning 300 shillings a day, barely enough to provide for the family. “One day, I just took off with the children and found refuge here.”Sitiyan is among scores of women and girls in Umoja, a village that has become a rescue centre for women and girls escaping domestic violence, female genital mutilation (FGM) and early marriages. There are no men in this manyatta, the traditional homestead.Christine Sitiyan, 25, found refuge in Umoja village after fleeing from her husband. Photograph: Peter MuiruriWhile the women may have escaped these threats, they are still potential victims of “drought-instigated violence”. Along with women in other marginalised counties such as Garissa, Marsabit, Mandera, Isiolo, Wajir and Turkana, they are at great risk of sexual molestation as they trek long distances in search of water.John Kitui, country director of Oxfam Kenya, an organisation that works with local groups helping to build resilience, says: “As the drought continues, families have nothing to fall back on and are forced to marry off daughters early to receive dowry payment. Without school fees, it is often girls who are forced out of class who then bear children at a young age. The resulting stress often leads to domestic violence.”Women are also the unintended victims of tribal conflicts as communities fight over dwindling resources. Men are forced to move remaining livestock tens of kilometres away to find foliage, and the women and children left behind are at increased risk of attacks by bandits.Men who are unable to cope with the drought take it out on womenHenry Lenayiasa, Samburu chiefA 2021 food and water assessment report for Samburu states that conflicts triggered by “competition for rangeland resources … have resulted in loss of people’s lives and their livelihoods”, with local leaders reporting increasing climate-related cases of domestic violence.Henry Lenayiasa, a chief in Samburu, says cases of violence against women by men who can no longer eke out a living in the harsh environment are on the rise. He says residents may have heard about climate breakdown and how it affects them, “but men who are unable to cope with the drought take it out on women”.“We have lost livestock in great numbers during the drought. In Kenya’s arid north, a man without livestock cannot provide and loses self-esteem. This is likely to trigger cases of domestic violence. If we do not address climate matters adequately, such cases will only escalate,” says Lenayiasa.A woman in Korr, Marsabit county, walks with her donkeys in search of water. Photograph: Peter MuiruriWomen in these marginalised communities are exposed to risk of attacks from other men and from wild animals as dwindling resources mean they have to travel farther from their homes to get water or firewood.“No place is safe for us,” Sitiyan says. “I was almost beaten up after some young men waylaid me on the way to the river, but I managed to escape. It is a risk we take daily in order to provide for our children.”For Sitiyan and the 38 women in Umoja, the nearby Ewaso Ng’iro River was their main source of water. But its flow has been interrupted by extensive droughts that at times left the river bone dry. A decade ago, Nasa’s Earth Observatory described the riverbed as “a pale tan ribbon of sand” after a prolonged drought in 2009. At other times, the river has flooded and displaced thousands. The river has little water currently, and what there is is contaminated by domestic and wild animal waste.Kenya rejects UN court judgment giving Somalia control of resource-rich waters Read moreOn a hot Thursday morning last week, the Guardian joined three women – Jane Nomong’en, Paulina Lekureiya and Kareni Lematile – for the 25-minute walk to the river. The unmarked route weaves through thick bushes. “This is where they hide,” Nomong’en says, pointing to a nearby thicket where a moran (young Samburu warrior) tended some goats. “There are no men in our village to protect us from the [troublemakers].” Along the route are several water pans dug in recent years to collect rainwater. It never rained.Left to right: Kareni Lematile, Jane Nomong’en and Paulina Lekureiya walked for close to two hours to find water. Photograph: Peter MuiruriA steep gulley leads us to the riverbed where the women find a spot with soft sand and hope it will yield some underground water. Lematile, the youngest, is tasked with scooping out the sand with a cup to make a hole wide enough for water to seep up. It is exhausting. She takes a break every few minutes while the others keep watch. “A 14-year-old boy was killed by a crocodile while fetching water up there,” Lekureiya says. “A woman was also attacked by a crocodile near the same spot. She was five months pregnant. We run away from men only to meet crocodiles.”It takes Lematile 20 minutes of scooping out sand before water begins to collect at the bottom. Using the cup, she painstakingly collects the water in four, 10-litre containers. This takes another hour. The women take a cupful each, and so does Lematile’s son. “We get some stomach upsets but what options do we have?” says Lematile.Kareni Lematile drinks the water dug up from the riverbed. The water can cause stomach problems. Photograph: Peter MuiruriAbout 100 metres away, a group of young men are scooping out large quantities of sand from the river to fill a truck and sell to developers, much to the chagrin of the women. Sand harvesting leaves the riverbed bare, unable to hold water during the dry season. It also results in floods during heavy rains. The women are afraid that if it goes on they will have to walk even farther to find water, exposing them to more risk of violence and attacks from wild animals.The women in Kenya’s arid areas know that their future security depends on political efforts being made far away this week at the Cop26 climate talks in Scotland, a country where turning on a tap brings instant water.“World leaders at Cop26 must deliver on promises to provide finance to these communities to enable them cope with the effects of climate crisis by addressing its root causes,” says Kitui.",2022-10-19
ReviewWines for a warming world,"Ever-soaring temperatures are a challenge to wine makers, but these Mediterranean wines from forward-thinking vineyards and hardy grape varieties will be able to cope",['David Williams'],"Gallina de Piel Roca del Crit, Empordà, Spain 2018 (£19.99, butlers-winecellar.co.uk) This has been another exceptionally hot summer in southern Europe, one in which news outlets across the region have reported the record-breaking temperatures without any trace of Guinness Book-style wonder, just a kind of numbed certainty that the climate crisis is here to stay. Mediterranean winegrowers, their senses finely attuned to the tiniest of changes in weather patterns – changes they can taste in their wines as well as see and feel in their vineyards – have been in the advance guard of warning about climate change. And many have been asking which places, and which varieties, can remain viable as 40C+ temperatures become the norm. Some have looked for mitigating cool by planting at higher altitudes. Others, such as the makers of this gorgeous carignan-grenache blended red, seek out the moderating influence of the sea, and, in this case, the buffeting Tramuntana wind in their vineyards on and around the Cap de Creus peninsula just south of the French border.MIP Classic White Provence 2020 (£14.95, leaandsandeman.co.uk) The duo at the helm of the Gallina del Piel operation – which includes David Seijas, the former sommelier of Ferran Adría’s long-closed but lastingly influential Catalan three-Michelin-star restaurant, El Bullí – is more concerned than most with providing a clear indication of the vintage conditions. The colour of the cap sported by the bicycling chicken on the illustrated labels denotes the type of vintage. For 2018, the cap is red, which means an unusually hot, dry year. But the wine is very far from being hot or heavy: there’s an underlying freshness behind the aniseed and rosemary-scented red and blackberry fruit that is the result of careful winemaking, the seaside positioning of the grenache vines and the advanced age (up to 86 years old) of the carignan. There’s a similar combination of sun and strong moderating wind (“11 different winds!” say the producers) in the vineyards between the Mediterranean and the Ste-Victoire mountain that produce the fruit for the impressively expressive MIP dry white.Clos Colombu Tribbiera Rouge, Corsica, France 2018 (£17, Harvey Nicholls) The grape variety behind MIP White is vermentino, which has become increasingly popular across the Mediterranean and warmer parts of the New World in recent years thanks to its ability to retain freshness and brightness in hotter temperatures. Certainly the MIP has a lovely zip to it: there’s grapefruit and lime, but also more expansive tropical fruit and a satisfying balance between the mouth-filling and the mouth-cleansing. Vermentino is also the main white grape variety in the distinctive Italy-meets-France winemaking culture on Corsica, where leading producer Clos Columbu again makes the most of the moderating, cooling influence of the sea and the mountains in its vineyards above the Gulf of Calvi. The estate’s white (100% vermentinu) is a beautiful expression of citrus, stone fruit and herb; its red, a blend of the local sciaccarellu and niellucciu (aka Tuscany’s sangiovese) with a little of southern France’s syah, is vividly cherry-scented with notes of thyme and oregano and effortless succulent drinkability.Follow David Williams on Twitter @Daveydaibach",2020-06-15
" This article is more than 2 months oldInterview‘Steve Bannon is watching us closely’: Naomi Klein on populists, conspiracists and real-world activismThis article is more than 2 months oldMaya Goodfellow","Author speaks candidly about a ‘mirror world’ that feeds our anxieties, distorts reality and fuels the polarisation of society",,"Naomi Klein is aware that her new book, Doppelganger, looks strange. A distorted picture of her face stares at you from the front cover. “Everyone who holds it looks like they’re holding my severed head, including me. It feels like Macbeth,” she says. Her laugh punctures the quiet communal space we’re sitting in on the first floor of a London hotel in late September.But the weirdness is intentional. It’s supposed to capture what she’s writing about – a mirror world where her sense of self becomes distorted. Her starting point is her very own doppelganger, the writer Naomi Wolf. For more than a decade Klein has repeatedly been confused with Wolf. What at first irked her became more frustrating – destabilising, even – as it moved to social media and Wolf dived full on into conspiracy culture, allying with the far right in the process. The two are so frequently mixed up that social media algorithms began to autocomplete Klein’s name when people were writing about the latest thing Wolf had said or done.Best known for her writing and activism on corporations, disaster capitalism and the climate crisis, Doppelganger is in many ways a departure for Klein. More conversational and personal, it is funny and honest. Speaking softly on the other end of a sofa, in a rather grand book-lined room, Klein tells me one of the reasons for this is that she wanted to write in her own voice, not lean into some idea she had in her head of what a serious intellectual should sound like.View image in fullscreenIn Doppelganger, Klein writes about her sense of self becoming distorted.Her concern, though, was that it might be too specific; that the response would be “OK, that’s interesting for you but what does it have to do with me?” I wondered, too, when I heard the premise. But it works. Partly because it’s refreshing to read someone so established write with such candour about their insecurities, but also because many of the big themes of Klein’s work are still there.It’s tempting to focus on the Naomi Wolfness of it all, but she is just a case study. As well as being Klein’s doppelganger, she is also a doppelganger of herself. Once a prominent feminist and Democratic party adviser, Wolf is now aligned with the likes of Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon and has become part of what Klein calls the mirror world. This is where conspiracies are spread, where left critiques of corporate power are absorbed and twisted so “deregulated capitalism” is framed as “communism in disguise” and “where soft-focus wellness influencers make common cause with fire-breathing far-right propagandists all in the name of saving and protecting ‘the children’”.Klein analyses how the inhabitants of the mirror world have ended up there, including the allure of online clout and the payouts of the attention economy. But it’s also the anxiety created by the climate crisis. It isn’t only people who are becoming doppelgangers of their former selves, Klein says, the Earth is too – producing “vertigo on a planetary scale”. Where there were once woodlands, teeming with life, there are now nature-depleted farmlands, we are facing the possibility of a new mass extinction and people all around the world are breathing toxic air. It might not be “one of the conscious factors of what is making you behave in certain ways” but it “is a universal experience”: the “interlocking ecological crises” are part of why people feel despair, says Klein.The problem is that for some people, the mirror world speaks to these anxieties better than anything else. Not by seriously addressing the climate crisis but by playing on these feelings for its own ends – an authoritarian political project which is highly nationalist and has elements that are “explicitly fascist” (although not everyone is in the mirror world for this reason).View image in fullscreenA mirror world, writes Klein, is one where left critiques of corporate power are twisted so ‘deregulated capitalism’ is framed as ‘communism in disguise’. Photograph: Sebastian Nevols/The GuardianTake Bannon. “While most of us who oppose his political project choose not to see him, he is watching us closely. The issues we are abandoning, the debates we aren’t having, the people we are insulting and discarding.” And this focus on popular issues could be his ticket to the next wave of electoral victories, Klein warns.People like Bannon co-opt truths – such as how elites take advantage of emergencies for their own ends, one of the arguments of Klein’s The Shock Doctrine – and mix them with dangerous lies, such as the “great reset” conspiracy. They hijack and obscure the left’s arguments – tapping into people’s worries, they turn themselves into the vanguard of resistance, without offering any real alternatives to the “corporate predation” they rail against.Using conspiracy culture, they become the only source people trust, regardless of what they hear, read or even see themselves. One recent example, Klein says, is that a directed energy weapon caused the Maui wildfires. “Everything has to have an alternative story, it’s a great way to have an obedient base.”Naomi Klein’s doppelganger – podcastRead moreThe mirror world is not to be brushed off lightly. But what is important is to understand how we ended up here. It’s too easy to say people in the mirror world are the ones who “have no regard for material reality”, Klein says, and that “we are the people who are guided by truth and science when we all know we are in various stages of denial”. The “grotesque mockery and language and words that go on in the mirror world are only possible because of a generalised cheapening of words that is happening at the centre”. Politicians say they care about the climate crisis but continue subsidising fossil fuels and opening coalmines – she points to the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, who joined the 2019 climate strikers that were protesting against the policies of his very government.View image in fullscreenSteve Bannon, says Klein, watches the ‘issues we are abandoning, the debates we aren’t having, the people we are insulting and discarding’. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/GettyFor Klein, the mirror world tells us as much about ourselves as it does about the people we’re looking at. This goes for the left, too, where she suggests too much time is spent building personal brands. “I still care, far too much, about the image I am projecting into that world,” she writes of her anxiety about being confused with Wolf – acknowledging the irony given Klein wrote No Logo, “a treatise against the rise of lifestyle branding”. She asks us all to reflect: “What aren’t we building when we are building our own brands?”I can relate (though not to the doppelganger/internationally renowned writer part). Typing furiously online, sharing articles and videos, feels alluring and urgent but also self-indulgent and hollow. Klein says our online avatars make us less human, “less capable of changing and evolving, even in the face of pressing ecological and political crises”. This affects leftwing movements, which are in favour of inclusive and caring policies but do not always behave in those ways.Klein says one of the reasons the book is more personal than her others is that she didn’t want to chastise people. “It’s not me being outside of it shaking my finger. I’m saying I have a branding crisis, that’s pretty ironic. I’m concerned about the way this is impacting movements that I have been part of.”She recognises that in the capitalist economy, people can make money by creating these brands, and that some of us disappear into these personae because the world around us is overwhelmingly bleak. “We don’t know how to know. It’s too big; whether it’s our own complicity in labour abuses, or in extinctions or wars.”This is not a lamentation of the way things used to be, a one-dimensional argument about political polarisation or an apolitical plea to be kind to each other. Klein is encouraging us to be attuned to what is going on in the mirror world and to combat it by going back to first principles.“When you’re stuck in the realm of ‘this is their analysis, this is our analysis, they’re in the realm of conspiracy but we understand its capital’ … people don’t really know what to make of that, it’s all just talk … until you’re railing against the elites and you’re actually trying to materially take some money away from them and give it to workers.”View image in fullscreenMembers of the United Auto Workers union march through Detroit. The more ‘real-world activism’ there is, says Klein, the more counterfeit populism is denied power. Photograph: Matthew Hatcher/AFP/GettyPointing to automobile workers on strike and tenant organising in the US, she says the more real-world activism there is, the more counterfeit populism is denied at least one of its sources of power – some of the others being white supremacy, toxic nostalgia and patriarchy. “One of the wellsprings is that people are really mad at elites, and that’s one we can do something about – give people the real thing.”Klein says Doppelganger is not an exercise in “I have figured out the left, come follow me” – it’s one contribution to the creative work that’s needed on climate and the other interconnected challenges of our time.Still, all of this is dizzying. We are, after all, meeting as part of a promotional tour for her book, featuring her face on the front and with her ideas in it. Klein tells me how the front cover came into being, which involved a very last-minute search for something that captured the bizarreness of the book and bringing the cover designer of The Shock Doctrine and This Changes Everything out of retirement (he’s now a fiction writer). “At a certain point you have to defer to good design,” she says, “but I admit that it’s full of contradictions.”She doesn’t bristle when I ask about it. She did say earlier in our conversation that she was trying to hold herself a “little more lightly”. It’s important we all try to do this, she argues, because if we’re going to deal with the weight of “the vast, complex planetary crisis”, we can only do that together.

"My Cyclone Diary: after the flood, the dread that replaces panic","In the second instalment in a series of diaries about Cyclone Gabrielle’s aftermath in New Zealand, Anna Rankin describes the fears, rumours and unexpected effects of a lack of internet in the town of Wairoa

My Cyclone Diary: The day we watched the flood swallow Wairoa
","['Anna Rankin', ' in Wairoa']","It is difficult to record historical events that will in time determine policy decisions and economic outcomes, and the lives of those affected, while events are still unfolding. There are the quick impressions – men wrestling escaped bees on a roadside deep in flood waters, a flattened cornfield marked by the shape and force of the torrent, a mud-soiled child on a stoop, wide plains transformed into lakes, the eerie chime of a stuck train signal. Then there are the pecuniary matters – the financial loss of a corn yield – and the interviews with the afflicted.Any large-scale traumatic event, be it a natural disaster or a war will often provoke reminders of previous traumatic episodes; instances that have remained abstract, placeless or locked within the mind. A flood might breach other instances of grief, loss, degradation, violence. It may be the interminable and sour stench of silt and sewage, children’s toys and clothing heaped in brown puddles, humble and cherished items stacked in ruins or the ceaseless clack of helicopters flying low through ashen skies that prompt the return of a painful memory; it could be the sight of broken walls, sagging houses, a wrecked car submerged in mud.Buried by mud and silt, New Zealand’s farms face ‘10-year recovery’ – picture essayRead moreThe national state of emergency in Hawke’s Bay and Tairāwhiti has been extended for a third week to manage the ongoing impact from the flooding event, and for many these past three weeks have been a gruelling blur of endless toil, more rain accompanied by anxiety at a greying sky, sheltering at a marae or elsewhere for an indeterminate period. People speak of the collective trauma that accrues among those caught in limbo, living in close quarters together. A different mode of anxiety settles in, there is a shift in psychology. Dread supplants the immediate panic where, for instance, the week after the flood, water was scarce. Town faucets supplied water only an hour or so a day, and there remains circumspection about the quality of that water. The river as it breached roared through fertiliser plants, farm run-off, garden sheds stacked with hazardous chemicals, and sewage.A flood-damaged house in Wairoa. The New Zealand town was cut off for three days after Cyclone Gabrielle ripped through the region last month. Photograph: Brennan Thomas/The GuardianFour days after the flood, the local council administered its usual daily update – printed on A4 paper given the lack of telecommunications – with a decree to boil all water. All flood water was to be treated as contaminated as the wastewater system was overloaded. Three days after this edict, the update instructed those wading through sludge and silt to wear gloves and long sleeves, and respiratory masks for those blazing days where the mud dried to dust and curdled in the throat, prompting wheezing and a caustic taste in the mouth. Those intervening days between ordinances were, then, higher risk, regarded as more unsafe than was previously understood. Such details are important in consideration of the seeds of distrust planted and circulating within communities during the Covid pandemic. Formal warnings or lack thereof threaten to reinforce mistrust in such a time.The immediate ancillary social issues to the event were not unanticipated – the spike in domestic violence, the sole operational grocery store stating it would not sell alcohol and cigarettes, the fear of theft. “Good job on the yellow stickers,” one man rued, wryly addressing the council in describing the classification that signals a house is not immediately habitable but not condemned and may therefore contain valuables. There was the fraying mental state of those on the frontlines confronting destroyed homes and distressed occupants, tasked with issuing such stickers that sealed the fate of a home’s inhabitants.That there was, for a week, no internet connection allowed for a markedly different experience than might otherwise have transpired. The centre of the town became atypically populated; people converged on the council grounds seeking information, supplies, conversation, hopes of an online connection. It would have been an entirely different experience had there been the internet to scroll for information. There would not be the knitted community that would emerge, the material understanding that our lives are indivisibly linked to one another, notwithstanding the observation levelled from some corners that those milling around the grounds were not – for the most part – covered in mud, were not salvaging their ravaged homes, and it would become, and remain, a point of contention. Comments would be directed at the council and the National Emergency Management Agency, which located water reserves, food and social services on the side of town that had not experienced flooding.A hotel and bottle shop in Wairoa.

Photograph: Brennan Thomas/The GuardianWith no fuel, those on the affected side of town could not necessarily travel to access water with which to clean or drink; when they arrived at a food bank for welfare boxes, they found those reserves scant or emptied. Occupied with urgently rescuing their ruined homes, they were dealt a further blow. Military vehicles rolling through the town and reserves clad in fatigues became a familiar and ambient sight; the sound of choppers collecting and depositing relief and supplies – power generators, water, food – a hopeful if not disquieting brace against the sense of being abandoned. And there were those on far-flung farms or on the outskirts of town also without fuel and supplies, and those still without power, three weeks on.‘Like a tsunami’: the role of forestry waste in New Zealand’s cyclone devastationRead moreA week or so into the disaster it seemed as though half the town was quite suddenly stricken once again with Covid, including the mayor and the primary volunteer leading the response effort at Hinemihi marae. The abrupt confluence of a pandemic and a natural disaster is a modern crisis of the kind theorists and scientists have been predicting for decades. Accordingly, facing twinned events under such conditions prompts ethical and practical questions and problems, and risks, that will ultimately depend upon an individual, not the state, to weigh and to make commensurate decisions and compromises.What this event has offered is a glimpse not only into the daily realities faced by many around the world – how the impoverished and stricken have lived for decades – but a future that has arrived in all its chaos: lack of water, intermittent power, no communications, dwindling, limited or restricted reserves of fuel and food, uninhabitable homes, sudden unemployment, destroyed infrastructure and road networks. The notion of the social contract is removed from its theoretical status in such a time; how thin are those strands that bind us together when the grocery store shelves are bare and no banking technology means those with no cash will go without but for the goodwill of others – particularly when central government cannot intervene at the outset. That requisite moral and ethical choices are required is patent but there is no guarantee one will act in accordance with one’s system of belief under such duress. We may find ourselves surprised, alarmed, by our own thoughts.Anna Rankin is a writer working as a reporter in Wairoa",2023-03-11
Hunger and hope: Africans tell of desperation and innovation as climate summit meets ,"As delegates in Nairobi debate the havoc that climate crisis has wreaked on the continent, we speak to people finding new ways to feed themselves in Kenya, Uganda and South Africa","['Supported by', 'About this content', 'Peter Muiruri', ' in Kenya, ', 'Patience Akumu', ' in Uganda, ', 'Silence Charumbira', ' in South Africa']","African heads of state, ministers, leaders and campaigners are meeting this week in Nairobi for the first climate summit held on the continent. An estimated 30,000 delegates are in the Kenyan capital to debate and lobby governments to keep their commitments to support the people suffering the worst consequences of the climate crisis while contributing the least to its causes.Africa has been hard hit by climate-related extreme weather, fuelling a severe hunger crisis affecting millions. We speak to people about living on the frontline of the crisis in three African countries, and what can be done to mitigate some of the problems.KENYA‘Only God can help us ’: a father laments rising food pricesSitting pensively inside the makeshift shed that serves as his grocery shop, Florencio Okonyo explains how, for close to three decades, he has bought fresh vegetables and other household items at discounted prices before selling them for a slim profit to residents of Lindi village, part of Nairobi’s sprawling Kibera slum.When business was booming, Okonyo, 69, would take home “one or two thousand Kenyan shillings” (£5-£10), which was enough to feed, clothe and educate his four children.Not any more. Dwindling supplies of fresh produce from Toi, the main market in Kibera, means he is unable to restock his stall. Today, only a few oranges, each selling for a paltry 5 shillings, are available; the proceeds are too meagre to feed the family.‘We can’t afford three meals a day’: Florencio Okonyo at his flagging grocery stall in Kibera, Nairobi. Photograph: Peter MuiruriHigh food prices have forced Okonyo to drop rice and milk from the family menu. Half a kilogram (17oz) of rice and 500ml (a pint) of milk sell for 60 shillings each.“We cannot afford three meals a day,” says Okonyo, pointing to a plastic jug of tea that serves as his lunch. “The price of everything has gone up. I just make enough to buy a 2kg packet of maize flour. We even stopped eating bread for breakfast, opting instead for mandazi [cheap fried bread made in the slum].” In Nairobi, a loaf of bread sells for 65 shillings while mandazi sells for 5 shillings a piece.Between March and July, residents largely drawn from Nairobi’s “informal settlements”, as the slums are known, took to the streets to protest about the high cost of living. Okonyo feels disillusioned that nothing came out of those protests. “People only transferred their problems from the house to the streets,” he says.“We hear the government and opposition leaders have agreed to talk, but we are told the rising cost of food is not among the items on the table. Ni Mungu tu [only God can help us now],” he says.‘For a woman, this is economic liberation’: climate-smart farmingWhen Maria Mwiti moved to Mutunyi village, near Isiolo, 20 years ago, she wanted to succeed as a vegetable farmer. But Isiolo is a largely arid region in northern Kenya where 80% of land is “non-arable and used for grazing”, according to a climate-risk profile by Kenya’s agriculture ministry.“It was all bush and dry,” she says. “Wild animals roamed the area, making farming difficult.”Undeterred, Mwiti tried planting maize but harvested nothing as elephants, zebras and warthogs from nearby wildlife conservancies ate her crop before it could mature. “We could not get anything to eat. We fought off the elephants day and night. We were risking our lives,” she says.Ten years ago, she fenced off her parcel of land to keep the animals away, then planted tomatoes on a 2,000 sq metre (half-acre) plot of land, using rainwater collected upstream and brought to her farm through gravity. But water levels were drastically reduced due to the climate-induced drought that has devastated the Horn of Africa for the last four years.“We were advised by our local community project manager to use drip irrigation rather than fill trenches within the garden with water, which was in short supply. Drip irrigation means you only water the specific seedling with regulated amounts. A changing climate has forced us to change our farming methods,” says Mwiti.‘I used to be hired but now I can hire’: Maria Mwiti tends her tomatoes on her farm near Isiolo, Kenya. Photograph: Peter MuiruriShe has been attending farming seminars in the agricultural heartland of central Kenya to learn about best farming practices, including the right use of pesticides. The nearby Lewa wildlife conservancy helped her analyse her soil to determine the best tomato variety to plant.“I resorted to planting a fast-growing hybrid tomato that yields more. I used to harvest four crates twice a week but have since doubled the amount, earning 4,000 shillings a crate, up from 1,500. I can earn 300,000 shillings [£1,600] in a good season,” says Mwiti.She and her family can now buy food from the proceeds of tomato farming. She also has 11 cows that produce up to 60 litres of milk a day. She still plants maize, but for use as silage to feed the cows.“Without the climate-smart agriculture, my family would still be food insecure,” she says. “I would keep on asking for handouts from my husband.“I used to be hired, but now I can hire five women in a day to help me on the small farm,” she adds. “For a woman, this is economic liberation.” Peter MuiruriUGANDA‘We share the little we have’: scratching a living from the landJosephine Nantongo’s home is a monument to survival. On her tiny plot in Kabaganda, a suburb of Kampala, she tries to rear goats, rabbits and chickens and grows bananas and vegetables. It is the only way she can survive in the face of rising food prices in the Ugandan capital.“I could have given you entula [the Thai round eggplant also known as “garden eggs”] to take home but the rains were delayed, and they all died out,” she says apologetically as she uses a stick to poke avocados from a tree before sitting down to dinner with her family. Dinner is silver fish, also known as mukene, and cassava.“Today is a good day,” she says. “Sometimes, when my business has not worked out, we simply take porridge and go to bed.”More than four months of harsh sun has made her vegetable plot dry up. Her chicken died of disease and, two months ago, thieves broke in and stole her goats.Nantongo goes from house to house selling clothes. Every day, it becomes more difficult to knock at people’s doors. “Nobody has money any more. Even the people I could have sold to are struggling. We used to buy 12 pieces of matoke [plantain-like green bananas] at 1,000 [Ugandan] shillings [21p] but now we only get eight for the same amount,” she says.“Just a few months ago, a kilogram of posho [maize flour] was at 2,800 shillings. Now it is nearly double that.”‘Today is a good day’: Josephine Nantongo eats a meagre dinner with her children. Rising food prices and an erratic rainy season have left them on the breadline. Photograph: Patience AkumuThe UN World Food Programme’s monthly market monitor for Uganda indicates that, for major food items such as maize flour, prices are far higher than at the same time last year. For instance, the average price for beans in July is 45% greater than July 2022.“Sometimes the neighbours have nothing to eat, and we must share the little we have,” says Nantongo, as she dips a piece of cassava into silver-fish stew and gives it to a child who has wandered into the house with her two-year-old daughter.If a neighbour has a good harvest of potatoes, she will bring it home and share with everyone within the fenced compound. If a relative from the village visits and brings fruit, it would be unjust to eat the fruit alone, knowing your neighbour might be hungry, she says.Nalongo Gloria, who owns the nearby grocery shop, understands the predicament of her neighbours well. “When everything fails, you go to Nalongo and get some food on credit,” Nantongo says. “Then you pray to God that you find the money to pay for it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Global DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He is the headteacher of Jubilee community secondary school in Karenga in north-eastern Uganda’s Karamoja region, which has for decades registered high levels of poverty and food insecurity.Last year, Dominique received a lifeline: the school received a grant from the Novo Nordisk Foundation and World Food Programme to expand the small garden where it grew orange-fleshed sweet potatoes into a plot big enough to feed both the school and wider community.“Orange-fleshed sweet potatoes were an easy option,” says Dominique. “They are nutritious, drought-resistant and take only three months to mature.“We knew that everyone would be able to grow some at home, rather than faraway gardens, and the plants would be safe from wild animals. These potatoes do not need a lot of land.”Students, teachers and a healthy crop of sweet potatoes at the Jubilee community secondary school in Karenga, Uganda. Photograph: Patience AkumuThe potatoes, fortified with vitamin A, which boosts immunity and improves vision, are now grown on more than 3 hectares (8 acres) of land. The school recently built an irrigation system to ensure they can harvest all year.Students plant and tend the potatoes, and operate the irrigation system themselves. Another 3 hectares of school land is used to grow potatoes they sell to the community, and a smaller plot is used as a nursery for replanting potato vines.When there is plenty of rain, usually in March and April, the school can harvest 10 bags of potatoes a day – enough to feed the entire school and leave a surplus. School staff boil the fresh potatoes and serve them with beans, and use the boiled potato leaves as a green vegetable. Surplus potatoes are dried in the sun and stored for the dry months when the harvest is leaner.“There was a time when there was no rain and no food for months, but the sweet potatoes survived and so did we,” says Dominique.“Our focus is now on teaching our children how to grow these potatoes because we know that at home there is [sometimes] no food. It is important that children learn resilient methods of farming.” Patience AkumuSOUTH AFRICALaid off at work: ‘Now it’s bread for breakfast, lunch and dinner’It’s 10am, and Christabell Mhurushomana, 40, pours herself a glass of Mazoe orange cordial, then sits on the couch in her apartment in Tembisa township, just outside Johannesburg. The loaf of bread on the table in front of her could be her only meal today if she does not land a house-cleaning job.‘I can no longer afford decent food’: former store manager Christabell Mhurushomana at home near Johannesburg. Photograph: Silence CharumbiraBefore June 2022, Mhurushomana was a manager at a local chain store and could afford any food she wanted. She was laid off when the company downsized and now survives on menial household jobs in Midrand, a suburb of the city.Why rich nations must pour climate funds into Africa – for all our sakesRead more“I can no longer afford to buy decent foods like meat – the best that I can do for protein is eggs,” says Mhurushomana, a widow with two children. “Even the bread I now eat costs just 6 rand (25p) and it must be my breakfast, lunch and dinner for two days unless I get money to buy mealie meal [ground maize] and eggs or vegetables,” she says.On a good day, she makes just 350 rand, but such good days are rare. With a kilogram of beef now costing at least 90 rand (up from about 50 rand a year ago), Mhurushomana makes do with whatever she can afford each day.And when it comes to work, she must compete with close to 100 other women who are in a similar position and going after the same jobs.‘We could beat climate change’: the rise of regenerative farmingOn his farm, Danie Bester talks with passion about the techniques that have doubled his yields while slashing costs. He took up “regenerative” farming on Rietbult Estates farm, about 60 miles from Johannesburg, a decade ago and believes it could be the answer to the climate crisis for farmers.‘Yields have doubled’: Danie Bester with a radish grown using regenerative farming methods. Photograph: Bongani Siziba“Education [and] improved uptake of regenerative farming could beat climate change,” says Bester, from Mpumalanga province in eastern South Africa.Regenerative farming is about preserving the land naturally by keeping soil covered and disturbed as little as possible, replacing artificial fertilisers with manure and animal urine, and diversifying crops.Since making the transition in 2012, Bester says his maize, soya bean and sunflower yields have nearly doubled, while the costs of farming inputs have drastically fallen.South Africa, like many other African countries that rely heavily on agriculture, had its most brutal drought in three decades in 2014 and 2015. With temperatures continuing to rise and rainfall patterns shifting due to the climate crisis, Bester thinks it is imperative to educate farmers and encourage more of them to shift to this new method.A recently harvested maize field at Rietbult Estates, showing a cover crop that is left to grow naturally to protect the soil. Photograph: Danie Bester“With regenerative farming, you get a more productive soil because it retains more moisture and enhances its ability to feed the crops. There is exponential reduction of inputs because the soil starts to provide better fertility on its own. For the last decade, my maize yields have grown from 4.7 tonnes to 11 tonnes per hectare,” says Bester.Other costs have also been reduced: Bester once used 450kg of fertiliser a year for his land but now needs only 280kg. “There are so many advantages, including immense moisture retention.” This, he adds, is vital, “with big droughts increasingly likely every other year”.

 How to turn England’s rivers from filthy sewers into shining streamsRachel Salvidge,"None of our rivers meet the legal standard for health, and communities are starting to take matters into their own hands",,"I wouldn’t go swimming in England’s rivers, in the same way that I wouldn’t flush my head down a public toilet. It’s not just me who feels this way. Even Sir James Bevan, the chief executive of the Environment Agency – the regulator responsible for protecting and improving water in England – has said he would be “cautious” about it, first seeking out assurances by checking the websites of the EA and the campaign group Surfers Against Sewage before going for a paddle.Bevan’s agency does provide some assurances – as long as you only wish to swim in one of the country’s 417 or so designated bathing water sites, most of which are at the coast. In fact, there are only around a dozen inland bathing lakes in the whole country; and, for now, just one river – in Ilkley, West Yorkshire – which was rated “poor” in the agency’s last assessment of bathing water, so you might want to avoid it anyway. Better to hop across the Channel instead, where France can offer around 1,300 glorious lakes and rivers designated for safe swimming among its 3,300 bathing sites.The main reason Defra, which sponsors the EA, is loth to greenlight river swimming is that sewage, farm, urban and industrial pollution is so widespread that all of England’s rivers failed to meet the legal standard for overall health the last time they were assessed. It’s not the EA’s fault though, according to the agency. It has pleaded poverty over the abysmal state of our watercourses, stating that “you get the environment you pay for” and calling for more government funding to enable it to nobble polluters and do its job properly.So where does that leave the wild swimmers, the boaters, the anglers and pretty much anyone who would prefer to stroll alongside a shining stream than an open sewer? Sensing abandonment by the agency – compounded by its recent moves to stop attending “low-impact” pollution incidents and the low morale of staff who say they are no longer able to deter polluters – communities have begun to take matters into their own hands. It appears, at first glance, as though it is working.It began last year when the people of the Ilkley Clean River Group in West Yorkshire succeeded in getting a stretch of the River Wharfe, already popular with swimmers, designated as an official bathing water site. Situated downstream of a sewage treatment works, the group knew the water would not be safe and concluded that a bathing designation was the only way to oblige the Environment Agency to install a water quality monitor and acknowledge the level of pollution there. After a bizarre scrap to get the agency to locate the monitor downstream of the sewage works rather than in the cleaner water upstream, that stretch of the Wharfe officially became the first river bathing water in England, albeit one with poor water quality.A year on and we now have a grand total of two river bathing sites: thanks to the efforts of the Thames21 charity, a stretch of the River Thames in Oxford will also be granted bathing water status next month.France we are not, but could these two sites signal the first green shoots of a wider society-led movement to clean up our rivers?The Rivers Trust and Surfers Against Sewage (SAS) campaign groups hope so. Together they’ve compiled a map showing 273 popular river recreation spots, including some where there is already community interest in setting up a bathing water designation, such as Warleigh Weir on the River Avon and Sheep’s Green on the River Cam. SAS has also launched a petition calling for Defra to create 200 new bathing sites by 2030.Bagging a bathing water site is relatively straightforward, according to Thames21. For anyone embarking on the process, it recommends convening river users, picking a popular spot with access and facilities, researching pollution risks, logging the number of people using the river during the May-September bathing season, getting the landowner’s permission, raising public awareness and then making a formal application to Defra. It sounds simple, but Prof Becky Malby from the Ilkley Clean River Group points out that there is no transparency over Defra’s decision-making and that it takes around two years to complete the whole process – time which, in their case, would have been better spent fixing sewage spills from the nearby water firm’s pipes.This is what ‘cutting red tape’ gets you: rivers polluted without consequence | John VidalRead moreSo we’re in (at best) muddy waters. Clearly, the growing bathing water movement is positive and the associated public awareness is critical if things are to improve, but it doesn’t get anywhere near addressing the problem of chronic and widespread river pollution. A couple of Environment Agency tests for two types of bacteria taken at one site during the bathing season doesn’t even begin to scratch the surface of the number of pollutants flowing through our beauty spots, or the consequent risks to people and wildlife.What we need are wholesale improvements to entire catchments made by tougher regulation of the biggest polluters: the water industry and agriculture. A few bathing designations on a river in a catchment that is inundated with sewage pollution or choked by farm fertilisers will not be enough to make swimming safe.

 ‘They look like waves’: spider webs blanket Gippsland after Victorian floods,"Flooded roads and paddocks disrupt local spiders which seek higher ground on road signs, trees and any tall grass they can find",['Matilda Boseley'],"Residents in eastern Victoria have been taken aback after waking up to vast, alien-like sheets of spider webs laying across paddocks and roadsides.The East Gippsland town of Traralgon was one of the hardest-hit areas by recent flooding and wild weather. While its neighbour Sale avoided the brunt of the damage, flooded roads and paddocks disrupted the local spider populations, which are now seeking higher ground on road signs, trees and any tall grass they can find.“It’s just incredible, when they blow in the winds they look like waves,” said Jena Beatson, who saw the spiders on her first trip into Sale from Longford after the roads were cut off by flood waters.“It does look creepy the way it covers all the signs and everything. You can’t really see it in the photos but there are spiders all over. It’s like thousands and thousands of spiders.”Actually, according to Dr Ken Walker, a senior curator of entomology at the Melbourne Museum, it is millions.Allow Facebook content?This article includes content provided by Facebook.

Spiders can make a wide range of different silks and one of the silks they use for this behaviour – ballooning – it’s a very, very thin little silk that they use … to fly away with the breeze. They could fly 100km,” he said.“What’s happened is there’s been a massive flooding event pretty quickly … so they’re using the ballooning not to escape for hundreds of kilometres but to almost throw up a lasso on top of the vegetation. It hooks on to the tops of the vegetation because it’s lighter than air, and then they quickly climb up.”

When a huge number of spiders all do this at once, they end up hooking on to each other and can blanket the countryside.This phenomenon, sometimes called the gossamer effect, is caused by “vagrant hunter” spider species, which live on the ground and do not build a web. They also do not create webs after ballooning away from a flood. In fact, Walker said, each spider only threw up a single thread, meaning every tiny line of silk represented a different animal.“I would say millions of spiders [in the photos online],” he said.Allow Facebook content?This article includes content provided by Facebook.

We just normally don’t see them because they’re under vegetation, on the leaves, under bark and things like that,” he said.Thousands of spiders, including the red and black Ambicodamus species, have created large webs after the Victoria floods.

Walker said people should not be worried though, as none of the highly venomous species would make up part of the net.“It’s not dangerous at all. Most of these spiders, their fangs are probably too short to penetrate the human skin.”Thousands remain without power in Victoria days after deadly stormRead moreLocals from all around Sale had been coming out to look at the spiders, Beatson said.“It’s actually not a great drive at the moment, because everybody’s stopping and pulling over the side of the road to take photos,” she laughed.But these blankets of silk will not last long.“These threads are so thin, usually as soon as the first breeze comes along, they get quickly broken up and dispersed,” Walker said, encouraging those in the area to enjoy them while they lasted.“[Across Victoria] we only really see it about once a year … It’s a beautiful event and it’s something that’s quite rare.”",2021-06-15
After the fall: what a garden might look like at the end of the world,"‘Post-apocalypse’ is not a typical theme for a garden show, but in Melbourne, landscape architects planted out a climate change worst-case scenario

",['Liz Crash'],"Abandoned by humans, no longer inhabitable, a typical suburban Melbourne home sinks into a marshland – perhaps it was caused by flooding, or rising sea levels. A wild entanglement of vegetation creeps around and over the built structures, a forest of self-seeded garden escapers.Or that’s the plan, anyway. At this stage, the exhibit is not so much a garden as a construction site from a builder’s anxiety dream. On 31 March, it will be ready for the Melbourne International Flower and Garden Show in Carlton Gardens. The installation, titled Coming Soon, is a showcase garden by Akas Landscape Architecture and Nrth Landscapes, exploring a possible future for Melbourne’s suburban yards.The corner, and only the corner, of a weatherboard house is tilted jauntily over a pile of bluestone rubble – volcanic basalt, the characteristic bedrock of Melbourne’s lava plains in the west and north. Over the next week, hundreds of potted trees, shrubs, and grasses will be moved in, tucked under soil and mulch to suggest a garden abandoned for decades.The garden designers Ryan Parker, Anthony Sharples and Alistair Kirkpatrick. Photograph: Ellen Smith/The GuardianThe exhibit was planned for the 2020 show, and then delayed twice due to Covid-19. Yet it looks eerily like images from the devastating recent floods in Queensland – close enough that another exhibitor called it “a little bit in bad taste, considering what’s going on”.“Well, I think it’s in very bad taste for the government not to act on climate change,” says Akas co-director Alistair Kirkpatrick, with a touch of acerbity. He’s joined by other co-director, Anthony Sharples.So which plants have they chosen as likely survivors of a climate catastrophe that forces humans to flee?“A lot of the plants that we have in there are already really commonly used garden plants, which was intentional,” says Sharples. “Native, indigenous [native to the Melbourne region] and exotic plants – we wanted to use all three. If the landscape is left to its own devices, plants are going to form a new ecology. We’re going to have so many houseplant escapees, and so many different types of plants meshing together. All the plants that we’ve chosen, we’ve seen actually growing in abandoned gardens in Melbourne.”Australian native violets that are planted in the garden. Photograph: Ellen Smith/The GuardianTrees like silver dollar gum (Eucalyptus cinerea), gingko (Ginkgo biloba) and coastal tea tree (Leptospermum laevigatum) will be packed thickly over typical council-approved shrubs and grasses like lomandra (Lomandra longifolia) and miscanthus (Miscanthus oligostachyus). The heaviest shade will provide shelter for tender carpet bugle (Ajuga reptans) and native Australian violets (Viola hederacea). And there’s a smattering of old-fashioned favourites like ginger lily (Hedychium gardnerianum) and lamb’s ears (Stachys byzantina).Kirkpatrick suggests that the distinction between “native” and “introduced” plants might not always hold up to close scientific scrutiny.“Dr Angela Moles did this incredible study on Arctotheca calendula [cape dandelion], a South African weed. She’s found that it was so genetically divergent from its South African counterpart, that from a scientific perspective, it actually was an Australian native species. So I think we need to move beyond that binary.”Meanwhile, Nrth Landscaping are finishing up the new-old house, a process that’s required some creative problem-solving.To create the effect of peeling paint, landscaper Ryan Parker coated brand new boards with slippery lanolin, then painted without waiting for them to dry between coats – everything you’re not supposed to do. On the roof, carpenter Danny hammers rusty roofing nails at deliberately odd angles.The result is uncannily decrepit.The house’s corrugated iron roofing and sash window were found in salvage. Photograph: Ellen Smith/The Guardian“We just bought all these materials in the name of sustainability, so we’re kind of contradicting ourselves, but as long as they can be hacked out and [we can] do it again in a way that can be unveiled and unpacked and taken to somewhere …” Parker shrugs.In fact, the weatherboard is one of few things bought new for the project, with the house’s corrugated iron roofing and sash window found in salvage.As sustainable gardens grow more popular, clients are more open to recycled materials, and prefer a less rigidly controlled aesthetic.“A lot of people will say that they want to go out into their garden, they want it to feel like their own little oasis, and they want it to feel overgrown,” says Sharples.But it’s a difficult balancing act: when sustainability is in fashion, it runs the risk of being reduced to an aesthetic. What can gardeners do to make sure sustainability is more than a vibe?Sharples’s answer is immediate: build a pond.“Water is the heart of the garden. It keeps the space cool. It brings animals and biodiversity into the garden. And it’s so relaxing to sit next to a pond.”Volcanic basalt boulders around the pond; Anthony Sharples encourages gardeners to build ponds to attract animals and biodiversity. Photograph: Ellen Smith/The GuardianWhat about renters, and people in small spaces? Is it possible for me to have a water feature on my tiny balcony, I ask?“Yes, absolutely!” says Sharples. Any large, wide-mouthed vessel that holds water, he says, can be a pond, provided it’s big enough for fish (to keep down mosquito larvae), and aquatic plants (to keep the fish happy). But even a simple bird bath can be a lifeline for birds and native bees on hot days.

Australian ecosystems have changed rapidly; an introduced plant might now provide a critical resource for native animals, especially if native food sources or nesting sites have decreased. Dense shrubbery is especially important for small native birds.Ultimately, the team hope the exhibit inspires people to build not just fish ponds, but political momentum.“If we don’t have radical action on climate change immediately,” says Kirkpatrick, “this is what’s coming soon.”“And the world will be fine. But we won’t.”

 Treasury blocking green policies key to UK net zero target,Experts say chancellor refusing to commit spending needed to shift economy to low-carbon footing,"['Fiona Harvey', ' Environment correspondent']","The Treasury is blocking green policies essential to put the UK on track to net zero emissions, imperilling the UK’s own targets and the success of vital UN climate talks, experts have told the Guardian.A string of policies, from home insulation to new infrastructure spending, have been scrapped, watered down or delayed. Rows about short term costs have dominated over longer term warnings that putting off green spending now will lead to much higher costs in future.The UK’s credibility as host of the Cop26 climate talks this November in Glasgow rests on a clear net zero strategy – but publication has been postponed until near the eve of the summit, giving the UK little leverage to bring other countries to the negotiating table with the tougher carbon targets needed. Meanwhile, steep cuts to overseas aid have severely damaged the UK’s standing internationally, experts on the UN talks said.Jamie Peters, director of campaigning impact at Friends of the Earth, said: “The Treasury has been helping to fuel the climate emergency for far too long. The reality is that a rapid transition to a zero carbon future would be far less expensive than delaying the green measures we so urgently need, and that will create significant economic opportunities and new jobs.”Civil society groups, thinktanks and political insiders said the Treasury had refused to commit to the spending needed to shift the UK’s economy to a low-carbon footing. Complaints about the potential short-term costs of net zero policies have been one flashpoint during weeks of high tension between the prime minister, Boris Johnson, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, the Guardian understands.Once you understand the terrible cost of doing nothing, climate action is a bargain | Damian CarringtonRead moreKate Blagojevic, head of climate at Greenpeace UK, said: “There are strong reports that Rishi Sunak is intent on blocking climate spending at exactly the moment we need it most, and that his fingerprints sit heavily on moves to delay or block crucial investment to cut emissions from buildings or gas boilers.”The lengthy charge sheet against the Treasury includes: scrapping the green homes grant insulation scheme; freezing fuel duty while slashing electric car incentives; mulling cuts to air passenger duty on domestic flights, while making above-inflation train fare increases; failing to cut VAT on green home refurbishment; underfunding the new infrastructure bank; and delaying the phasing out of gas boilers.There have also been glaring omissions and delays. For instance, the transport strategy failed to back road pricing, which many believe will be essential to reducing emissions, which have remained stubbornly high as more people buy SUVs. Both the hydrogen strategy and heat and buildings strategy have been delayed until autumn, as has the overarching net zero strategy.Not all of these policies were under direct Treasury control, but the Treasury holds the purse strings and can effectively veto plans by other departments that require government investment or might raise costs for consumers. “The Treasury is at the root of this,” said Ed Matthew, campaign director at E3G, a green thinktank. “They are completely obsessed with short-term costs. It’s bonkers.”Chris Venables, head of politics at the Green Alliance thinktank, said: “The Treasury has this huge institutional resistance to medium term economic benefits [that entail short term costs]. They have to be dragged kicking and screaming to consider it.”Ministers and advisers are understood to be anxious that costs such as switching to heat pumps from gas boilers, estimated from £5,000 to £20,000 for some households, or the higher purchase price of electric cars, will hurt consumers’ pockets. But the independent committee on climate change has said the costs of net zero are affordable and falling, at about 1% of GDP by 2050, while green investment will generate new jobs, and policies can be devised that shift the costs from lower-income households and distribute them fairly.Moreover, as this week’s report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change spelled out, extreme weather is already here and will get worse. As recent flooding has demonstrated, the costs of inaction will far outweigh the costs of action.Even observers normally sympathetic to the government find the Treasury’s reluctance concerning. Josh Buckland, author of a report for the liberal conservative thinktank Bright Blue, said: “The Treasury is absolutely crucial to net zero. It has taken some welcome steps thus far to drive green finance and investment, but the jury is still out on how far it is willing to go given wider pressures on the public finances.”Buckland, a former environmental adviser to Johnson, believes that Sunak, known to be a fiscal “hawk” and free-marketeer, is not ideologically opposed to climate action. He said that while the Treasury was traditionally reluctant to commit spending on any issue, Sunak “also has a lot of priorities as we recover from the pandemic”.Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, disagrees. “Their ideology is standing in the way – they think that it can be done by the market and it can’t. They are held back by thinking this can all be done by the private sector, when all the evidence is that this has to be done by the public and private sectors.”Recent calls by Conservative MPs including Steve Baker and Craig Mackinlay to halt the race to net zero, which have received a warm welcome in sections of the press, have suggested that some MPs may also sniff electoral advantage in being seen to be anti-green.Scientists issue a climate code redRead moreBlagojevic said: “The chancellor’s position may be politically expedient for him in trying to court the small number of Tory MPs intent on delaying climate action. Ultimately, though, history will not look kindly if he is the chancellor who tried to hobble our chances of reaching a low-carbon future, with all the growth, good jobs and stable better future it offers.”If the UK is to meet its net zero targets, ministers will have to face down backbench critics. E3G’s Matthew said: “It’s becoming understood [by the government] that you can’t just leave it to the market to deliver net zero, as that isn’t going to happen. For a Conservative government, that’s an inconvenient reality.”Last year, as the world was plunged into recession after the first lockdowns, Johnson appeared to grasp this when he promised to “build back greener”. Since then, however, few spending plans to reduce emissions have been brought forward, other than the green homes grant. Johnson also produced a 10-point plan setting out areas of focus, including nuclear power and offshore wind, but this was dismissed by many experts as a wishlist rather than a strategy.The Treasury said: “The government is committed to tackling climate change and the prime minister has set out an ambitious 10-point plan to help us achieve that. The Treasury is playing a crucial role in this effort, by allocating £12bn to fund the 10-point plan, setting up the UK infrastructure bank to invest in net zero, and announcing plans to issue £15bn in green bonds over the next year.”As the UK prepares to host Cop26, the government will be trying to persuade other countries to set out clear policies on emissions cuts for the next decade, a task much harder if ministers have no policies of their own. Ultimately, says Venables, only one person can sort this out: “The prime minister needs to get stuck in, to make the difficult decisions, and soon.”",2018-07-05
 China’s top climate official urges US to ‘clear barriers’ to talks,"US-China relations hit new low this year after Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, over which China claims sovereignty
 Cop27 live – latest news updates","['Fiona Harvey', ' in Sharm el-Sheikh']","China’s top climate official has said the US must take responsibility for any reconciliation between the two countries at the Cop27 climate summit, calling on the US to “clear the barriers” to talks.Xie Zhenhua, the climate envoy for China, said he had met John Kerry, the US special presidential envoy for climate, in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, where governments and world leaders have gathered for a fortnight of talks on the climate crisis.He said: “It is the responsibility of the US. We hope the US will take the initiative, to clear the barriers. I think the door was absolutely closed by them. We in China are trying to open it.“We have already started informal conversations with the US. We, with John Kerry, have a joint effort to support the Egyptian presidency, and have a successful Cop27.”Relations between the world’s two biggest emitters hit a new low this summer after the US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, visited the disputed island of Taiwan, over which China claims sovereignty. The diplomatic deep freeze has cast a shadow over the already fraught climate talks.Both sides have made conciliatory remarks, but there is still no formal rapprochement. Before Xie spoke to a small group of mostly Chinese media on Wednesday, Kerry told an event: “I’ve spoken, but we’re not having any formal meetings. You know I’ve made the argument to the Chinese publicly, I’ll make the same argument to you today, it’s nothing different.“This is not a bilateral issue. It’s a global threat to the planet. And we need to be talking to each other because we’re the two biggest economies in the world and we’re the two biggest emitters in the world. And we have a common interest in working together to try to reduce emissions and be leaders on this level. So the answer is: I’ve said to China many times publicly, and President Joe Biden has indicated to them, that we are open to resuming climate [talks] and hope that we’ll be able to.”Xie and Kerry have previously enjoyed a productive relationship. Last year at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow, the pair unveiled a surprise pact to cooperate on cutting emissions, including ways to reduce the potent greenhouse gas methane.Xie said: “But just as everything was going well, Nancy Pelosi invaded Chinese sovereignty, and hurt the Chinese people’s feelings. That was against the spirit of the joint communique [signed at Glasgow].”Xie also hinted that China was “supportive” of developing country attempts to ensure a flow of funds to help them with the loss and damage they suffer from the climate crisis. Loss and damage, which refers to the devastation wreaked on vulnerable countries by extreme weather, is one of the most contentious issues at the talks. Poor countries have accused the rich of causing the climate crisis while leaving them to bear the brunt of the damage unaided.China could participate in helping to fund efforts in other developing countries, Xie said. “There is not an obligation on China [to contribute funds] but we are willing to make our contribution … China has already been doing that, [providing] help to other developing countries. Our attitude [to loss and damage] is very supportive and understanding.”He also praised the “inclusive and constructive attitude” towards loss and damage at the talks. “We strongly support the concerns from developing countries, especially the most vulnerable countries, for addressing loss and damage because China is also a developing country and we also suffered a lot from extreme weather events,” Xie said, speaking through a translator. “It is not the obligation of China to provide financial support under the UNFCCC.”A senior developed country diplomat told the Guardian that Xie’s words should not be interpreted as indicating China’s willingness to pay into a formal loss and damage fund, of the kind that developing countries are demanding.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The UK said it would allow some debt payment deferrals for countries hit by climate disasters, while Austria and New Zealand put forward funding for loss and damage, which is the cost of rebuilding in poorer nations after unavoidable climate impacts.For the US, Kerry unveiled a new voluntary carbon trading market scheme with the aim of boosting private investment in clean energy projects in developing countries. Kerry said the new initiative, called the energy transition accelerator, will be created in partnership with the Rockefeller Foundation and the Bezos Earth Fund to help deliver trillions of dollars of investment.For many of the countries that require climate finance, one of the key issues emerging at Cop27 has been calls for reform of the World Bank. The Guardian asked the president of the bank, David Malpass, whether he denied the science of climate change. He was unwilling to respond.World leaders had largely left the conference by Wednesday afternoon, leaving their negotiating teams to continue the talks into next week. There are still divisions between developed and developing countries over how to approach loss and damage, but participants said the talks were going well.",2022-11-09
" This article is more than 1 month oldSellafield nuclear site workers claim ‘toxic culture’ of bullying, sexual harassment and drugs could put safety at riskThis article is more than 1 month old","Exclusive: Multiple sources warn poor working culture heightens risk of accidents, suicide and sabotage

UK nuclear police and workers share WhatsApp jokes about paedophilia, racism and homophobia
Sellafield nuclear site hacked by groups linked to Russia and China
","['Alex Lawson', ' and ', 'Anna Isaac']","A “toxic culture” of bullying, sexual harassment and drug-taking risks compromising the safety of Europe’s most hazardous nuclear site, multiple employees at Sellafield have claimed.More than a dozen current and former employees have alleged to the Guardian that the Cumbrian site, a vast dump for nuclear waste, has a longstanding unhealthy working culture, where staff have been bullied, harassed and belittled, with some apparently pushed to suicide.The site’s human resources department has been accused of taking a “bully, break, bribe” approach to dealing with employees who raise concerns over their colleagues and site safety.Sellafield whistleblower: ‘employees said it was not safe to speak out’ - videoWhistleblowers warn that the toxic culture could have dangerous consequences for safety and security at Europe’s biggest nuclear waste dump, which hosts decades of radioactive material. The revelations have emerged as part of Nuclear Leaks, a year-long Guardian investigation into cyber hacking, radioactive contamination and toxic workplace culture at the 6 sq km (2 sq mile) site.A whistleblower, Alison McDermott, a consultant who said she was sacked in 2018 after raising concerns over Sellafield’s culture and sexual harassment, warned that this climate heightens the risk of not just accidents and mistakes, but also terrorism and sabotage.“Those risks are far more likely to materialise if you’re working in a highly toxic and dysfunctional culture,” she claimed.The vast taxpayer-funded site employs 11,000 staff, who are tasked with making safe crumbling buildings containing nuclear waste. It is one of the biggest employers in the north-west, with generations of the same families working there.The investigation into Sellafield has found:
Several suicides apparently linked to the pressures of working at the site.
A former young worker who claimed he was bullied to the point where he “just wanted to die” after he was repeatedly mocked over his sexual experience.
Workers who alleged they have either experienced or witnessed incidents of sexual assault.
Staff who allegedly regularly bring cocaine on to the site and keep samples of untainted urine in case of random drugs tests.
A 2020 report published by the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR), which monitors the site, warned that an unhealthy work culture played a part in the biggest-ever nuclear disasters, including Chornobyl in 1986 and Fukushima in 2011.The report stated: “The role of organisational culture in maintaining nuclear safety is well established: reports of investigation into notable events such as Three Mile Island, Chornobyl, Davis-Besse and Fukushima provide compelling evidence of the importance of establishing an effective nuclear safety culture.”Sellafield is one of the dominant employers in the west Cumbria region, together with BAE Systems, which makes Britain’s nuclear submarines in nearby Barrow-in-Furness, paying salaries that are typically higher than the regional average. Generations of families are heavily dependent on Sellafield for work and sources said that alternative employment is difficult to find for those who leave after attempting to raise concerns.Sellafield is one of the dominant employers in the west Cumbria region. Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianIt is understood that several suicides have been linked to the pressures of working at the site in recent years.Sources with knowledge of medical services at the site claimed that there have been a disproportionately high number of severe mental ill-health episodes, suicides and suicide attempts among the workforce.The wider Cumbria region has a suicide rate that is 50% higher than the average in England. While there is no official data on the number of suicides linked to the site, a source claimed the rate at Sellafield is even higher. Sellafield declined to confirm whether it has records of suicides among its employees.“You have to consider Sellafield and the surroundings in the same way you might an army base and its host town,” said a source with medical knowledge of the site. “The level of risk of suicide or intense mental ill-health in hothouse conditions like this is higher, as any issue at work is also a social issue in an area like this. People often feel they can’t escape.“Sellafield workers are a high risk group for suicide, and the numbers, while too small for statistical analysis, suggest that it has an outsized suicide and mental health problem for its worker population.”Some current and former staff say they have felt the sense of being in a “goldfish bowl” where they are unable to leave the site behind in rural communities after finishing their working day.There are also concerns over claims of bullying. A source who began working at a young age for a contractor on the site has described how colleagues routinely “picked away at me to find out my biggest vulnerabilities”. In a written account, seen by the Guardian, the young worker said he was called a “virgin”, a “faggot” and a “pussy” and was mockingly given the name “top shagger” as colleagues speculated about his sexual experience.“My confidence sunk to an all-time low and they made me feel that I wasn’t worthy of being a human being and I just wanted to die,” he wrote. “It’s now almost four years on – I am not even close to recovering physically and mentally.”He also alleged that colleagues would regularly bring cocaine on to the site and that some “even kept samples of their urine in case of a drugs test”.Several other sources at the site have questioned the effectiveness of the drug testing regime at the site.Last year, it emerged that seven workers tested positive for drugs after 741 workers were randomly tested between November 2021 and November 2022.There are also concerns about allegations of racist, misogynistic and other troubling behaviour at Sellafield. In late 2020, a network of ethnic minority employees wrote to the company’s board, listing 27 alleged racist incidents.A senior industry source said that a hardcore of longstanding Sellafield employees who are resistant to change are known as “We Bees” – short for “we be here when you be gone”.A former employee said: “There is zero staff turnover, and often three generations of the same family are working on site. Everyone sees it as a job for life and it is a very insular community. When you are trying to change that mentality it is very difficult and challenging.”Multiple sources described the response from the human resources department to those who spoke out as “bully, break, bribe”. Sellafield did not comment on the allegation.In a report prepared for the NDA in 2019 by consultants at PwC, and seen by the Guardian, one employee said: “I feel like I’m punished by HR when I stand up and report bad behaviour.”Alison McDermott alleges she was fired after telling managers that an investigation should be carried out into sexual harassment claims. Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianMcDermott, an experienced HR consultant who has consulted for a range of blue-chip organisations, was brought in to identify issues with Sellafield’s culture and make recommendations. However, she alleges she was fired after telling managers that an investigation should be carried out into claims of sexual harassment and a subsequent cover-up. She is awaiting a decision on her case from the court of appeal after a lengthy legal battle with Sellafield.McDermott said: “The gravity of the bullying and harassment and the abuse employees were being subjected to was just really shocking and off the scale and there clearly was an endemic problem with bullying and harassment at Sellafield.”McDermott, an equality consultant, has spoken to scores of current and former employees before and after she was let go in 2018. She raised concerns over claims of sexual harassment by an employee and allegations of a subsequent cover-up at Sellafield.“Employees said to me that because it was not safe to speak out that they had learned just to keep their heads down and look away just to survive but a survival mentality is not what you want at a nuclear plant because even one mistake, just one mistake, can set off a chain of reactions which could have catastrophic consequences – as we’ve seen with Chornobyl.“Trust is the cornerstone, it’s the absolute bedrock of safety in any organisation – if employees are demoralised and scared to speak out or are being treated really badly then it will have a direct impact on safety.“The risks at Sellafield, they’re not just confined to the risks of an accident or a mistake – as serious as that could be – there are other really serious risks at Sellafield such as acts of terrorism, or even deliberate sabotage. And obviously those risks are far more likely to materialise if you’re working in a highly toxic and dysfunctional culture.”She added: “[The legal battle] has cost me financially and impacted my health.”In a 2018 report of a call to the Safecall whistleblowing hotline, a manager was accused of sexually harassing women for several years. “This has been covered up and not actioned,” the employee claimed.In response to a freedom of information request, Sellafield said it had spent £724,481.82 in the past five years defending employment-related matters.Email anna.isaac@theguardian.com or alex.lawson@theguardian.comA Sellafield spokesperson said: “There is no place for bullying and harassment at Sellafield. We do not tolerate it and where we find it, we take action. If anyone has information related to employee misconduct we urge them to come forward so we can investigate.“We’re committed to ensuring all of our employees are respected, included, and able to perform at their best.“We regularly seek the views of our workforce, and it was a survey in 2018 that brought focus to concerns about bullying and harassment.“We confronted the issue, proactively shared information with employees, and developed a company-wide improvement programme. This work is continuing, and we remain as committed as ever to eradicating unacceptable behaviour from our workplace.“Since 2018 we have implemented a number of improvements including increased resources for mediation, counselling, and our confidential employee assistance line. We also have a wide range of employee-led networks which provide peer support and advocate for change and improvements.”Sellafield declined to comment on McDermott’s case. It has previously said that her claims are “entirely without substance” and noted that an appeal against the findings of her employment tribunal upheld its original ruling.An ONR spokesperson said: “Sellafield is the most intensely regulated nuclear site in Britain and we undertake several hundred inspections and engagements every year.“We have found no evidence that cultural issues have resulted in unsafe activities on the site. However, we are not complacent and will continue to scrutinise Sellafield closely to ensure that safety and security remain their highest priorities and are not compromised by any factors, including internal culture and behaviours.”Claire Coutinho, the secretary of state for energy security and net zero, wrote to the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority which owns Sellafield on Tuesday after the Guardian’s investigation into the site. She requested a “urgent” update on efforts to fix any concerns about its workplace culture.

 I used to fly around the world in all-expenses-paid luxury – but I couldn’t face my conscienceCarlton Reid,Quitting flying as a travel writer was easier than I expected. Now for the hard part: convincing my family to do the same,,"As a travel writer, I’m used to receiving invitations to five-star resorts in far-flung destinations such as the Seychelles, all expenses paid. But now I ignore these emails. I quit flying three years ago. I’m not afraid to fly; I stopped because of the climate crisis. In addition to travel, I write about green issues, and I decided I could no longer in good conscience specialise in sustainability while continuing to fly.I was a late convert to the cause, taking a plane to Israel in 2020 to write about a Palestinian cycle advocacy group. A trip like that would be off limits to me today, even if peace broke out any time soon. It’s all but impossible to reach Israel from Europe without flying. It’s almost as tough to reach the Antipodes from the UK without a long-haul flight, so bang goes a quick-ish trip to New Zealand or Australia.I could still get to North America if I waited for one of the monthly crossings on Cunard’s Queen Mary 2 to New York from Southampton, but I couldn’t get there in a rush: there and back would take two weeks (and tickets for paying travellers start at around £1,000, one way).Quitting flying has undoubtedly shrunk my world. But I still do long-haul trips within Europe, using high-speed trains and slow-speed sleeper services. I also take to the water: I’ve written up train-and-ferry trips to Malta, Sardinia and Ibiza. I also crossed the Dover Strait on a test sail for a proposed wind-powered catamaran ferry from Dover to Boulogne.And, somewhat surprisingly, my work hasn’t suffered. Without flying, I’ve still been able to file copy from the European Commission in Brussels, penned business stories from the Tour de France’s visit to Denmark and swanned around Sweden on a press launch for a new electric car. When I reported on the opening ceremony of the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow in 2021, I cycled there from Newcastle. When I had to go back for the summit’s closing, I took the Caledonian Sleeper train from London.But for all this eco street cred, I can’t help but feel I am a lousy flight-free advocate because I’m yet to convince my family to follow suit. Last year, my wife flew to Madeira without me (there are no ferries to the island), and at the time of writing this piece, our three millennial kids were on separate flight-based holidays in Belgium, Dubai and Greece.When I moan, ever so gently, about their chosen mode of (planet-trashing) travel, they point out I’m a hypocrite because – and it’s true – I have spent a lifetime flying. Piqued by my holier-than-thou snarks, they argue I am in no position to lecture them. That is a fair point, and I put it to Maja Rosén, co-founder of We Stay on the Ground, who has not flown since 2008 and coordinates the worldwide “flight-free” movement.“We need to be cutting emissions now,” she told me, but she couldn’t conjure an argument that worked with my family. “There are so many ways to explore the world without flying,” she tried, which is true, but that cuts no ice with those with itchy feet who can’t afford the sky-high prices of long-distance train travel.Scrawled bits of paper and an A-Z: How I went cold turkey on Google Maps | Ned VesseyRead moreTravelling by train instead of flying is also deemed by many to be “virtue signalling”. There’s even a new Swedish word for this: tagskryt – “train bragging” – to describe how some people, myself included, crow about their long-distance journeys by train when others fly. Because it’s quick, cheap and egalitarian, flying remains the done thing.Might the digital nomad argument – the notion that you can work on trains – cut through? Probably not, and it’s oversold anyway. For all my ambitious plans to bang out article after article when travelling by rail, I tend to doom-scroll in much the same way I’d do up in the clouds. And the views from a train might be captivating in daylight, but rolling through Schleswig-Holstein at night is just as dull as traversing it from 30,000ft above.I’m left with the best reason for not flying: it’s simply better for the planet. Yet, for all the evidence that flying is bad for our long-term survival as a species, those who seek to restrict jet-setting are seen as party poopers. So be it. I remain happy that I kicked the habit, but I can’t deny I miss the idea of travelling to far-flung destinations only accessible by plane. My solution: I’ve trained my inbox to junk the invitations.

" Seven in 10 Australians want government to take more action on climate, survey finds",The Lowy Institute’s annual survey of sentiment on climate action found strong support for net zero emissions by 2050 and a ban on new coalmines,"['Daniel Hurst', '@danielhurstbne']","The Morrison government is under increasing pressure to act on the climate crisis, with a new poll showing seven in 10 Australians want the Coalition to lock in stronger commitments in the lead-up to this year’s Glasgow summit.The Lowy Institute’s annual survey of sentiment on climate action finds strong domestic support for Australia committing to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and majority support for a ban on new coalmines.The findings appear to undercut resistance from some prominent members of the Nationals, who have publicly cautioned the government against making a net zero commitment and have been pushing for a continued embrace of coal.Biden administration says Australia needs to cut greenhouse gas emissions soonerRead moreThe Lowy Institute-commissioned poll of 3,286 Australians found overall concern about climate change had increased over the past year, with 60% of respondents describing global warming as “a serious and pressing problem” and agreeing “we should begin taking steps now even if this involves significant costs”.That represented a four-point increase from 2020.In the latest climate poll, a majority (55%) also said the government’s main priority for energy policy should be “reducing carbon emissions” – an eight percentage point increase since 2019.That compares with 32% of the sample who said the priority should be reducing household bills – a decline of six points over the same period.Reducing the risk of power blackouts – a key focus of the government’s messaging on the issue – was nominated by just 12% of respondents as the energy policy priority in the most recent poll, down three points.With the government facing international pressure to endorse deeper emission cuts in the lead-up to the expanded G7 summit in June and the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in November, the poll finds strong domestic support for doing so.When presented with a question about the forthcoming UN climate negotiations, 70% agreed that “Australia should join other countries, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, to increase its commitments to address climate change”.That compared with about three in 10 respondents (29%) who chose the alternative statement that “Australia should continue with its current policies to address climate change”, while 1% said they did not know.Some 78% of those surveyed said they would support a net zero emissions target by 2050 – an idea Scott Morrison has expressed as a “preference” rather than a formal commitment – while 20% said they would oppose it.Just over six in 10 Australians said they would support a ban on new coalmines opening in Australia, while the same proportion said they would support reducing Australian coal exports to other countries. Just 30% of the sample would support providing subsidies for building new coal-fired power plants.The director of the Lowy Institute’s public opinion and foreign policy program, Natasha Kassam, said the politics and economics of climate action were shifting and a number of elected officials “would take heart” from the results.Kassam said the level of support for moving away from coal would not have been seen several years ago. She noted that 70% of Australia’s coal and gas exports went to countries in Asia that had set net zero commitments.“We’ve seen Australians’ concern about the climate increase since 2012,” she said, while noting there had been a slight dip in the poll last year when “understandably much of the public was feeling pretty anxious about the pandemic”.“What has really shifted in the last couple of years is the willingness of the public to bear costs for climate action … and now we can see the vast majority accept benefits outweigh the costs.”When asked to weigh the consequences of acting on climate change, nearly three-quarters of the respondents (74%) said the benefits of taking further action would outweigh the costs, while about a quarter (24%) said the costs would outweigh the benefits.‘No action on anything’: Australia increasingly isolated as US and others ramp up climate ambitionRead moreOther popular potential policies include providing subsidies for the development of renewable energy technologies (91% support) and providing subsidies for the purchase of electric vehicles (77%).With the government pursuing its so-called “gas-fired recovery” from the pandemic, and planning to spend up to $600m on a new gas-fired power plant in New South Wales, 58% of the sample said they would support increasing the use of gas for Australia’s energy generation.And seven years after the Abbott government repealed the Gillard government’s carbon price after a relentless political campaign, some 64% of the sample said they would support an emissions trading scheme or a carbon tax.The Lowy Institute said its climate poll was based on a nationally representative online and telephone survey conducted by the Social Research Centre between 12 and 26 April, with a margin of error of about 1.8%.The Sydney-based thinktank has been tracking attitudes to global warming since 2006, when 68% of respondents agreed that it was “a serious and pressing problem” requiring Australia to take steps even if it involved costs.That dropped to a low of 36% in 2012 at the height of the acrimonious political battle over the Gillard government’s carbon pricing scheme, before steadily rising in subsequent years.",2021-06-05
 This article is more than 4 months oldWednesday briefing: Fukushima nuclear plant is set to flush tonnes of water into the sea – but is it safe?This article is more than 4 months old,"In today’s newsletter: Japan’s decision to release radioactive water from the tsunami-hit power plant has divided groups – is it entirely safe or staggeringly stupid?
 Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition",['Helen Pidd'],"Good morning.Today’s newsletter comes to you from Manchester, original home of the Guardian (est 1821), and me, Helen Pidd, your friendly north of England editor. I’ll be writing the daily briefing alongside Nimo for the next few weeks.Our latest edition concerns events in Japan 12 years ago, when a huge earthquake struck off the country’s north-east coast, triggering a tsunami that caused the worst nuclear disaster since Chornobyl.More than a decade later, the clean-up continues at Fukushima. This week the Japanese government announced that work will begin on Thursday to pump more than one million tonnes of water into the sea from the destroyed Daiichi nuclear power plant, in a move that has prompted horror from environmental groups and consternation in neighbouring countries.Is it madness to pollute the Pacific Ocean with enough tainted water to fill at least 500 Olympic-sized swimming pools?I spoke to the Guardian’s Japan correspondent, Justin McCurry, as he packed his bags to return to Fukushima, saying that he had no qualms about drinking the local sake and how the area has become a surfing hotspot once more.In depth: ‘Plants pump diluted tritium into the sea all the time and nobody bats an eyelid’An activist holds a placard at a protest in Seoul against the planned release of wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant into the Pacific Ocean. 22 August 2023. Photograph: Anthony Wallace/AFP/Getty ImagesOn 11 March 2011 a magnitude 9.0 earthquake triggered a tsunami that knocked out the backup electricity supply at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant on Japan’s north-eastern Pacific coast, leading to meltdowns in three of its reactors.Ever since, 1.34m tonnes of radioactive water has accumulated at the site, according to the plant operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco). This includes liquid used for cooling, plus rain and groundwater that has seeped in.Earlier this year, Justin visited the site, and saw the thousand or so steel tanks being used to house the contaminated water (pictured above). “They’re three storeys high and are all together across a wide area,” he said.Tepco says it will soon run out of storage room and this week was granted permission to start releasing “treated” water from the tanks into the Pacific Ocean.The plan has caused controversy because the water contains tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen that can’t be removed by the facility’s water filtration technology.It will not be pumped out all at once, but over the next 30 to 40 years. The first discharge, starting on Thursday (weather permitting) will total 7,800 cubic metres over about 17 days, Tepco said. For those of you not great at visualising volumes, that’s about three Olympic swimming pools.Is it dangerous?The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has approved the discharge, saying that the radiological impact on people and the environment would be “negligible”.The levels of tritium will be 1/40th of the legal level for discharges, Tepco insists, and has promised to upload hourly data on water quality. The scientific consensus has persuaded Justin that “as long as you are exposed to tritium in low doses, it doesn’t represent a threat to human health”.Greenpeace, however, has described the filtration process as flawed, and warned that an “immense” quantity of radioactive material will be dispersed into the sea over the coming decades. Concerns have also been raised by the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), the main intergovernmental organisation representing the region, which has been consulting with Japan over the release for the past two years and in January said it had “grave concerns” over the plans. In June, the PIF issued a statement drawing attention to international laws against dumping nuclear waste in the Pacific.Justin has come to the view that storing the water indefinitely is not a realistic option: “When does it end? What are you going to do with 2m tonnes, 3m tonnes? What about a leak? That area gets tsunamis, it gets quakes, it gets typhoons. What if something like that were to happen and lots of the tanks were damaged?”But much remains unknown. Justin asked a “very sensible” anti-nuclear expert if it would be safe for him to go swimming in the sea in Fukushima in September. The expert said yes, but that the problem is not swimming but “organically bound tritium – over the years, when it gets into seaweed, shellfish or fish and then consumed by humans over a long period. What does that do to human health? It’s difficult to say.”The falloutSurf’s up on Iwasawa beach in Naraha, Fukushima prefecture, Japan. Photograph: Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty ImagesSome of Japan’s neighbours are very unhappy. Hong Kong – the second-largest importer of food products from Japan after mainland China – said it will ban “aquatic products” from 10 Japanese prefectures. That includes the capital Tokyo, as well as Fukushima itself.Last month, Chinese customs administration threatened a blanket ban on all foodstuffs from the same 10 areas.Though South Korea’s government has given Japan its blessing, many residents are panicking, with reports that some people are stockpiling sea salt.Justin says there is an element of hypocrisy there. “Nuclear power plants, including those in South Korea, and China, pump diluted tritium into the sea all the time and nobody bats an eyelid.”China, he said, saw the controversy as a “very useful stick with which to beat Japan at the moment”.Japanese fishers are understandably worried about the damage to their reputation. So too are the marine-related tourist businesses which have started to reopen in Fukushima.Next month Justin is due in Fukushima again to cover an international surfing festival. Having visited the area on numerous occasions since 2011, including at least six visits to the wrecked power plant itself, he has no worries about his health on his latest trip.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

","['Donna Lu', '@donnadlu']","Authorities are continuing the search for a tiny radioactive capsule lost along a 1,400km stretch of Western Australian desert highway.The 8mm by 6mm capsule fell from a secure device on a truck that was travelling from a Rio Tinto mine site, north of Newman in the Pilbara region, to Perth, where it was being sent for repair.According to WA authorities, the capsule was packaged on 10 January, transported offsite on 12 January, and the casing it was contained within arrived in Perth on 16 January. It wasn’t until nine days later, on 25 January, that it was discovered missing when the package was unpacked for inspection.Search stepped up for potentially deadly radioactive capsule lost in Western AustraliaRead moreWA’s Department of Fire and Emergency Services on Monday said radiation specialists were searching along the Great Northern Highway by “driving north and south directions at slow speeds”. The department said earlier it was using radiation detection equipment that could be fitted to vehicles in the search.What is the capsule used for?The missing capsule is a 19-GBq (gigabecquerel, a unit of radioactive decay) caesium-137 ceramic source, commonly used in radiation gauges. Caesium-137 is a radioactive metal with a half-life of 30.05 years – meaning in three decades it will have half of its original activity. It emits beta and gamma radiation.In the missing capsule, the caesium is bound in a “ceramic matrix” rather than existing in a loose powder form. The caesium-137 is encapsulated by steel, which prevents beta particles from penetrating through.

The general manager of Radiation Services WA, Lauren Steen, said capsules like these are commonly used industrially as fixed radiation gauges, which measure the density and flow of materials. They are widely used in the mining, and oil and gas industries.“What they look at is the rate of flow or level in a pipe,” Steen said. The gamma rays emitted by the caesium-137 penetrate through the pipe and are picked up on the other side by a detector.Steen said a radioactive source like the missing capsule was typically designed to be left in place for a lifespan of about 15 years, with yearly regulatory checks.The small, round and silver capsule containing radioactive caesium-137 went missing in transportation through Western AustraliaThe source would continue to be radioactive and detectable above natural background radiation levels in the environment for about 300 years, according to Dale Bailey, a professor of medical imaging science at the University of Sydney.In the medical setting, caesium-137 has historically been used in radiotherapy. “One of the biggest sources in a hospital is the blood irradiator – you sterilise blood with the gamma photons from cobalt-60 or caesium before you do a transfusion,” Bailey said.How dangerous is the capsule?Bailey said the missing capsule posed two main hazards to humans: exposure, and the more serious concern, contamination, which occurs when radioactive material comes into contact with something, such as the human body or soil or a road.Tech coalition aiming to create Australian high-powered laser industry with nuclear fusion ambitionsRead more“Exposure is like sitting in the sun on a hot day and getting UV radiation,” he said. “If you limit your time and you maximise your distance from it, then you limit how much exposure you get.”Authorities have said spending an hour at one metre’s distance from the missing capsule was similar to receiving 10 X-rays, but Radiation Services WA estimates the radiation dose is about 17 chest X-rays.It estimates the capsule’s radiation dose is about 1.665 millisieverts an hour. The normal amount of background radiation a person in Australia is exposed to in a year is about 1.5 millisieverts.The capsule’s steel container prevents radioactive material escaping, but if it were to be broken, contamination would be a greater worry.The beta particles – no longer contained by a barrier – could cause serious damage, resulting in reddening of the skin, or ulceration or tissue death in severe cases, Bailey said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ingestion would be very dangerous. Caesium “would go to the bone, because that’s just what caesium does … then you’re going to have continuous radiation by the beta particles and the gamma rays. They’re not going to be eliminated.”“If you swallow this source, you’re likely to get local ulceration in the gut and that can lead to a rupture.”How many similar capsules exist?According to Radiation Services WA, there are thousands of radioactive sources around the state that are used and transported daily without issue.“The Radiological Council of WA or any radiation health unit in any state or territory in Australia, or around the world, knows each and every single source – they have a database,” Steen said. “They would have to go through a federal import process as well.”Transport of sources between locations often requires prior submission of regulatory documents.Most of Australia’s nuclear waste comes from Lucas Heights – should it stay there?Read more“Checks and balances are in place, but it’s probably a bit of a wake up call to all the companies about the serious nature of radioactivity,” Steen said.Caesium-137 capsules are commonly imported, although Bailey said local manufacture would be possible at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation’s (Ansto) nuclear reactor. “It’s a byproduct of the uranium fission reaction,” he said.Steen said: “I’m not aware of anybody who manufactures them in Australia.”The WA Radiological Council was contacted for comment.What happens to nuclear waste?Once they are no longer useful, capsules like the missing source are typically exported if they have been manufactured elsewhere. “Generally speaking, you’re unable to dispose of anything not generated in WA within WA,” Steen said. “Anything that comes from overseas generally goes straight back.”Bailey agreed: “Traditionally in Australia, we’ve sent it back to its source, maybe the US or Canada or Europe.”Most of the nuclear waste Australia does have is stored at Ansto’s facilities at Lucas Heights.In 2020 the Morrison government selected a site near Kimba, South Australia, for a national nuclear waste facility but the decision has faced a legal challenge from Barngarla traditional owners.",2023-01-31
 This article is more than 3 months oldNumber of nesting seabirds on Lundy island at nine-decade highThis article is more than 3 months old,"Tiny island in Bristol Channel has 25,000 Manx shearwaters – 95% of England’s breeding population – and 1,335 puffins ","['Patrick Barkham', '@patrick_barkham']","There are more seabirds nesting on the island of Lundy than at any time since the 1930s, conservationists have revealed.The tiny island in the Bristol Channel, a globally famed location for Britain’s seabirds, is now home to 25,000 Manx shearwaters – 95% of England’s breeding population – as well as 1,335 puffins and more than 150 pairs of storm petrels, a species that only arrived on the island in 2014.Despite the recent threat of avian flu, which has decimated wild bird populations in some of the world’s most sensitive locations, and the problematic decline in wild sources of food such as sand eels, the total number of seabirds on Lundy stood at 40,000 this summer.This is a massive turnaround after just 7,351 remained in 2000. Puffins were close to extinction, with just 13 counted on the windswept 450-hectare island in 2001.Seabirds treble on Lundy after island is declared rat-freeRead moreBut a drive to remove rats from the island has helped numbers to rebound. Black and brown rats, which arrived on Lundy as stowaways on ships over many decades, had been preying on the eggs and chicks, particularly those of burrow-nesting shearwaters and puffins.The rats were eradicated in a partnership led by the RSPB, Natural England, the Landmark Trust and the National Trust between 2002 and 2004 – a move that was opposed at the time by some animal rights groups, who argued that conservationists were favouring tourist-friendly birds over the rats.Since the island was declared rat-free in 2006, its seabird populations have bounced back, as they have on other small islands when invasive predators let loose by humans have been removed.Paul St Pierre, a conservation officer for the RSPB, said: “Partnership projects like this show just how much potential there is to restore species and landscapes on an incredible scale.“If we can restore over 30,000 birds to one small island in the Bristol Channel, just imagine how much could be achieved if everyone came together to restore nature right across the UK.”Manx shearwaters taking off near Lundy. Photograph: National Trust Images/Nick Upton/PAOngoing biosecurity work has ensured no rats have returned to Lundy on boats, while annual surveying has revealed the dramatic population recovery.Global populations of seabirds have fallen by 70% since the 1950s, and in northern Britain most seabird populations have experienced significant declines in recent years. But more southerly summer populations of seabirds that feed in the waters off south Wales and south-west England have largely bucked this downward trend.Derek Green, the general manager of Lundy, said: “We’re delighted by the dramatic increase of seabirds on Lundy in recent years. Conservation is at the heart of everything we do on the island and we look forward to continuing to nurture this very special place for future generations to enjoy.”British coasts are internationally important for many species including puffins, grey seals and Manx shearwaters, with more than 80% of the world’s population nesting in the country.The revival recalls the abundance of the 1930s: in 1939 it was estimated that Lundy was home to 80,000 seabirds.",2023-10-11
" This article is more than 10 months oldMeat, dairy and rice production will bust 1.5C climate target, shows studyThis article is more than 10 months old","Emissions from food system alone will drive the world past target, unless high-methane foods are tackled","['Damian Carrington', ' Environment editor', '@dpcarrington']","Emissions from the food system alone will drive the world past 1.5C of global heating, unless high-methane foods are tackled.Climate-heating emissions from food production, dominated by meat, dairy and rice, will by themselves break the key international target of 1.5C if left unchecked, a detailed study has shown.The analysis estimated that if today’s level of food emissions continued, they would result in at least 0.7C of global heating by the end of the century, on top of the 1C rise already seen. This means emissions from food alone, ignoring the huge impact of fossil fuels, would push the world past the 1.5C limit.Methane emissions from 15 meat and dairy companies rival those of the EURead moreThe study showed that 75% of this food-related heating was driven by foods that are high sources of methane, ie those coming from ruminant livestock such as cattle, and rice paddy fields. However, the scientists said the temperature rise could be cut by 55% by cutting meat consumption in rich countries to medically recommended levels, reducing emissions from livestock and their manure, and using renewable energy in the food system.Previous studies have shown the huge impact of food production on the environment, particularly meat and dairy, but the new study provides estimates of the temperature rises their emissions could cause. These could be a significant underestimate, however, as the study assumed animal product consumption would remain level in the future but it was projected to rise by 70% by 2050.“Methane has this really dominant role in driving the warming associated with the food systems,” said Catherine Ivanovich, at Columbia University in the US, who led the research. “Sustaining the pattern [of food production] we have today is not consistent with keeping the 1.5C temperature threshold. That places a lot of urgency on reducing the emissions, especially from the high-methane food groups.”“We have to make the goal of sustaining our global population consistent with a climate-safe future,” she said.The contribution of global food production to the climate crisis is complex because it involves several important greenhouse gases, all of which have different abilities to trap heat and persist in the atmosphere for different amounts of time. Previous studies have converted the impact of methane and other gases into an equivalent amount of CO2 over 100 years, but this underplayed the high potency of methane over shorter timescales.The research, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, treated each greenhouse gas separately for 94 key types of food, enabling their impact on climate over time to be better understood. Feeding this emissions data into a widely used climate model showed that the continuation of today’s food production would lead to a rise of 0.7C by 2100 if global population growth was low, and a 0.9C rise if population growth was high.“As we had already reached more than 1C warming above pre-industrial levels by 2021, this additional warming [from food production] alone is enough to surpass the 1.5C global warming target,” the scientists concluded. “Our analysis clearly demonstrates that current dietary production and consumption patterns are incompatible with sustaining a growing population while pursuing a secure climate future.”Food-related temperature rise could be curbed, the researchers said. If people adopted the healthy diet recommended by Harvard medical school, which allows a single serving of red meat a week, the rise could be cut by 0.2C. Such a diet would mean a big cut in meat eating in rich nations but could mean an increase in some poorer countries.Cutting methane emissions from cattle using feed additives and better management of manure could avoid another 0.2C, the researchers said, while switching to green energy in the food system would cut 0.15C. Ivanovich said the emissions reductions options included in the study were those possible today but that future technological advances might be able to reduce emissions further.“We already know that livestock production has a disproportionate contribution to climate change – even using traditional metrics, in 2021 we showed that 57% of emissions from the food system arise from animal agriculture,” said Prof Pete Smith, at the University of Aberdeen, UK. “This very neat study uses a simple climate model to show the disproportionate impact of methane emissions from agriculture on temperature increases, and throws light on the importance of reducing methane emissions from the food system.”Only a third of the world’s countries have included policies to cut emissions from agriculture in the climate plans they have submitted under the UN Paris agreement. The researchers said their work was aimed at increasing the understanding of the impact of global food consumption on future global heating. Ivanovich also said policies to cut emissions had to protect access to food and livelihoods for vulnerable populations.",2023-03-07
 This article is more than 4 months oldEurope hits roadblocks in the race to switch to electric carsThis article is more than 4 months old,"Despite progress towards a 2045 zero-emission goal, the high price of EVs has created a headache for governments",['Ajit Niranjan'],"European countries are struggling to persuade people to switch from combustion engine cars to electric ones, experts warn.Europe sells 10 times more electric cars today than it did just six years ago, according to the International Energy Agency, but its fleet is cleaning up too slowly to meet its climate goals. Governments across the continent are struggling with the price-tag of electric vehicles, which can cost several thousand euros more upfront than comparable ones that burn fossil fuels.“What we have learned is that it’s not enough just to incentivise electric vehicle purchase and ownership,” said Julia Poliscanova, an analyst at campaign group Transport and Environment. “You also have to disincentivise the purchase of conventional cars at the same time.”The EU’s move to cleaner cars is part of its promise to cut planet-heating pollution 65% from 1990 levels by the end of the decade, and hit net zero by 2045. But even as it has slashed emissions in its power sector, putting up wind turbines and shutting down coal plants, emissions from road transport have risen steadily in the background.Transport was the “problem child” of climate protection, said Christian Hochfeld, head of Agora Verkehrswende, a clean transport thinktank in Germany. Because most alternatives to cars took time and money to build, the full switch to electric vehicles was “the most critical issue” for reducing emissions in the next decade, he said.The EU plans to bring car emissions down by 55% from 2021 levels by the end of the decade, and to zero by 2035. But customers are put off by the high upfront price of electric cars, even if they pay off in the future through lower running costs.To help counter this, countries across Europe offer customers financial incentives to buy cleaner cars. According to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA), 21 of the 27 EU member states offer tax breaks when buying a low-carbon car, while 20 offer money to help with the purchase.Soaring energy costs could threaten future of electric cars, experts warnRead moreRomania offers as much as €11,500 to people buying an electric vehicle. Belgium has incentives for company cars, which form the bulk of its new car sales and serve as a pipeline to the secondhand market that more people can afford. Italy and Spain contribute to the cost of infrastructure to charge electric vehicles. France offers a €5,000 purchase bonus and exempts electric vehicles from penalties based on weight.“It’s not perfect, but what the French are doing is really going in the right direction,” said Poliscanova.In a bid to persuade poorer households to use electric cars, France has announced plans for a social leasing scheme that would let “those who need it most” rent an electric car for €100 a month. The government is particularly wary of green policies that raise costs for poorer households after an attempt to raise fuel taxes in 2018 sparked widespread riots and gave rise to the “yellow vest” protest movement.French president Emmanuel Macron, who trumpeted the scheme before elections last year, is yet to set out a concrete plan of how it will work. But the political signal had already encouraged some French carmakers to move towards small and cheap electric cars, instead of heavy and expensive ones, said Poliscanova.In Germany, meanwhile, the government has cut subsidies for electric vehicles as the number of people buying them has soared.“It’s not sustainable to put out subsidies as high as we did in the past,” said Hochfeld, “and it’s also not socially fair because everyone in Germany – every taxpayer – pays for this transition, even if they don’t have a car.”Germany is Europe’s biggest polluter and car market. While it taxes car ownership and provides an exemption for electric vehicles, it does not tax car acquisition, the point at which consumers decide whether to buy the vehicle.It would be fairer to tax vehicles at the point of purchase and subsidise electric vehicles through that, said Hochfeld.“Why should a nurse pay for the electric vehicle of a dentist … who’s able to buy a big SUV with subsidies? That’s not fair. But if the lawyer buying a combustion engine car would pay for the dentist who buys an electric vehicle? I would say that’s OK.”Marc Lüers, managing director of online marketplace Carwow, said that the German car market had “flipped” since the war in Ukraine, with demand for electric cars in particular suffering from rising inflation and falling subsidies.I travelled the UK and Ireland in an electric car, and what a shocker: nothing went wrong | Charlotte NaughtonRead moreApart from the price of the vehicle, he added, “the two largest concerns of electric vehicle-buyers in Germany are charging infrastructure and the price of electricity”.Just seven EU countries offer incentives for charging infrastructure, according to the ACEA.To boost uptake of electric cars, the quantity of different policies mattered as well as the quality, said Gracia Brückmann, an energy researcher at the University of Berne.In Norway, for instance, where 9 in 10 new cars sold are electric or hybrids, the government provided a range of incentives for electric vehicles as early as the 1990s, which it later phased out. As well as tax breaks, the government offered free parking, access to ferries and the right to drive in bus lanes.This helped governments find the right fit for each person, said Brückmann. “The more policies you have in place, the lower your car fleet’s total emissions gets over time.”",2023-08-27
‘Metal box heated from the inside’: food truck workers’ battle against heat,Hotter summers are making it increasingly difficult to keep cool in what are ‘basically like little ovens’ as staff battle discomfort,"['Supported by', 'About this content', 'Cecilia Nowell', ' in Albuquerque, New Mexico']","As tortillas warm on the grill at Los Pookies – an Albuquerque, New Mexico-based food truck best known for its birria tacos – a swamp cooler blasts cool air and extractor fans try their best to suck the heat out of the metal trailer.‘Fruit of kings’: heatwave is a blessing for Arizona’s desert-loving date palmsRead moreBut when temperatures in New Mexico hit the 100s in early July, owner Luis Dominguez says, the fans didn’t feel like enough: so he completely removed the food truck’s front window. Unlike air conditioning, swamp coolers, which use fans and water to create chilly air, actually perform better with increased circulation. Dominguez hoped taking out the window and opening the trailer’s back door would let in more fresh air and improve ventilation for his staff.“We’ve done everything we can,” said Dominguez. When his employees have a moment between customers, they step out of the food truck and gulp down bottles of water and Pedialyte. But, “it is very hot in the food truck. We have the grill going, the fryers going and it is metal walls all the way around. So it’s basically like a little oven.”In the three-and-a-half years that Los Pookies has been open, Dominguez says, all of the summers have been hot. But he can’t remember one this bad.As this July came to an end, the World Meteorological Association declared it the hottest month ever recorded on Earth. In the American south-west, the city of Phoenix, Arizona, recorded a 31-day stretch of temperatures over 110F and temperatures in Death Valley peaked at 128F, just shy of the national park’s 1913 record. In New Mexico, the extreme heat was compounded by the delayed arrival of the state’s typical summer monsoon season – without the afternoon rains, there was nothing to cut the midday heat.A Democrat’s obsessive quest to change the way America is farmed and fedRead moreFor food truck owners in the desert south-west, beating the record temperatures has required creativity and persistence. Like other industries facing a reckoning over the heat, New Mexico’s food truck fans and customers are wondering what the future holds. But staff and employees are more resolute – despite the discomfort, they’re convinced the industry will persevere.“Food trucks are going to be food trucks,” said Jae Stulock, owner of the Asian fusion food truck Umami Moto.That doesn’t mean it’s easy: outside, “it might be 105 degrees”, he said, but “inside, the truck is about 115 to, I think we’ve recorded 122 degrees”.Those temperatures are extreme for one hour and even worse on busy days when the truck is parked at breweries for 10 hours. But that’s just the nature of the industry.“Food trucks are essentially a metal box,” said Basit Gauba, owner of two New Mexico-based food trucks: Tikka Spice, which specializes in South Asian street food, and Stackers, which is known for its green chile cheeseburgers. “A metal box that’s heated from the inside on a summer day. So it gets pretty hot.”Food trucks are essentially a metal box ... that’s heated from the inside on a summer day. So it gets pretty hotBasit GaubaTikka Spice is lucky to have air-conditioning, says Gauba, but with the exhaust vents running and the window open to take customers’ orders, it doesn’t always help. Plus, operating the air-conditioning requires a certain amount of power that not all pop-up sites can offer. If the truck is parked at a brewery they might be able to turn it on, but few parks have adequate hook-ups. Instead, his staff has taken to wearing cooling towels around their necks and turning off any equipment that they can when they’re not cooking.“The only thing we can’t turn off is our fryers,” said Gauba. “But as far as grills and charbroilers and stoves, if we’re not using it, we’ll have it off. That helps out a lot.”When everything’s up and running, though, the heat can impact the function of that equipment. “If the sun is shining on the passenger side of the truck, that’s where our refrigeration is, so the refrigeration is fighting that heat. And that pulls more power from the generator. And the generator can only handle so much,” said Stulock. When it shuts off, there’s no way to keep anything cold anymore.The breweries that Tikka Spice and other food trucks park outside of some days have taken to giving the staff pails of ice chips, which they ladle into a mobile swamp cooler to lower the temperature inside the truck even more than the A/C can. “It melts pretty quick,” says Gauba, “but then it gives you a cooler, fresher air.”Those partnerships with breweries – and other pop-up sites – are essential, Dominguez said. Brewery employees made sure his staff were well-supplied with cold water when temperatures were at their highest and invited them into the air-conditioned spaces during their breaks. If temperatures get hotter in the coming years, Stulock says he’s considering asking his brewery partners to build shade covers for the trucks.Those partners also keep customers coming out despite the heat: after they stand in line for their food, customers can retreat inside for a cold drink. But even then, Stulock says, the heat makes business hard: “Attendance goes down dramatically. People just don’t come out.” When they do, it’s usually at night, when the food truck has been outside for hours and staff are getting tired.We have the grill going, the fryers going and it is metal walls all the way around. So it’s basically like a little ovenLuis DominguezGauba and his wife have recently opened two brick-and-mortar restaurants and they know staff prefer shifts at the air-conditioned spaces. So they’ve started offering higher rates to employees who work the food truck – that way they get paid more for what can be a more uncomfortable shift in the peak summer heat.This summer, Gauba found himself looking to other parts of the world for inspiration. As immigrants from Pakistan, Gauba and his wife found themselves reflecting on the night markets popular across much of the Middle East and Asia where, he said, people do everything they can to avoid being outside in the middle of the day.Even in the US, Gauba noticed other food trucks in cities like Phoenix and San Antonio, Texas, shifting their hours later and later in the day. “I think that’s going to be the future if it keeps going this way,” Gauba said. “If it does get hotter, we’ll have to really change how we operate.”Although it’s been a more difficult summer, Dominguez doesn’t think the changing climate means the end of the industry. For many small business owners, especially immigrant and working class families, food trucks are a path toward opening their own restaurants and other ventures.People who work in food trucks “have a really, really strong work ethic”, says Dominguez. “We don’t care if it’s 200 degrees outside or negative 30, we’ll be out selling, we have to, just because that’s how we make ends meet.”",2023-12-07

","['Adam Morton', ' and ', 'Rafqa Touma']","Labor is being urged to axe nearly $2bn in handouts to fossil fuel developments that the Parliamentary Budget Office found were promised under the Coalition but have not been contracted.The PBO analysis, commissioned by the Greens, found the Morrison government announced $1.93bn in support for coal and gas developments that had not been formally committed.The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, called on the government to cancel what he called “zombie fossil fuel subsidies” and reallocate the funding to renewable investments in next month’s budget.“Public money should not fund coal and gas,” he said. “If money is as tight as the treasurer says it is, then Morrison-era handouts to coal and gas should be the first to get the chop.” Australia is pushing to host a Cop meeting – if successful it would be forced to ramp up climate action | Adam MortonRead moreMost of the pledges were part of what the Morrison government said would be a “gas-fired recovery” from the pandemic. Many were for developments in the Northern Territory.They included $300m for liquified natural gas exports; $200m for an industrial development at Darwin’s Middle Arm that would involve petrochemical and hydrogen production, minerals processing and carbon capture and storage (CCS); $172.6m for “gas industry roads upgrades”; and $23.1m for drilling grants to access gas in the Beetaloo Basin.Nationally, there was $270.2m for “clean” hydrogen development, which includes hydrogen made with gas, $262.1m for carbon capture projects and $547.2m for the commercialisation of “low emissions international technology partnerships”.There was also $59.5m for the Cooper and Adavale gas basins in outback Queensland and South Australia, and $50.4m for future gas infrastructure investment.Contracts had been signed for $793m, including $600m for a gas power plant to be operated by Snowy Hydro at Kurri Kurri.Shani Tager, a senior campaigner with 350.org who led an earlier review of outstanding Coalition fossil fuel subsidies, said the analysis had vindicated her organisation’s work.“It shows [the Coalition] were big on announcements, but not big on follow through, which is good news really,” she said. “It means there is an opportunity for these projects to be stopped.”Asked at a press conference on Tuesday whether the spending announcements could be cut, the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, said: “You’ll have to wait and see”.A government spokesperson said: “We’re going through the budget line by line to ensure that investments deliver value for taxpayers.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The resources minister, Madeleine King, has previously supported Labor maintaining funding for the Middle Arm precinct, but told the NT News it was being audited as part of the budget process. She has also supported opening up new gas fields “subject to independent scientific assessments and effective environmental regulation”.‘It doesn’t make sense’: Pacific leaders say Australia’s support for new coal at odds with Cop29 bidRead moreThe opposition said it expected Labor to keep the Coalition funding announcements, which it called “critical nation building commitments”. Its climate change and energy spokesperson, Ted O’Brien, said many of the projects had been “designed to support the commercialisation of low-emissions technologies, boost energy supply, fortify our energy security and put downward pressure on power prices”.“The Greens have no regard for regional Australia nor the traditional industries that many Australians rely on and have long been central to Australia’s competitive advantage,” O’Brien said.Gas is a fossil fuel that has often been described as having about the emissions of coal when burned for energy, but studies have found this underestimates its impact on the climate.The head of the International Energy Agency last year backed scientific warnings that no new gas fields could be developed if the world was to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has made the same argument. In June, he said fossil fuel companies and the banks that finance them “have humanity by the throat”.",2022-09-20
 This article is more than 2 months oldRescuers free humpback whale ‘hog-tied’ to 300lb crab pot in AlaskaThis article is more than 2 months old,"Local residents discovered trapped whale ‘trailing two buoys, making unusual sounds and having trouble moving freely’",['Maya Yang'],"A young humpback whale was freed by rescuers in Alaska after it was discovered hog-tied to a 300lb crab pot.The rescue, which occurred on 11 October, came after two local residents discovered the trapped whale a day earlier in the coastal waters near Gustavus, a city close to Glacier Bay national park in the southernmost part of Alaska. Researchers estimate the whale to be about three to four years old.The residents contacted the visitor information center at Glacier Bay national park and reported that a whale near the Gustavus dock was “trailing two buoys, making unusual sounds and having trouble moving freely”, the National Park Service said.In a press release issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Janet Neilson, an NPS whale biologist who was part of the rescue, said that park personnel located the whale from shore and confirmed that it was dragging two buoys.“They were able to get out on the water right away to confirm the entanglement and take photos of the animal and gear that helped paint a much more thorough picture,” she said.Rescue team members including NPS patrol teams and experts involved with the Large Whale Entanglement Response network were soon able to determine that the whale’s entanglement was “life threatening”, Noaa said in the release.The crew observed that the whale was swimming in a tight clockwise circle that “appeared to be intermittently anchored to the seafloor” by a 300lb crab pot with 450ft of heavy duty line, according to NPS.It added, the rescue team members were able to get in touch with the owner of the gear who said they had set the pot near Pleasant Island, which lies south-east of Gustavus. However, between Saturday and Sunday morning, the pot had gone missing, meaning that the whale had already been entangled for at least three days when residents reported the discovery, NPS said.Rescue team members were deployed on site the next day and used drone footage to collect aerial photographs and videos of the whale’s entanglement.00:00:40Drone footage shows humpback whale entangled in heavy crab line off Alaska – video“This was a complicated entanglement with a line through the whale’s mouth, and wrapped around the animal’s tail stock,” Fred Sharpe, advanced large whale entanglement responder with Alaska Whale Foundation, told the Noaa. “The drone imagery assisted tremendously with our understanding of the entanglement and how to prioritize our cutting attempts,” he added.The NPS said the whale was making 7-9-minute dives and was at the surface for only approximately 30 seconds.“The whale had a loop of line through its mouth that led to a large, heavy glob of tangled lines at its tail. In effect, the whale was hog-tied, its body bent sharply to the side as it swam in a predictable clockwise circle each time it came up. The whale also had a distinct healed scar across its back from being hit by a vessel’s propeller,” it said.The crew was eventually able to make cuts into the line using specialized tools designed to keep responders at a safe distance from the whale. One of the tools includes a knife on the end of a 25ft carbon fiber pole and grappling hooks modified with razor-sharp knife blades inside the grapple to cut as they grab, the Noaa said.“The turning point came when we were able to cut the rope that ran through the whale’s mouth and was wrapped around its tail,” said Chris Gabriele, a whale biologist with Glacier Bay national park who was part of the rescue efforts.Crews spent hours cutting away at the rope to free the whale.Officials with the whale entanglement response team plan to look for the whale in the coming weeks to document its condition if it is still in the area.",2023-10-31
Weatherwatch: odds shortening on repeat of disastrous 1953 North Sea flood,"As sea level rises, chance grows of there being another similar disaster caused by low pressure and a spring tide",['Paul Brown'],"One of my earliest memories is of my father tuning in the radio and his face turning ashen white. His shock was caused by hearing the news of the 1953 flood that had inundated the east coast, including parts of Norfolk where he was born and many of our family still lived.The flood had affected many communities along the North Sea coast, claiming more than 300 lives in the UK and more than 1,800 in the Netherlands, with vast areas of farmland flooded in both countries. The devastation was the result of a deep depression, with high winds from the north funnelling a wall of water down the North Sea, coinciding with a high tide. As the sea narrowed the towering waves overtopped long-neglected flood defences.It took days to discover family members were safe, months to repair damage to homes and farms, and years for the lessons learned to be implemented. These included early warning systems for flooding, restored sea defences and eventually, in 1982, the Thames Barrier to protect London. These measures were all designed to prevent another similar catastrophe.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

InterviewPascal Soriot of AstraZeneca: ‘The climate crisis is a health crisis’Julia Kollewe,The man who led the drive to create a not-for-profit Covid vaccine is now focusing on the deaths caused by global heating and pollution,,"‘I speak as a healthcare CEO, but also as a nature lover and as a grandfather,” Pascal Soriot, chief executive of Britain’s biggest drugmaker, AstraZeneca, told King Charles III and a select audience during London Climate Week at an event in the gothic grandeur of Guildhall.While the Covid-19 pandemic led to the loss of 7 million lives globally, Soriot says that the climate crisis and pollution “cost us 7 million to 9 million lives every year”.“It’s affecting us all through respiratory diseases, cancers, health conditions, infectious diseases … This crisis is actually a health crisis.”The 64-year-old Frenchman, who has made Australia his home, says the 2019 bushfires there showed him the devastating effects of global heating and spurred him into action: “Even though the bushfires were a fair distance from Sydney, the city was engulfed in smoke.”He has brought together healthcare leaders and pharmaceutical executives in a taskforce for the Sustainable Markets Initiative, initially convened by the king, to speed up the private sector’s zero carbon efforts.Soriot is better known for bringing the first not-for-profit Covid vaccine to the world in late 2020, after AstraZeneca – until then not a leading vaccine maker – teamed up with Oxford University to develop one of the first jabs against the virus.“When [AstraZeneca’s R&D chief] Mene Pangalos and I said ‘Let’s do this vaccine at no profit,’ a lot of people in the company could have told me and Mene: ‘We don’t want to do it, it’s too risky, it’s complicated’,” Soriot says. “I didn’t get that comment a single time. It’s been a massive effort. A few people suffered personally from working hard … We’ve got a great culture, a great team. It’s probably what I’m most happy with.” He was knighted last year for his and the company’s work during the pandemic.I decided I would be a vet when I was five years old, my mother tried to convince me to be a doctorAstraZeneca suffered bad publicity about side-effects and production delays, and chose not to re-engineer its jab as a booster against new virus strains, unlike rivals. A study by health data firm Airfinity estimates vaccine saved 6.3 million lives, versus 5.9 million for the higher-priced Pfizer/BioNTech jab.As the use of its Covid jab declines, there have been suggestions that AstraZeneca may sell its vaccines and immune therapies business. Soriot says this will depend on “whether the technologies [we] work on are successful or not”. Its Covid antibody treatment for people with weak immune systems, Evusheld, was a success initially but, like rival drugs, was found not to work against new virus variants in January. It has since been tweaked, and Soriot is confident that the new version works against all known variants of concern. It could be made available by the end of the year.He reveals that the firm is also working on an antibody for microbial infections, at a time when superbugs – drug-resistant infections – are on the rise.Born in the Paris suburbs – where he has said he got into street fights and learned about loyalty – Soriot trained and worked as a horse vet. “I love horses, always have since I was a child, and decided I would be a vet when I was five years old,” he says. “My mother tried to convince me to be a doctor.”He later decided to combine his interests in biology and business, and began a career in the pharmaceutical industry in Australia in 1986, at the French firm Roussel Uclaf. He also worked in New Zealand, Japan, America and Switzerland, with senior roles at Aventis, Genentech and Roche.AstraZeneca’s Discovery Centre in Cambridge. Photograph: Alecsandra Dragoi/The GuardianAstraZeneca is reportedly drafting plans to spin off its sizeable China business and list it in Hong Kong or Shanghai to shield the company from worsening geopolitical tensions. Soriot refuses to comment on “rumours” but says: “Over the years we’ve always looked at all sorts of things … but 90%, 95% of what we study never happens.”“I know our industry is not affected by these tensions today,” he adds. “And I don’t believe our industry would be directly affected unless the tensions become really, really very bad. But medicines are never under sanction.” He rejects the idea that a separately listed Chinese business would get new drugs approved more quickly.When Soriot joined from Roche in 2012 and took over as chief executive from David Brennan – who was ousted over AstraZeneca’s thin pipeline of new medicines – the firm was the “sick man” of the industry. Little over a year later, its bigger US rival, Pfizer, ambushed the firm with a hostile takeover bid.In the battle to keep AstraZeneca independent – which was waged in public – Soriot claimed that executing a merger with cost savings could delay life-saving cancer medicines and ultimately cost lives.He had been through a major integration himself, as chief executive of Genentech, after the US biotech firm was bought by Swiss giant Roche for $46.8bn in 2009, bringing together “two companies [that] had very different cultures”.Pfizer walked away from its £69bn takeover bid in May 2014, but Soriot then had to deliver on an ambitious revenue pledge.It has been a decade of hard graft since – with Soriot earning nearly £120m in the process – and the company has doubled in size in the last five years.AstraZeneca made a series of smart bets on cancer treatments and other medicines, including Lynparza. Work on the ovarian and prostate cancer drug, now a $2.6bn-a-year sales blockbuster, had been suspended amid doubts from the commercial team, but Soriot decided to “take a risk” and revive it after consulting leading oncologist, José Baselga, who would later join the firm.Under Soriot, the firm ramped up research spending, to $9.8bn (£7.4bn) last year, and restructured R&D into smaller, more autonomous teams akin to healthcare startups. The firm aims to deliver at least 15 new medicines by 2030.He took the decision to close the renowned research centre in Alderley Park in Cheshire, cut a tenth of the workforce and build a new £1bn HQ in Cambridge to bring all scientists under one roof, as part of Europe’s biggest life sciences cluster.AstraZeneca is now the UK’s biggest listed company, with a market value of £163bn – which also puts it ahead of New York-listed Pfizer at $203.6bn (£155bn) – even after nearly £14bn was wiped off Astra’s value over concerns that a new lung cancer drug may not be as successful as hoped.After almost jumping ship to Israel-based Teva in 2017, Soriot is often asked how long he will stay. “I can keep doing this job for many years,” he said last summer.Today, he says: “The exciting aspect of our industry is that, not only do we help people by bringing them medicines that can either cure them or help them live with their disease, but the other exciting piece is that technology and science are evolving constantly. So there’s always something new happening, so you never get bored.

 Nicola Sturgeon starts work on a new push for Scottish independence,First minister unveils legislative programme including referendum and policies agreed with Greens,"['Libby Brooks', ' Scotland correspondent']","Nicola Sturgeon has told civil servants to start making a new case for independence, which offers people “an informed choice on Scotland’s future” in the Scottish government’s first legislative programme since last month’s cooperation deal with the Scottish Greens.Bills to set up a national care service and reform the Gender Recognition Act, as well as proposals for private sector rent controls by the end of this year, all featured in Sturgeon’s plan for the year to come in Holyrood.The legislative programme follows the Scottish election campaign in May and is a look into her plans to fulfil the pledges made both in the SNP manifesto and in the pact signed with the Greens this summer. Sturgeon recommitted to one key plank of the power-sharing deal to hold a referendum on independence within the first half of this parliament and before the end of 2023.Stating that the “immediate priority of this government is to lead Scotland out of the pandemic”, Sturgeon also pledged measures to tackle the country’s continuing stark rates of child poverty, including a delivery plan for “wraparound childcare”, offering care for families on low incomes before and after school and during holidays.It also made good on the SNP manifesto commitment to increase the Scottish child payment from £10 to £20 a child a week “as early within the life of the parliament as possible”.Sturgeon also announced pilots of a four-day working week, backed by a £10m fund for participating companies, work to develop a minimum income guarantee, a consultation on Scots law’s controversial not proven verdict and a miners’ pardon bill to provide a collective pardon for those convicted of certain offences during the 1984-85 strike.But the programme, which is akin to the Queen’s speech in the Westminster parliament, was dismissed by Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar as “a plan that isn’t good enough, it isn’t bold enough and it won’t do enough”.“Barely a week goes by without someone from the government’s frontbenches declaring something mundane, re-badged or self-serving as ‘historic’,” he said. “But the dire truth is that despite the SNP’s rhetoric, the only thing historic today is the levels of child poverty on our streets, the numbers waiting for treatment in our hospitals, and the depth of the economic crisis facing Scotland.”Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton raised particular concerns about a centralised social care service, describing it as “a gimmick and a ministerial power grab. Scottish Liberal Democrats stand with the RCN and other stakeholders who believe these proposals will distract from and delay implementation of other important reforms.”While Cole-Hamilton criticised Scottish Greens for “giving up any premise of opposition”, they insisted that they had “heavily influenced” the programme, pointing to commitments to dedicate at least 10% of the transport budget to active travel by 2024-25 and £1.8bn over the course of the parliament to net zero buildings.",2021-09-07
 A dragonfly: weigher of soulsHelen Sullivan,"Upside down, they resemble a pair of scales",,"Dragonflies have a near-perfect hunting record, successfully grabbing their prey in mid-air 95% of the time: they do this while flying skywards, earthwards, side to side, backwards and upside down. In one experiment, a dragonfly with numbers drawn on its clear wings alights backwards from a reed, legs raised above its head like a person making an offering to God, and scoops up the bug flying behind it. The dragonfly appears to catch its prey both benevolently and malevolently: snatching it and saving it, like a ball or a falling baby.Dragonflies transform from their larval stage with similarly precise acrobatics: the skin splits, the insect wriggles its head and chest out with the awkwardness of someone trying to get into a sleeping bag while standing up, and then it hangs upside down for a while, its tail still trapped in the skin. The almost-dragonfly regains its strength, then does an upside down sit-up at the same time it pulls and flicks its tail out: a perfectly controlled dismount, a precisely calibrated monkey acrobat toy.A bat: In the city, they fly along routes that mirror roads | Helen SullivanRead moreAfter this, it will fly around in its buzzy way for a few months, in Derek Walcott’s words: “In the hot green silence a dragonfly’s drone / crossing the scorched hill to the shade of the cedars”. In Swedish folklore dragonflies are “weighers of souls”: upside down, they resemble scales. Their comprehensive flight round your head is an appraisal, conducted on behalf of the devil, of how badly you have lived your life.The third horseman of the apocalypse, famine, carries scales in his hands to weigh barley, wheat and the souls of those who have died of hunger. In Revelation: “I looked, and behold, a black horse; and he who sat on it had a pair of scales in his hand. And I heard something like a voice in the centre of the four living creatures saying, ‘A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; but do not damage the oil and the wine.’”“Something like a voice.” The horror!The Danish writer Inger Christensen, whose translator compared her to a dragonfly and a goldsmith – the word for both in Danish is guldsmed – wrote: “We as human beings are not only able to imagine a condition of ongoing want, but are also able to maintain this condition of want and moreover to call it life.”How long does a dragonfly live? A few months. But before this, it may have spent up to five years in the larval stage, hunting underwater with snatching jaws. Then one day the nymph grows tired of swimming and decides to do the next best thing: fly. It finds a reed that grows above the water and begins to climb. Its head rises above the water and it stops to catch its breath: its respiration system needs to adapt to inhaling air.

,Photographer Prashanth Vishwanathan captured a network of community dairies helping off-grid farmers in Maharashtra keep milk fresh as temperatures rise. All pictures are from Climate Visuals and Ashden,"['Supported by', 'About this content']","As global temperatures climb, a lack of refrigeration makes a big impact on people trying to make a living from farming. Especially dairy farms.There are more than 75 million smallholder dairy farmers in India. Most are in off-grid areas without refrigeration, or reliant on expensive and polluting diesel generators. This locks people out of national supply chains, and farmers have to spend hours transporting milk to markets, or sell at a lower price to middlemen. In Maharashtra, western India, a network of community dairies has been set up, using sustainable refrigeration technology, where people can bring their milk to be tested, chilled, and sold on.Photographer Prashanth Vishwanathan visited Latur district to see the impact of the centres. “There are huge numbers of farmer suicides in Maharashtra at the moment, because crops are difficult. People are in debt, there is a lot of money to repay. These are marginal farmers. This business opportunity is a lifeline for these communities,” he says.The chilling service in Latur is organised by social enterprise Promethean Power Systems, in partnership with local NGO Swayam Shikshan Prayog (SSP). Promethean’s chillers use batteries incorporating sustainable thermal energy storage technology, making diesel generators redundant.Around the world, low-income communities are most at risk from the climate crisis: higher temperatures threaten their crops and produce, as well as their health. Conventional cooling and chilling is unaffordable for many, and, ironically, the emissions it creates further worsen the crisis. Sustainable cooling for all is fundamental to climate justice.The scale of food wastage in low-income countries is high – 40% of what is produced – with lack of cold chain storage a huge factor. It’s estimated that a billion people do not have access to any type of cooling. For rural farmers that is a big obstacle to selling food in soaring temperatures.Vishwanathan has worked in Latur before, witnessing the environmental threats faced by these communities – threats which will be made worse by the climate crisis.He says: “I photographed drought in the area 10 years ago. People are more educated now, with more access to information. But an economic gap remains.”",2022-10-19
 This article is more than 7 months oldGreta Thunberg: not phasing out fossil fuels is ‘death sentence’ for world’s poorThis article is more than 7 months old,Climate activist says only ‘rapid and equitable’ phaseout will keep temperatures within 1.5C limit,"['Fiona Harvey', ' Environment editor']","Rich countries are signing a “death sentence” for millions of poor people around the world by failing to phase out fossil fuels, the climate activist Greta Thunberg has told governments.She warned on Tuesday that with annual greenhouse gas emissions at an all-time high, only a “rapid and equitable” phaseout of fossil fuels would keep global temperatures within the scientifically advised limit of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.“The coming months and years – right now – will be crucial to what the future looks like. It is what we decide now that will define the rest of humanity’s future,” she told a press conference at UN talks in Bonn, where governments are meeting to discuss the climate crisis.“If we do not [phase out fossil fuels], it will be a death sentence for countless people. It is already a death sentence for countless people,” she said.Thunberg last Friday announced the end of her school strikes, which she has been undertaking on Fridays since 2018 in protest at political inaction on the climate crisis. The campaigner has left school but intends to carry on speaking out on climate issues, while also giving the spotlight to youth voices from the developing world.She said a lack of political will to halt fossil fuel exploration and use was threatening to raise global temperatures by more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, which could lead the climate to pass “tipping points”, a cascade of impacts that could create runaway global heating.“We are still rushing towards the cliff. We could trigger feedback loops that are beyond human control, that would throw countless billions under the bus,” she said.The question of phasing out fossil fuels is expected to be a flashpoint at the Cop28 UN climate talks later this year. The summit will take place in Dubai, hosted by the United Arab Emirates, a major oil and gas producer.Many countries would like to see Cop28 produce a formal resolution to phase out fossil fuels, or at least to discuss such a phaseout as an official agenda item at the summit. But some countries, chiefly fossil fuel producers including Saudi Arabia, are staunchly opposed, and the UAE presidency has been cautious, saying there is not yet agreement on the agenda.Chairing the talks will be Sultan Al Jaber, a minister in the UAE government who is also chief of the country’s national oil company, Adnoc, which is planning a massive expansion of fossil fuel production capacity.Eric Njuguna, a climate justice organiser from Kenya, speaking with Thunberg, said Al Jaber’s dual role was a conflict of interest, and called on him to resign. “It is a stab in the back for poor countries to have a fossil fuel CEO on top of efforts to constrain the climate crisis,” he said.Al Jaber has told the Guardian he will bring a “business mindset” to the talks, and pointed to his role as co-founder of the Masdar renewable energy company in UAE. He visited the Bonn talks last Thursday, and told a public meeting: “The phasedown of fossil fuels is inevitable.” But he stopped well short of promising to put a phaseout of fossil fuels on the Cop28 agenda.The talks in Bonn, which started last Monday and will end on Thursday, are to lay the groundwork for Cop28, the conference of the parties under the UN framework convention on climate change, which begins on 30 November.Progress at Bonn has been slow. Last week’s discussions were characterised by disputes over rich countries that are failing to provide financial assistance to developing countries, to help them cut their greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the impacts of the climate crisis.Alden Meyer, a senior associate at the thinktank E3G, said: “Much more work remains to be done to land an agreement at Cop28 for a just and equitable reduction of fossil fuel production and use in a timeframe that’s consistent with the Paris [agreement] 1.5C goal.”",2023-06-13
‘I needed growing space’: why I escaped to the country,"When landscape designer Jack Wallington and his partner saw this farmhouse in West Yorkshire, they knew it was time to swap London for the countryside",['Jack Wallington'],"In February this year, my partner, Chris, and I left London with a car full of boxes, houseplants and our cat, Rumbles. After 20 years in the capital, we were heading to a new life in Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, to grow organic produce and be better connected to nature. Chris grew up in the valley and we felt drawn to the area’s creative scene, rugged landscapes and excellent baked goods.Also, I am a gardener. The southern British climate is changing, with hotter, drier summers making gardening conditions harder. Dry spells in spring and summer have become longer and more regular. Certain plants, such as dahlias, salad crops and fruit trees that need moisture, are struggling. Summers have become a watering marathon, choosing which plants to save and which to sacrifice. I started switching to drought-tolerant flowers and edibles, such as Hylotelephium, figs and herbs.The tranquil view over the Calder valley. Photograph: Tessa Bunney/The GuardianMoving to Yorkshire was part of a five-year plan Chris came up with when we were in our mid-30s (he is now 42 and I’m 39). It started to become reality in January 2018 when I gave up my career in online publishing to become a full-time landscape designer. I’d opened my studio part-time a year earlier when friends asked me to help with their gardens.The pandemic brought our move forward. London lockdowns weren’t all bad, thanks to outside space. Our 40sq metre garden, directly under the Heathrow flight path, turned miraculously quiet save for birdsong. And my allotment, more than seven miles away – where I grew vegetables, fruit, herbs and cut flowers – became my sanctuary. Gruelling 15-mile round trips on a friend’s bike carrying veg and cut flowers along empty roads lined with cow parsley, when the world was falling apart, are my lasting memory.But I felt I couldn’t garden like this any more; I needed growing space on our doorstep. Our millionth lockdown walk around Clapham Common made us realise that we were living the wrong way around, cut off from the countryside. The sooner we moved to Yorkshire, the better.Jack (right), Chris and Alison the hen outside the chicken shed. Photograph: Tessa Bunney/The GuardianLast September, Chris phoned me while on a house-hunting visit to his parents. “I think this is the one,” he said. I jumped on a train the following morning and found myself overwhelmed by the little farm Chris had seen, in our dream location, within walking distance of Hebden Bridge.It is a 17th-century farmhouse, situated 1,000ft above sea level with views across a woodland canopy and the Calder valley beyond. All our electricity is from renewable sources, including local windfarms, and we’re exploring other sustainable sources, such as geothermal heating, to minimise our carbon footprint.It has 2.6 hectares (6.5 acres) of land, more than we’d hoped for: 660 times the size of our London garden. It has a patio with a spot for a herb garden by the kitchen door, and a sheltered domestic garden, about 10m x 30m, with a lawn and flower borders where I can experiment with planting. Beyond this lies an informal wildlife garden with a pond and a polytunnel, leading down to a coppice woodland and orchard. It loops back across a wildflower hay meadow to allotments.The owners, Ben and her partner Sally, had raised their children here, and pioneered a sustainable and wildlife-friendly smallholding, keeping hens and growing blueberries, raspberries and kale. Their wildlife garden contained foxgloves (Digitalis purpurea), primroses (Primula vulgaris) and cow parsley (Anthriscus sylvestris) and, to my delight, a 2-acre hay meadow had yellow rattle (Rhinanthus minor), knapweed (Centaurea nigra) and ox-eye daisy (Leucanthemum vulgare). They had installed solar panels on the farmhouse roof to heat water, and the productive coppice shelters an orchard that slows water runoff to the flood-prone valley below.The allotment. Photograph: Tessa Bunney/The GuardianWe plan to keep the land’s focus on helping wildlife, the climate and growing as many wildflowers as space allows. Insect, bird and mammal populations have declined by as much as 68% in the last few decades, while two in five plants are threatened with extinction due to pesticide use in farming, continuing habitat destruction and climate change.The coppice and wildflower meadow, around 1.6 hectares (4 acres) of the plot, will coexist for wildlife foremost, while providing wood as well as hay to feed livestock for other local farmers. Everything else is for vegetables, fruit and herbs. I planted potatoes in mid-April, a month later than I would down south, and I’ll scrape earth over the growing shoots until frost-free nights are forecast.I’ve also planted a large variety of salad crops including lettuce, mibuna, mizuna and mustard in the allotment. I’ve sown hardy broad bean ‘Aquadulce Claudia’, pea ‘Oscar’, chards ‘Pink Flamingo’ and ‘Fordhook Giant’, and root veggies carrot ‘Flyaway’ and parsnip ‘Gladiator’.Early signs of growth in the polytunnel. Photograph: Tessa Bunney/The GuardianRhubarb grows particularly well in this part of the world and we’re lucky to have an existing unknown variety, plus a generous fruit cage of goodies including blueberries. These need acidic soil and in London that meant growing in ericaceous peat-free compost in pots, but here they flourish – though brassicas such as cabbage and broccoli, which prefer alkaline soils, are a challenge. All fruits will have a generous 5cm layer of well-rotted manure added to the soil around them as an organic fertiliser.On our window sills, waiting for nights above 5C, are tomato, chilli, aubergine, courgette and squash plants. Directly outside the kitchen, I’ve begun growing a herb garden with the aim of supplying all our herbs: white-flowered rosemary, sage, chives, a number of mints and angelica. From seed I’m growing chamomile, thyme, basil, dill, fennel, cumin and parsley.We adopted two chickens from Ben and Sally, and plan to rescue a few more former battery hens for free range eggs. Nothing says “farmer” like shepherding our flock of two, who have started laying beautiful speckled eggs.The challenge of smallholdings with a view is that they are invariably on hillsides, exposed to wind, rain and ice. However, we know this land well, and carefully calculated the exact position we needed to grow: a south-facing slope, which warms up quickly, tucked just low enough into the valley to be shielded from the harshest weather.Key to exposed gardens is shelter, from dry stone walls, trees, shrubs and hedges. Tough hedges such as Ligustrum ovalifolium (privet), Griselinia littoralis and indigenous Ilex aquifolium (holly) weaken winds to create sheltered microclimates, increasing the range of what you can grow. Deciduous Prunus spinosa (blackthorn) and Sambucus nigra (elder) are great, too – bees love their flowers and birds the berries.Potting on a chilli plant. Photograph: Tessa Bunney/The GuardianSpring in Yorkshire is a month later than London, autumn a month earlier, and I confess to a sense of relief at this shorter growing season. Summer can be manic in the garden because of watering, weeding and mollycoddling edibles – the most labour-intensive plants – especially alongside my work on other people’s gardens. However, I will extend growing into winter using the polytunnel, hopefully a greenhouse and horticultural fleeces and cold frames.Polytunnels and greenhouses can be used for growing heat-loving tomatoes, aubergine, peppers and chillies in summer; and, in winter, for protecting hardy salad crops such as lettuce, mizuna and mustards.‘Unorthodox and magical’: how tree stumps can transform your gardenRead morePests are on a different scale from London’s snails and squirrels: deer leap over walls, rabbits hop threateningly closer to our veggies and the fences to keep them out around the perimeters will eventually need replacing. But the extra space makes gardening far easier – a shed for tools, a polytunnel to grow large quantities of seedlings.Every evening we go for a walk directly from our door, over hills and moors, or into woodland valleys. We have seen a barn owl, bluebells, sunsets and stars. Stars! Hidden from us for two decades by London’s light pollution.Of course, we miss our friends, Clapham’s community and our little urban garden full of happy memories. We’ve much to learn: Chris needs wellies, and the winters will be harsh. But now we can visit the city from the countryside, rather than the other way around. Life is about balance, and the scales have tippedSix ways to get started on a bare plotWeed If your plot has bare soil, hoe or remove weeds by hand, especially their roots.Mulch soil Add 3cm of peat-free compost. Well-rotted manure can also be used but must be left for a couple of months; if fresh it can burn roots.Lettuce seedlings. Photograph: Tessa Bunney/The GuardianSow crops in module trays You can sow crops directly in soil in summer but I find it helps to sow many crops in pots or trays of peat-free compost, too. It allows you to protect them from slugs and snails. Sow fast-growing crops such as lettuce, spinach and beetroot in trays with separate cells, and larger pea, bean, courgette and squash plants into individual 9cm pots.Start composting A compost heap is top priority. Recycle garden waste (one-third green material to two-thirds brown and woody) for next year. Shred large bits of wood.Create new areas To start a new veg or flower bed, cover an area of lawn or weeds with card and a 5cm layer of compost on top. This will slowly kill the plants beneath by starving them of light. Plant seeds or plugs directly into the compost (immediately is fine); roots will grow through the damp card.Observe and record In the first year, watch what grows and how the sunlight falls through all seasons before making big changes.

,The story of the damage done to the world’s biodiversity is a tale of decline spanning thousands of years. Can the world seize its chance to change the narrative?,"['The age of extinction is supported by', 'About this content']","The story of the biodiversity crisis starts with a cold-case murder mystery that is tens of thousands of years old. When humans started spreading across the globe they discovered a world full of huge, mythical-sounding mammals called “megafauna”, but by the end of the Pleistocene, one by one, these large animals had disappeared. There is no smoking gun and evidence from ancient crime scenes is – unsurprisingly – patchy. But what investigators have learned suggests a prime suspect: humans.Take the case of Genyornis, one of the world’s heaviest birds, which was more than 2 metres tall and weighed in excess of 200kg. It lived in Australia until, along with many other megafauna, it went extinct 50,000 years ago. In North America, giant beavers weighing the same as a fridge and an armadillo-like creature called a glyptodon, which was the size of a small car, existed until about 12,000 years ago, when they, too, went extinct. In all, more than 178 species of the world’s largest mammals are estimated to have been driven to extinction between 52,000 and 9,000BC.For a long time, these extinctions were thought to be linked to natural changes in the environment – until 1966, when palaeontologist Paul S Martin put forward his controversial “overkill hypothesis” that humans were responsible for the extinctions of megafauna, destroying the romantic vision of early humans living in harmony with nature.Prof Mark Maslin, from University College London (UCL), suggests that the unsustainable hunting of megafauna may have been one of the driving forces that led humans to domesticate plants and animals. People started farming in at least 14 different places, independently of each other, from about 10,500 years ago. “Weirdly enough, I think the first biodiversity crisis was at the end of the last ice age, when early humans had slaughtered the megafauna and therefore they’d sort of run out of food, and that precipitated, in many places, a switch to agriculture,” he says.Although the debate is far from settled, it appears ancient humans took thousands of years to wipe out species in a way modern humans would do in decades. Fast forward to today and we are not just killing megafauna but destroying whole landscapes, often in just a few years. Farming is the primary driver of destruction and, of all mammals on Earth, 96% are either livestock or humans. The UN estimates as many as one million plant and animal species are at risk of extinction.After the spread of farming and significant population increases, it was European expansion that would be the next big blow to the planet’s biodiversity. While Indigenous peoples across the world lived mostly within the limits set by nature, recognising their dependency on it and protecting it, while hunting to survive, all that was about to change.A man stands on a pile of buffalo skulls as another rests his foot on one at a glue factory in Rougeville, Michigan, 1892. Photograph: APSpanish explorers and settlers arrived in central and southern America in the 15th and 16th centuries. In The Human Planet: How We Created the Anthropocene, Maslin and Prof Simon Lewis, also from UCL, describe maps of that time showing large tracts of lands with not much on them. These places already had names, but the Europeans claimed them for themselves. “Religion and notions of the superiority of Europeans loomed large as justifiers of both the conquest of land and the names themselves. The heyday of geologists naming vast portions of Earth’s history was also the European colonial era,” they write.Their arrival also heralded the displacement, persecution and killing of Indigenous peoples. Researchers from UCL, including Maslin and Lewis, found the European colonisation of the Americas caused the death of 56 million people by 1600 – 90% of the Indigenous population. Today, Indigenous people make up just 6% of the world’s population but protect 80% of the planet’s biodiversity.Humans use everything up without renewing anythingGeorges-Louis Leclerc, French naturalist, 1778European scientists’ interest in the diversity of life peaked in the Victorian era. Great natural history museums are testament to this excitement of discovery – they wanted to show off the exotic animals and plants collected from all over the British empire to the public at home. For the first time, they began to understand the immense diversity of the natural world and that humans were destroying it.In the 18th century, one of the most significant missions to understand the diversity of life on Earth was that of the Swedish natural philosopher Carl Linnaeus. He is known as the “father of taxonomy”, naming more than 12,000 species of plants and animals. His Systema Naturae, published in 1735, still shapes how we classify flora and fauna today. Modestly, he is said to have commented: “God created, but Linnaeus organised.” To be fair, he was pretty much right.The 18th century was also when people realised humans were having big local impacts on the climate and environment. In 1778, the French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc noted the decimation of fish populations and destruction of forests, warning that humans “use everything up without renewing anything”, according to one account in Elephant Treaties: The Colonial Legacy of the Biodiversity Crisis, by Rachelle Adam.Radeau de la Rivière de Guayaquil by Alexander von Humboldt, an explorer who recognised human destruction of nature. Photograph: Alexander von Humboldt/Wellcome collectionAt the end of the century, the explorer Alexander von Humboldt was on the loose. He was writing at a time when nature was generally seen as something that humans had to control, but he saw that it was humans who had the power to damage ecosystems and the climate through activities such as deforestation, mining and water extraction.His work was a great inspiration for Charles Darwin. The British naturalist did not use the term biodiversity (which wouldn’t be coined for another 150 years) but he had worked out a key premise of it – that all species are linked and can be traced back to a single origin, as most notably laid out in On the Origin of Species, published in 1859. The decline of specific species was turning into an understanding about the broader, more far-reaching impacts of ecosystem decline, because of this premise that everything is connected.In 1881, Darwin published a book about earthworms in which he showed how they aerate the soil, breaking down organic matter into nutrients that can be used by plants. He proved agriculture – and, therefore, our food supply – is heavily dependent on the amount of worms that we have. “That kind of analysis was already there,” says Ted Benton, emeritus professor of sociology at the University of Essex. “But there is a distinction between the analysis being there and how far it is widely understood. And furthermore, how far that understanding filters into government action. That’s what makes a difference.”Neither Humboldt nor Darwin were activists, unlike Darwin’s collaborator, Alfred Wallace. In his book Island Life, published in 1880, Wallace criticised the “reckless destruction of forests, and with them of countless species of plants and animals”.A lithograph depicting 17th-century explorer Jacob Cornelis van Neck’s voyage to Mauritius, showing the soon-to-be extinct dodo bird. Photograph: Album/AlamyAlthough often critical of colonialism, slavery and the destruction of ecosystems, these early explorer scientists were products of that world. The colonialists needed people capable of deciphering the ecology of new territories, for commercial interests and for the health and safety of those onboard the ships.Scientists are still debating the official start of the Anthropocene, but some argue that it began towards the end of the 18th century with the advent of the industrial revolution. The majority believe it was more like the 1950s, with the testing of nuclear weapons and the start of the “Great Acceleration”, when destructive human activity surged across the planet. It marks a period when humans (“anthropo”) have altered the planetary boundaries to such a degree it has its own geological epoque.In the 20th century, a series of natural crises made people more aware nature was under threat, as the planet started being damaged at a faster rate than ever before. The “roaring 20s” gave way to the “dirty 30s” with a decade of dust storms in the US and south-east Australia. In 1935, the dramatic dust clouds of the American midwest loomed over New York and left three-quarters of western states parched. They were caused by a combination of extreme weather – heatwaves and drought – and unsustainable farming practices, which replaced native prairie vegetation.An abandoned farm in the dust bowl near Dalhart, Texas, June 1938. Photograph: Dorothea Lange/FSA/OWI Collection/Courtesy of Library of CongressEcologist Francis Ratcliffe was sent from London in 1929 to find out more about what was going on in Australia and later wrote Flying Fox and Drifting Sand. He described soil erosion as a “creeping mortal sickness” and said the only solution was to reduce the number of farmers in the area. In response to his reports, soil conservation bodies were created in New South Wales in 1938 and Victoria in 1940.After the second world war, amateur naturalists started documenting a decline in birds and butterflies. In the US, populations of the bald eagle – the national bird – were rapidly falling. Synthetic pesticides developed during the war, including DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane), used to prevent insect-borne diseases such as typhoid and malaria, were identified as the culprits as more insecticides were used in the push to intensify agriculture.Rachel Carson, author of Silent Spring, a book which led to the establishment of the US Environmental Protection Agency. Photograph: Erich Harthann/MagnumBut it was probably not until the publication of Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring in 1962 that the wider public began to understand the implications of the loss of nature. She wrote about how DDT and other chemicals were damaging ecosystems, killing insects and birds and eventually reaching humans.Immediately there was great public interest. She was sued by American chemical giants who launched a publicity campaign that criticised her for being an unmarried, hysterical and unscientific woman who kept cats and loved birds. Oil and gas giants used similar tactics to distort science on the climate crisis from the 1980s onwards.In 1972, DDT was banned in the US, and today a ban on its use in agriculture is worldwide. Carson’s book led to numerous laws being passed to protect the environment as well as the creation of the US Environmental Protection Agency. In 1969, Friends of the Earth was set up in the US and two years later Greenpeace was founded in Canada. Awareness about the environment was at an all-time high.Meanwhile, in the UK, a popular TV presenter was seen lying down beside a mountain gorilla, called Poppy, in Rwanda. It was 1979 and the presenter was David Attenborough, whose series Life on Earth was watched by 25 million people. For the first time, huge swathes of the public witnessed lifeforms they never could have imagined and learned about wildlife far away.“I think that was an iconic moment, particularly in the UK,” says Maslin. “It starts off as the importance of these as species … I don’t think it was until much later that we realised that ecosystems are essential for the functioning of the biosphere.”David Attenborough on location with mountain gorillas during the filming of Life on Earth in Rwanda, 1979. Photograph: John Sparks/NPLIn 1989, the then prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, made a 30-minute speech to the UN about the importance of the environment. She spoke about the ozone layer, acid rain and climate change and mainstreamed issues previously associated with “tree-hugging weirdos”.A trio of biodiversity researchers – Richard Leakey, Edward O Wilson and Thomas Lovejoy, who all died in the space of 10 days over Christmas and new year 2021 – were key in driving forward an awareness about threats to the natural world. Lovejoy persuaded famous people such as Tom Cruise to go the Amazon to raise awareness of its immense diversity and why it needs protection.We may well witness the summary demise of … one half of our fellow speciesNorman Myers, the Guardian, 1987The term “biological diversity” appears to have been used for the first time in 1916 in an article by J Arthur Harris titled The Variable Desert, but it was not until 1980 that Lovejoy used the term in scientific work. It was picked up rapidly and contracted to biodiversity in the mid-80s, although there is some dispute about the exact date. Scientists found the term useful to communicate the fundamental problem of the decline of nature – the loss of natural variety.In 1986, nine prominent US scientists attending the National Academy of Sciences forum on biodiversity warned that species loss was the most serious challenge facing the world, “second only to the threat of thermonuclear war”. The first mention of “biodiversity” in the Guardian was a write-up of that conference.Libby Robin, emeritus professor at the Australian National University, notes that this was before the public had picked up that the climate crisis was an issue. She says: “Climate scientists (physicists) elsewhere were starting to be concerned about carbon/global warming but this emphasis came later in the public mind, particularly with James Hansen’s message to the American Congress at the height of the hot ‘greenhouse’ summer in 1988.”The Guardian, 28 Jan 1972: The prophets and doom by Anthony Tucker on biodiversity and pollution. For a pop-out version that can be resized, please follow this linkLooking back at Guardian coverage, it is clear scientists were communicating how alarming the situation was 50 years ago. In 1972, American biologist Barry Commoner was quoted as saying that the “rate of exploitation of the ecosystem, which generates economic growth, cannot increase indefinitely without overdriving the system and pushing it to the point of collapse”.Many ideas we perceive as “new” are not. In 1980, Prof Norman Moore wrote a piece about “biological diversity” in the Guardian (the first time the term appeared in the paper) about how to make compromises that would promote productive farming and conservation, which sounds very familiar to current discussions about the British government’s proposed subsidy system (environmental land management schemes, or Elms) to encourage nature-friendly farming.Moore wrote: “Generalised statements about the desirability of conserving wildlife will have no effect unless we can order our affairs so that the individual farmer can be helped to conserve wildlife on particular bits of ground.” He suggested the best agricultural land should be used for farming, while less productive places should be given over to wildlife.The Guardian, 3 June 1982: Bombs do not renew resources. For a pop-out version that can be resized, please follow this link Photograph: The GuardianIn 1982, the Guardian wrote about the Brandt Report, that said: “Few threats to peace and survival of the human community are greater than those posed by the prospects of cumulative and irreversible degradation of the biosphere on which human life depends.” In the same article, British environmentalist Norman Myers, who was responsible for a lot of the Guardian’s early biodiversity coverage, wrote about the importance of soils, water, forests, grasslands and fisheries as ecosystems that “underpin our material welfare”. If a nation lost them “its economy will quickly decline”, he said. This is the basic premise of the landmark and much-celebrated Dasgupta review, published almost 40 years later, in 2021.In 1987, Myers wrote that “life may be in its death throes”. He said: “Within the lifetimes of many readers, we may well witness the summary demise of at least one quarter, and possibly one half, of our fellow species.” He wrote about a statement from the US National Academy of Sciences written at the time. “They are unanimous in their view that we already have enough scientific information to urge political leaders and policymakers to get to vigorous grips with the extinction crisis forthwith.”So people had recognised biodiversity loss, and its importance, but what to do about it?Dead forest in Poland’s Karkonosze mountains, caused by acid rain pollution, 1990. Photograph: Christopher Pillitz/Getty ImagesOne of the first and most important organisations set up to try to protect biodiversity was the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It was founded in the French town of Fontainebleau in 1948, and supported the creation of international law to protect the planet’s wildlife.Today, the IUCN is a leading force in shaping international conventions, developing rules and principles for conservation and management of ecosystems. It first established its Red List of Threatened Species in 1964, as a way to mobilise funding and experts to tackle extinction threats. It continues to be the global authority on biodiversity loss, regularly releasing reports and updates.The IUCN helped push through legislation to tackle wildlife loss by creating the first draft of what would become the UN’s convention on biological diversity (CBD).The birth of the CBD was at the Rio conference in 1992, when the UN created the conventions on climate change (IPCC), biodiversity (CBD) and desertification (UNCCD). It was a moment of celebration. The conference involved many world leaders and there was general recognition our form of civilisation was exhausting the world we depend on. The first draft was based firmly on the idea that “biodiversity was a global and common heritage”, writes Adam.An orangutan seeks refuge from bulldozers as they destroy the forest in Ketapang district, West Borneo. Photograph: International Animal RescueThe three goals of the CBD are: the preservation of biological diversity; the sustainable use of its components; and fair and equitable sharing of the benefits of genetic resources.Every 10 years, it aims to set targets on biodiversity for the following decade. But the targets are not legally binding and the world failed to meet a single one of the 20 set out at Aichi in Japan in 2010.Which brings us to today and nature’s next big moment – the UN biodiversity conference Cop15, which will be held for two weeks in Montreal, Canada, from 7 December. The more than 20 targets expected to be set will probably include preserving 30% of land and sea for nature by 2030, reducing the rate of introduction of invasive species by 50% and cutting pesticides by at least two-thirds.The meeting comes weeks after the Cop27 climate meeting in Egypt. Ever since the Rio summit, biodiversity has taken second place to the climate on the international stage. But it is increasingly being recognised that the two crises cannot be separated.Cop26, the UN climate conference held in Glasgow in 2021, included a special day for nature, the first time biodiversity and the climate crisis were linked at the international level. Destroying biodiversity by chopping down forests also results in carbon being released, while climate change in the form of extreme weather, such as droughts and heatwaves, damages ecosystems. Some think the two crises never should have been split. “I’m not sure that we should be placing biodiversity loss and climate change in separate boxes; they are all part of the planetary crisis that human activities have caused,” says Adam.The climate crisis generally gets more media attention because flooding and fires make headline news, whereas biodiversity loss is harder to see.The effects of soil erosion on farmland in Shottisham, Suffolk, UK. Photograph: Clynt Garnham  Environmental/AlamyVictor Anderson, a visiting professor in sustainability at Anglia Ruskin University, also argues biodiversity loss has been seen by some as a middle-class, trivial or even rightwing issue. He says: “There has been a connection between nature conservation and the aristocracy. In the 19th century, the protection of the countryside came about because of responses to rising industry. And then there is also the big game issue. If you look back at the beginning of WWF, it’s really well-off people wanting large African animals to continue, in some cases because they still wanted to hunt them.”He says the issue continues to be difficult, not least because every aspect of industry is entwined with nature’s destruction. “I think tracing through the causes of biodiversity loss is a bit frightening, because it does lead you to the whole way in which the world economy operates.”The story of the biodiversity crisis is a tale of decline spanning thousands of years. From hunting huge mammals to extinction to poisoning birdlife with pesticides, humans have treated nature as an inexhaustible resource for too long. Environmentalists, Indigenous peoples and scientists have been sounding the alarm about the biodiversity crisis for more than half a century, and yet no meaningful action has been taken. Much has already been lost, but there is still lots to play for. Cop15 is an opportunity to start to change the narrative.

 This article is more than 2 months oldFossil fuel firms spent millions on US lawmakers who sponsored anti-protest billsThis article is more than 2 months old,"About 60% of oil and gas operations protected from protest due to money spent on lobbying, says Greenpeace USA report","['Nina Lakhani', '@ninalakhani']","Fossil fuel companies have spent millions of dollars on lobbying and campaign donations to state lawmakers who sponsored anti-protest laws – which now shield about 60% of US gas and oil operations from protest and civil disobedience, according to a new report from Greenpeace USA.Eighteen states including Montana, Ohio, Georgia, Louisiana, West Virginia and the Dakotas have enacted sweeping anti-protest laws which boost penalties for trespass near so-called critical infrastructure, that make it far riskier for communities to oppose pipelines and other fossil fuel projects that threaten their land, water and the global climate.How criminalisation is being used to silence climate activists across the worldRead moreAnother four states have enacted narrower versions of the same law, but which could still be exploited to issue trumped-up charges against peaceful protesters. Many were based on a “model bill” promoted by the industry-funded American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec).According to the report, nine of the top 10 companies that lobbied most for anti-protest bills since 2017 are fossil fuel companies, including US companies ExxonMobil, Koch Industries and Marathon Petroleum, as well as Canadian companies Enbridge and TC Energy (Trans Canada).In addition, 25 fossil fuel and energy companies have contributed more than $5m to state anti-protest bill sponsors in this timeframe, data from political finance trackers Open Secrets and Follow the Money shows.According to Dollars v Democracy 2023: Inside the Fossil Fuel Industry’s Playbook to Suppress Protest and Dissent in the United States , a playbook of tactics has been deployed by corporations, law enforcement agencies and fossil fuel-friendly lawmakers in the US since the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) protests at Standing Rock in 2016. This includes mass arrests, spurious litigation, intelligence sharing, harsh policing tactics such as water cannons and sophisticated public relations efforts to depict activists as troublemakers and extremists, the report says.It’s part of a global strategy reported by the Guardian to silence, discredit and criminalize environmental activists and Indigenous rights defenders opposed to polluting energy, mining and other extractive projects that are incompatible with meaningful climate action.“We are seeing an escalation of tactics to criminalize, bully, and sue those working for climate action, Indigenous rights and environmental justice… [as] oil and gas companies find new ways to delay the transition to clean energy and protect their own profits,” said Ebony Twilley Martin, the executive director of Greenpeace USA. “Frontline activists should not face extreme, life-altering legal risks for putting their bodies on the line to keep our planet habitable.’Since 2017, more than 250 anti-protest bills have been introduced in 45 states including legislation to eliminate driver liability for hitting protesters and create felony offenses for demonstrations construed as riots, according to the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law (ICNL).The bills appear to have proliferated as a response to prominent student, environmental and racial justice movements such as Standing Rock and Black Lives Matter, and experts say they restrict the first amendment protected right to free speech, assembly and protest.Anti protest laws in the US Lawmakers have claimed that the bills are needed to prevent violence, despite the laws banning violent acts and property damage already existing while the overwhelming majority of protests in the US are nonviolent.In Minnesota, law enforcement – which along with other agencies received millions of dollars in payments from the Canadian company Enbridge behind Line 3 – more than 1,000 arrests were made between December 2020 and September 2021 as nonviolent protesters tried to stop the rerouting and expansion of the 1,097-mile tar sands oil pipeline through Indigenous lands and waterways. At least 967 criminal charges were filed including three people charged under the state’s new critical infrastructure protection legislation.Fossil fuel firms are also increasingly using civil litigation to intimidate activists and chill legitimate dissent, according to the new report.Greenpeace found that about 75% (86 out of 116) of known Slapps – strategic lawsuits against public participation – and other forms of judicial harassment cases since 2010 were linked to companies that have also lobbied for anti-protest criminal laws including ExxonMobil, Chevron and TransCanada. The Slapps include a $300m lawsuit filed against Greenpeace US by the US company behind the DAPL, Energy Transfer, which alleges that the non-profit organized the massive Indigenous resistance at Standing Rock. The case, which experts fear could have major ramifications for advocacy, is scheduled to open in North Dakota next summer.This year has marked a further blow to the constitutional right to protest in the US, starting with the fatal police shooting of forest protector and anti-Cop City activist Manuel Esteban Paez Terán in Atlanta in January 2023. It was the first case in US history of police killing an environmental activist while protesting.In September, the Georgia state attorney general indicted 61 community organizers on racketeering charges, alleging that those who peacefully opposed the construction of the sprawling police training complex were part of a criminal enterprise. The officers who peppered Paez Terán with 14 bullets, leaving 57 wounds, will face no charges.Also this year, developers of the Mountain Valley pipeline (MVP) – which will transport fracked gas 300 miles through West Virginia and Virginia – filed a $4m civil lawsuit which seeks to restrict 41 individuals and two organizations from fundraising and other activities alleged to have slowed construction. While in North Carolina a draconian new anti-protest law allows up to 19 years in prison and $250,000 in fines for impeding an energy facility.David Armiak, research director with the Center for Media and Democracy, said the Greenpeace report “exemplifies how the fossil fuel industry exerts its outsized influence over state and local politics to curtail the constitutional right to protest with the goal of extending its profit model”.He added: “As the climate emergency intensifies, policy makers should adhere to the authors’ recommendations and pass anti-Slapp laws, repeal anti-protest policies and ensure that treaties with Indigenous communities are respected.”The American Petroleum Institute (API), an oil and gas industry trade association, said it supported the “public’s first amendment right to peaceful protest” but strongly opposed “any criminal activity or physical violence that could put lives, communities and the environment at risk”.In a statement it added: “We share the urgency of confronting climate change together without delay; yet doing so by eliminating America’s energy options is the wrong approach and would leave American families and businesses beholden to unstable foreign regions for higher cost and far less reliable energy.”",2023-10-25
,"Ahvaz, in western Iran, is one of the world’s most polluted cities. Mohamad Madadi has made it a mission to photograph his home town’s environmental crisisPhotographers by Mohamad Madadi/Middle East Images and words by Finn Blythe","['Supported by', 'About this content']","He vividly remembers the first dust cloud he was engulfed in. “The entire sky turned red. My throat started burning like hell. I couldn’t see because of the tears in my eyes. I was shocked, speechless, totally not understanding what just happened,” said Mohamad Madadi.He was then just a child in his school playground but the choking smog clouds have only worsened in Ahvaz, in Iran’s western province of Khuzestan, his home –and one of the world’s most polluted cities.Now 28, the self-taught photographer has made it his work to capture the eerie atmosphere of the heavily polluted city, as a symbol of Iran’s wider environmental crisis that is having an effect on the nation’s health after years of systemic negligence.
Cars travel along a road through a thick haze in Ahvaz, consistently ranked as one of the world’s worst cities for air pollution
In 2011 Ahvaz was ranked by the World Health Organization as having the worst air quality of any city globally.

Trees that had hung heavy with dates and citrus since the days of Mesopotamia now crumble to ash under the slightest touch, due to a dust-borne fungus.Quick GuideA common conditionShowThe human toll of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is huge and rising. These illnesses end the lives of approximately 41 million of the 56 million people who die every year – and three quarters of them are in the developing world.NCDs are simply that; unlike, say, a virus, you can’t catch them. Instead, they are caused by a combination of genetic, physiological, environmental and behavioural factors. The main types are cancers, chronic respiratory illnesses, diabetes and cardiovascular disease – heart attacks and stroke. Approximately 80% are preventable, and all are on the rise, spreading inexorably around the world as ageing populations and lifestyles pushed by economic growth and urbanisation make being unhealthy a global phenomenon.NCDs, once seen as illnesses of the wealthy, now have a grip on the poor. Disease, disability and death are perfectly designed to create and widen inequality – and being poor makes it less likely you will be diagnosed accurately or treated.Investment in tackling these common and chronic conditions that kill 71% of us is incredibly low, while the cost to families, economies and communities is staggeringly high.In low-income countries NCDs – typically slow and debilitating illnesses – are seeing a fraction of the money needed being invested or donated. Attention remains focused on the threats from communicable diseases, yet cancer death rates have long sped past the death toll from malaria, TB and HIV/Aids combined.'A common condition' is a Guardian series reporting on NCDs in the developing world: their prevalence, the solutions, the causes and consequences, telling the stories of people living with these illnesses.Tracy McVeigh, editorWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“It’s a poor city,” says Madadi, “One that has always faced issues as long as I can remember, but where people are always kind and welcoming.”

The surrounding plains, where many of the world’s first cultivated crops were grown, are now barren, poisoned by oil refineries and other extractive industries that have accelerated the region’s ecological breakdown.The growing prevalence of illness that pollution has inflicted on the people of Ahvaz has been examined by several research groups. One 10-year study confirmed growing levels of noxious fumes were behind a rise in cardiovascular hospital admissions, and Madadi has found himself drawn to documenting an increasingly desperate situation.

AnalysisCould Barbados blueprint be a Marshall Plan for the climate crisis?Ashish Ghadiali,"Mia Mottley, PM of Barbados, who, at Cop27 called again for climate justice, is devising a debt relief and loan blueprint, targeting the IMF","['Supported by', 'About this content']","Mia Mottley’s speeches in defence of climate justice dominated media headlines at Cop26 in Scotland last year, where she called on world leaders to seize the moment and deliver on climate action. On Monday she tried again. “We have the collective capacity to transform,” she urged those gathered at Cop27 in Egypt.One of the main targets in the sights of Mottley, prime minister of Barbados, is a new finance solution to the climate crisis, which is swiftly becoming one of the key issues being negotiated at the conference.Prof Avinash Persaud, who has been friends with Mottlysince the 1980s when they were both studying at the London School of Economics, worked with her behind the scenes on the financing plan.Persaud believes the global financial system is simply not set up to deliver on the scale needed to avert climate disaster. He says this puts the burden of climate impacts on the world’s poorest countries, those who are “most pressed to act [and] least able to act”.Barbados, one of the Caribbean nations on the frontline of the climate crisis, is a perfect example of this, and the country’s recent experience of Covid-19 also indicates how, without a paradigm shift in the architecture of global finance, natural disasters translate into bigger debt burdens on those who can least afford to shoulder them.“Covid took our debt from 120% of GDP back to 150%, [from] a level that was heading towards sustainability to a level that was not,” says Persaud.The Caribbean is among the world’s most indebted regions, with debt levels averaging 90.1% of GDP since the beginning of the pandemic. Persaud points out that, across the region, climate shocks and debt continue to feed one another in an unhappy downward spiral.“We found that 50% of the increase in our [regional] debt could be traced back to some natural disaster that we had to pay for ourselves,” he says.Persaud was one of the architects of the post-2008 international banking regulation Basel 3, established in the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse. This proved to be a strategy for fiscal stability that effectively overturned decades of neoliberal financial orthodoxy.“It was a decade of crisis,” says Persaud. He says the solutions promoted by the IMF and the World Bank, such as currency devaluation and rapid debt reduction, meant emerging markets effectively “doubled down” on their vulnerability, increasing the overall level of instability in the system. “People like myself were arguing that we needed a different financial system,” he says, “but no one listened.”The turning point came with the 2008 global financial crisis where, according to Persaud, “because it involved America and Europe more people became willing to accept that booms and crashes were being amplified by finance and that we needed a more shock-absorbing financial system”.Following the quick succession of two category 5 hurricanes, Irma and Maria, which hit the Caribbean within two weeks of each other in 2017, he saw the threat posed by the growing vulnerability of countries situated on the frontline of climate breakdown and already saddled with debt due to decades of structural adjustment.In Dominica, for example, storm damage from Hurricane Maria alone cost the country more than twice its annual GDP. “Climate is the [economic] crisis of today,” says Persaud.Throughout 2022 Persaud has been working with Mottley to draw up a blueprint for a reformed architecture that would speak as poignantly to the leaders of global finance as to communities living on the frontlines of climate breakdown.The evolving proposals, called the Bridgetown Agenda, have seen the pair make inroads into organisations as diverse as the IMF and the Climate Vulnerable Forum, while also winning the support of key figures, including the UN climate champions Mahmoud Mohieldin and Nigel Topping, and the leading economists Nicholas Stern and Vera Songwe.Topping says: “We do need more of a Marshall Plan-type mentality, because this is about growing the global economy and growing global economic stability and global prosperity. If we don’t solve this then we have very bad economic and security outcomes.”Central to Barbados’s proposals is the establishment of a climate mitigation trust that would prompt the release of $650bn from the IMF through a mechanism called special drawing rights, which allows members to borrow from each other’s reserves at very low interest rates.Persaud’s calculation is that if the IMF puts up an initial $650bn, it will stimulate private investment by an additional $2tn, which would get significantly closer to the sums that experts say need to be raised to get on track to stop global heating.Additional features of the Barbados initiative include giving climate-vulnerable countries access to low-interest, long-term loans for adaptation, natural disaster clauses in all bank loans, and grants for loss and damage that would be funded by a 2% tax on fossil fuel exports, shifting the burden from the poorest people in the world directly on to the polluters.As questions of climate finance and implementation move centre stage at Cop27, Persaud hopes this blueprint will be recognised as “achievable, practical, as well as meaningful and morally right”.“In Barbados,” he says, “it’s part of our makeup that we don’t beg. So we’re not coming to the world and begging, we’re coming to world and saying, this will make the world a better place for everybody.”",2022-11-21
 Corporate tree-planting drive in Scotland ‘risks widening rural inequality’,"Surge of estate sales to big firms has driven up prices and increased elitism of land ownership, says report

Lost Forest: why is BrewDog’s green scheme causing controversy?
","['Severin Carrell', ' Scotland editor', '@severincarrell']","A drive by wealthy companies to plant forests in the Scottish Highlands to offset their carbon emissions risks creating even greater inequalities in rural areas, a major report has warned.The analysis says a surge of Highland estate sales to major corporations and cash-rich investors, such as Aviva, Standard Life and BrewDog, has driven up land prices sharply and increased the elitism and exclusivity of land ownership, while they aim to limit climate heating.John Hollingdale, a community ownership expert, argues that much stricter rules on land ownership, tax breaks and forestry subsidies are needed to ensure the rush to meet government forestry and net zero targets has the widest public benefit.The Scottish and UK governments have targets to plant 30,000 hectares (75,000 acres) of new woods and forests across Britain a year. Scottish Forestry, a government agency, is midway through a three-year programme worth £217m to plant 46,500 hectares (115,000 acres) of new woodland by April 2025, roughly equivalent to 93m trees.In a report for Community Land Scotland, a land reform body, Hollingdale said those investments were further subsidised by exemptions from inheritance tax, business property tax relief, and income and corporation tax on profits for commercial woodland, as well as non-domestic rates exemptions.Calum MacLeod, policy director for Community Land Scotland, said: “The paper’s detailed analysis and recommendations shows that green finance mechanisms need to be fit for purpose in terms of a just transition by making land use sustainable in ways that significantly benefit local communities.”Standard Life Investments, Aviva and BrewDog are the best-known examples of companies that have spent tens of millions of pounds in the last year buying land for forestry, peatland restoration and woodland creation to offset their carbon emissions or sell climate-focused investments to their clients.Known as natural capital or green finance investments, corporations have come under intense pressure to absorb or offset their carbon emissions to hit the Paris climate accord goal of limiting global heating to 1.5C by 2050.To the alarm of land reform campaigners and the National Farmers’ Union, that has led to land prices more than doubling in some areas of Scotland, as the competition for upland estates and farmland intensifies.Purchases by big companies such as the beer company BrewDog remain relatively rare but they reinforce another more subtle trend, Hollingdale argues. Increased funding for forestry and its tax advantages means existing owners can increase the value of their land and businesses by moving into woodland creation. While that has environmental benefits, it can make owners less likely to sell, pushing up land values by increasing scarcity.Hollingdale’s report warns this trend also prices out local communities hoping to buy their land to increase local employment, tourism, ecological management and micro-businesses.In 2020, the Scottish Land Fund, which funds community buyouts, stopped taking applications after five months because its £10m budget was oversubscribed. That has since been doubled to £20m, but surging land prices may soon swallow up that increased funding.Hollingdale recommends green financing projects are regulated to ensure they support genuine carbon offsetting; that ministers remove tax exemptions which distort land prices, and increase sales taxes on agricultural buildings; and that land owners are required to produce management plans and introduce public interest tests for large estates.Hamish Trench, the chief executive of the Scottish Land Commission, an official body focused on reforming highly concentrated patterns of land ownership, believes there is a “real risk” green finance investments will further concentrate the ownership of land and its benefits.In 2019, the commission said, just 87 owners – made up of private owners, charities and state-run bodies – controlled 1.7m hectares of rural Scotland. Trench said it was essential the financing was used in the public interest. “How do we harness this new finance coming in so it actively supports the mixed and community ownership model? We see an opportunity to do that,” he said.Sarah Jane Laing, the chief executive of Scottish Land and Estates, which represents many large landowners, said this trend was still in its infancy but had tremendous economic potential. There were still numerous opportunities for community groups and social enterprises to buy land, often with public or private support.“Significant funds could flow into Scotland – benefiting nature, people and jobs,” she said. “Green investment has the potential to provide landowners of all types with revenue streams and community owners and farmers may well benefit from these emerging opportunities. However, these are very early days for all landowners.”",2022-03-08
 This article is more than 9 months oldThousands of shellfish wash up dead on north-east England’s coastThis article is more than 9 months old,Incident at Saltburn-by-the-Sea occurs in same area as number of die-offs reported in 2021 and 2022,['PA Media'],"Thousands more dead or dying shellfish have washed up on a beach on the same stretch of coast that saw a number of crustacean die-offs in autumn 2021 and last year.Visitors to Saltburn-by-the-Sea, a few miles south-east of the River Tees, were met by the sight of hundreds of thousands of dead mussels on the shoreline, as well as starfish, crabs and razor clams.Stuart Marshall, 58, who owns beach huts on the promenade, was mounting a clean-up on the sands. He said: “It’s devastating. There’s starfish dead, clams, oysters and crabs.” He questioned one possible official explanation that rough seas had killed the creatures, as he said the waters had recently been calm.Mystery of England’s crab and lobster die-offs deepens as experts find no clear causeRead moreHelen Whitworth, from Northallerton, North Yorkshire, was walking her border collie Drako on the beach. She said: “There’s all sorts of debris here. I’ve come down for a lovely walk with the dog and it’s such a shame to see all of this today.”There was confusion over a large deposit of black debris, which some said was sea coal, a type of coal that periodically washes up on the beach. Marshall, who has run the huts for almost seven years, said he did not believe the particles were coal, adding: “We do get bits of coal from time to time but not anything like this.”The Environment Agency said its experts concluded the wash-up was “a natural event” and “normal for this time of year”.A spokesperson said: “We can confirm the black substance washed up on the beach is coal deposit, which is not unusual for this stretch of coastline. This is likely to be in the intertidal system for a while given recent weather conditions, so may continue to happen in the coming weeks and months.“Creatures like starfish, razor clams and mussels occupy similar rocky habitat and are easily dislodged during storm events. And the physiology of juvenile flounder makes them vulnerable to being stranded on shallow gradient beaches such as Saltburn.“While we know people are concerned, the combination of recent heavy swell, spring tides and onshore winds means natural wash-ups will occur more often.”The mass die-off on the north-east coast in late 2021 prompted a series of investigations. In January this year, a panel of independent experts convened by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs concluded: “A novel pathogen is considered the most likely cause of mortality.”However, the panel was “unable to identify a clear and convincing single cause for the unusual crustacean mortality”. Some campaigners have feared that dredging for a new freeport on the Tees was linked to the die-off, but the Tees Valley mayor, Ben Houchen, has strongly disputed those claims.",
" China, India and Brazil must set out their plans to cut emissions The Secret Negotiator",An insider says keeping temperatures within 1.5C above pre-industrial levels rests with big developing countries in G20,"['Supported by', 'About this content']","As we get closer to the beginning of Cop26, I worry that the main goal – keeping temperature rises within 1.5C above pre-industrial levels – is slipping away.The Covid-19 pandemic offered the opportunity for a global reset. We could rebuild in a way that was green and with lower greenhouse gas emissions.We have not seen that occur and have squandered that opportunity. Going back to the beginning of 2019, we have had two years to reflect on the reset that we needed, but countries have not done so.We are seeing some bad signs. China looking at burning more coal because of high energy prices is terrible.China and many countries talk about historic responsibility for emissions. Developed countries, such as the US, the UK and other European countries, were burning fossil fuels at high levels for a long time, so most of the carbon that was in the atmosphere in 1992, when the UN framework convention on climate change was signed, came from them.But today China produces about a quarter of global emissions, so it has a historic responsibility.The interests of small developing countries and large developing countries are very different: development versus existence. For the larger developing economies, development is more important than the climate. But for us this is about survival. At 1.5C, it will be difficult but we can adapt. Above 1.5C, we cannot and the impacts will be terrible.Our emissions are very small in global terms. Even if all of we small countries went to zero emissions immediately, that would not have any impact on 1.5C. Even if the big developed countries cut their emissions faster, that would still not take us to 1.5C.Every country is supposed to come to Cop26 with nationally determined contributions (NDCs). But what we have seen from countries is not enough. The present NDCs are not targeting 1.5C. It’s very important that every decision at Glasgow is aligned with 1.5C.Some G20 parties have made the necessary adjustments and they are in line with 1.5C. The G20 is responsible for about 80% of global emissions, but the majority of large developing countries that are members of the G20 have not submitted NDCs that are aligned with 1.5C and many have not submitted NDCs at all.We need the big developing countries that are members of the G20 to come forward now. We have just one week to Cop26, and the G20 leaders are preparing to meet next weekend. China, India and Brazil need to step up to the plate urgently.
Every week we’ll hear from negotiators from a developing country that is involved in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change negotiations and will be attending the Cop26 climate conference.

" US man returns from swift shopping trip to find 15,000 bees in his car","New Mexico man did not initially notice giant swarm, which had got in through an open window while he was inside supermarket",['Guardian staff'],"A man who went shopping in New Mexico returned to a car filled with 15,000 honey bees who had apparently got in through an open window while he spent 10 minutes buying groceries.Astonishingly, the man – who was not named in the New York Times report detailing his unexpected travel companions – did not notice the sudden presence of a giant swarm of buzzing insects on his vehicle’s back seat until he was driving away.“Then he turned back and looked and like was ‘holy cow’,” Jesse Johnson, an off-duty firefighter and paramedic whose hobby is beekeeping, said of the man’s reaction in an interview with the paper. “He called 911 because he didn’t know what to do.”Johnson, and his fellow firefighters, helped the man remove the bees and put them in an empty hive box.He said the bees were likely swarming with a queen and looking for a new home – which makes them more docile and easier to handle as they are not defending their turf.The whole incident passed largely without injury – but not entirely.“One guy got stung on the lip, and we made fun of him the next morning,” Johnson told the Times.",2021-04-04
 Japan scraps mascot promoting Fukushima wastewater dump,‘Little Mr Tritium’ was meant to help win support for release of contaminated water into sea,"['Justin McCurry', ' in Tokyo']","The Japanese government has been forced to quickly retire an animated character it had hoped would win support for its decision this week to release more than 1m tonnes of contaminated water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into the sea.Although the water will be treated before being discharged, it will still contain tritium, a radioactive hydrogen isotope represented on a government website by a cute fish-like creature with rosy cheeks.The character’s appearance in an online flyer and video on the reconstruction agency’s website angered Fukushima residents.“It seems the government’s desire to release the water into the sea takes priority over everything,” Katsuo Watanabe, an 82-year-old Fukushima fisher, told the Kyodo news agency. “The gap between the gravity of the problems we face and the levity of the character is huge.”Riken Komatsu, a local writer, tweeted: “If the government thinks it can get the general public to understand just by creating a cute character, it is making a mockery of risk communication.”Social media users named the character Tritium-kun – or Little Mr Tritium – an apparent reference to Pluto-kun, who appeared in the mid-1990s to soften the image of plutonium on behalf of Japan’s nuclear industry.The reconstruction agency, which oversees recovery efforts in the region destroyed by the March 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown, removed the promotional material on Wednesday, a day after it first appeared.Experts say tritium is harmful to humans only in large doses, and that with dilution the treated water poses no scientifically detectable risk.The character was created to explain that the release of tritium into the sea is standard practice at nuclear power plants around the world.Farewell Little Mr Tritium, feels like we never even got to know you 😥https://t.co/lftwAgBFnM pic.twitter.com/nKLHq37vpP— Martin Hamilton (@martin_hamilton) April 15, 2021
Local fishing communities say the water’s release will destroy a decade of hard work to rebuild consumer confidence in their seafood.Work to release the diluted water will begin in about two years, the government has said, and the process is expected to take decades.“Nuclear power plants are highly specialised and difficult to understand,” an agency official told Kyodo, adding that the tritium mascot would be redesigned to take into account public sentiment.Japan’s decision to discharge the water also angered neighbouring countries. South Korea said it was considering taking the issue to the international tribunal for the law of the sea, possibly to seek an injunction, according to a spokesperson for the president, Moon Jae-in.The Chinese foreign ministry said releasing the water would set a bad precedent for the disposal of wastewater. “The ocean is not Japan’s rubbish bin, the Pacific Ocean is not Japan’s sewers,” said Zhao Lijian, a foreign ministry spokesperson.Zhao invited Japan’s deputy prime minister, Taro Aso, to drink some of the treated water, after Aso said it was harmless enough to consume. “A Japanese official said it is OK if we drink this water, so then please drink it,” Zhao said.",2021-04-16

There she met her husband, Brian Stedeford, through the student Christian movement. They married in 1955.She completed her medical training, specialising in obstetrics and gynaecology, at Manchester University in 1958. She then worked as a GP in Ewell and Surbiton, Surrey, and then, after having two children, she retrained as a psychiatrist, gaining an MRCPsych from Oxford University in 1976.Driven by her faith, she decided she could make best use of her skills by working with the dying, and became one of the first psychiatrists to work in a hospice setting, at Sobell House in Headington, Oxford. She had been seconded there during her training in psychiatry. She found that in a hospice setting she could help people who were suffering in ways that the other staff were less able to do. She stayed there for 12 years.She distilled her experience into a book, Facing Death, published in 1984. The second edition in 1994 included some of her poetry – almost unheard of in a medical textbook.View image in fullscreenAveril Stedeford outside her eco house in Oxford, which won an Observer ethical award in 2006.

For the next few years she practised as a private psychotherapist and continued to explore the relation between religion and medicine, and the control of life and death. She had some of this work and some poems published.After Brian died from cancer in 2003, Averil sold the family home and bought a 1950s semi in Oxford, and set about making it as green as possible. The result was a pioneering retrofit that reduced her home’s carbon footprint by 78%. She was determined not only to minimise the impact of her own home but also to share her experience through open-house tours. For this work, she won an Observer ethical award in 2006.She wrote poetry throughout her life, often exploring grief, loss and death, such as in her collection The Long Way Down (2017), about the loss of her husband. But she also wrote positive, purposeful poetry which she used to bring awareness to causes such as fair trade and environmentalism.In 2012 she suffered a stroke and in 2015 moved to a care home. She continued to care for others by helping her fellow residents.She is survived by her two daughters, Chrissy and Elizabeth, and three grandsons, Simon, Jonathan and me.",2021-07-16
 John Kerry backs UAE appointment of oil chief to oversee UN climate talks ,US climate envoy says pick is a ‘terrific choice’ but activists equate pick to asking ‘arms dealers to lead peace talks’ ,['Associated Press in Abu Dhabi'],"US climate envoy John Kerry backs the United Arab Emirates’ decision to appoint the CEO of a state-run oil company to preside over the upcoming UN climate negotiations in Dubai, citing his work on renewable energy projects.In an interview Sunday with the Associated Press, the former US secretary of state acknowledged that the Emirates and other countries relying on fossil fuels to fund their state coffers face finding “some balance” ahead.However, he dismissed the idea that Sultan al-Jaber’s appointment should be automatically disqualified due to him leading the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. Activists, however, equated it to asking “arms dealers to lead peace talks” when authorities announced his nomination on Thursday.“I think that Dr Sultan al-Jaber is a terrific choice because he is the head of the company. That company knows it needs to transition,” Kerry said after attending an energy conference in the Emirati capital. “He knows – and the leadership of the UAE is committed to transitioning.”Still, Abu Dhabi plans to increase its production of crude oil from 4m barrels a day up to 5m even while the UAE promises to be carbon neutral by 2050 – a target that remains difficult to assess and one that the Emirates still hasn’t fully explained how it will reach.Kerry pointed to a speech al-Jaber gave Saturday in Abu Dhabi, in which he called for the upcoming Cop – or Conference of Parties – to move “from goals to getting it done across mitigation, adaptation, finance and loss and damage”. Al-Jaber also warned that the world “must be honest with ourselves about how much progress we have actually achieved, and how much further and faster we truly need to go”.“He made it absolutely clear we’re not moving fast enough. We have to reduce emissions. We have to begin to accelerate this transition significantly,” Kerry said. “So I have great confidence that the right issues are going to be on the table, that they’re going to respond to them and lead countries to recognize their responsibility.”Each year, the country hosting the UN negotiations nominates a person to chair the talks. Hosts typically pick a veteran diplomat as the talks can be incredibly difficult to steer between competing nations and their interests. The nominee’s position as “Cop president” is confirmed by delegates at the start of the talks, usually without objections.Al-Jaber is a trusted confidant of UAE leader Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. He also led a once-ambitious project to erect a $22bn “carbon-neutral” city on Abu Dhabi’s outskirts – an effort later pared back after the global financial crisis that struck the Emirates hard beginning in 2008. Today, he also serves as the chairman of Masdar, a clean energy company that grew out of the project.Skepticism remains among activists over al-Jaber, however. A call by countries, including India and the United States, for a phase down of oil and natural gas never reached a public discussion during Cop27 in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh in November.Activists worry that Cop being held in a Mideast nation reliant on fossil fuel sales for a second year in a row could see something similar happen in the Emirates.Asked about that fear, Kerry said: “I don’t believe UAE was involved in changing that.”“There’s going to be a level of scrutiny – and and I think that’s going to be very constructive,” the former US senator and 2004 presidential contender said. “It’s going to help people, you know, stay on the line here.”“I think this is a time, a new time of accountability,” he added.",2023-01-16
 This article is more than 9 months oldCalls for action on Colombia’s hippo scourge after animal dies in road crashThis article is more than 9 months old,Dead creature was one of 150 descendants of four hippos imported by drug baron Pablo Escobar in 1980s,"['Luke Taylor', ' in Bogotá']","Colombia has logged its first hippopotamus-caused road traffic accident after a car crashed into one of the animals at high speed, leaving the vehicle mangled and the two-tonne mammal lying lifeless and bloodied across a highway.The hippo was declared dead soon after the crash on Tuesday night in the municipality of Doradal on a highway connecting the cities of Bogotá and Medellín, local environmental authorities said.The car’s driver was reportedly unharmed, though images show that the front end of the vehicle was almost entirely destroyed and debris from the crash and blood from the hippo’s carcass was smeared across the tarmac.The hippo is a descendant of four animals imported from Africa to Colombia by Escobar at the height of the drug lord’s power in the 1980s. Colombia floats new strategy for Escobar’s hippos: ship them abroadRead moreThe beasts escaped following Escobar’s death, and with no predators in the Colombian countryside, they have multiplied into a plague of 150, becoming a threat to local people and a headache for Colombia’s environment ministry.Hippo attacks on people have become more common in recent years, as the animals are highly territorial.Residents in the state of Antioquia live in growing fear of the invasive animals, who are jeopardising the livelihoods of local fishers and endangering the many animal species that inhabit Colombia’s principal river.The aftermath of the crash. Photograph: TwitterThe accident reveals yet another danger that the invasive hippos pose to the local community, said Luz Dámaris Luján, a community leader in Estacion Pita, a municipality 10km away from the scene of the crash.“Everyone around here is terrified because we are flooded with these hippopotamuses. Now we’re at the point where we can’t even go out at night any more,” she said. “The government needs to hurry up and do something, because we are getting tired of this.”Last month, local fishers warned that it was likely only a matter of time before local residents killed one of the animals – although they predicted that it would be with bullets, not a 4x4.Other Colombians mourned the loss of the giant herbivore on social media and lamented the dark legacy of Escobar.“You feel sad for an innocent being that was just passing by. We should all feel guilty, because it is the work of us human beings,” posted Luisa Lozano in response to a video showing the scene of the accident.The invasive species has been a thorny issue for successive Colombian governments. Studies estimate the population could rise as high as 1,400 by 2034, and ecologists warn that they must be culled before they cause more irreversible damage to the delicate ecosystem of the Magdalena river or cause their first human fatality.Recently, local officials have proposed shipping 70 of the animals to zoos and sanctuaries in Mexico and India, though experts are sceptical that the plan will succeed.Aníbal Gaviria Correa, the governor of Antioquia state, who is heading the plan to export Escobar’s hippos, tweeted gruesome images of the crash and called for the president, Gustavo Petro, and the environment minister, Susana Muhamad, to support him in his plans to fly the beasts abroad.“This painful accident reaffirms the importance of urgently translocating the hippos from Doradal to India and Mexico … Please help us with permits for the transfer of these majestic animals,” he said.",2023-04-12
 US launches environmental study for Thirty Meter telescope on Mauna Kea,"Native Hawaiians have protested the $2.65bn project, saying it will further defile an area already harmed by other observatories","['Dani Anguiano', ' and agencies']","The National Science Foundation will examine the environmental impacts of a proposed optical telescope on the summit of Hawaii’s tallest mountain, a project that has faced strong opposition from Native Hawaiians who consider the area sacred.Native Hawaiians have long protested the plan to build what would be one of the world’s largest optical telescopes on Mauna Kea, and say the $2.65bn project will further defile an area already harmed by a dozen other observatories.The Webb telescope: a source of wonder that is both aesthetic and technological | Monica GradyRead moreThe National Science Foundation on Tuesday published a notice of its plans to prepare an environmental impact statement for the $2.65bn Thirty Meter telescope, along with another proposed telescope on Spain’s Canary Islands. It will host several meetings on the Big Island of Hawaii in August and said only after it considers public input, the environmental review and the project’s technical readiness, will it decide whether to fund the project.The international consortium of scientists behind the effort, the TMT International Observatory (TIO), have been moving forward with plans to build the telescope on Mauna Kea for more than a decade and in 2010 completed an environmental study required by Hawaii law for construction on the summit. TIO has proposed constructing the telescope on the Spanish island of La Palma off Africa’s western coast if it cannot build in Hawaii.The Gran Telescopio Canarias, one of the world’s largest telescopes, is located on La Palma, Spain, where TIO has proposed building the Thirty Meter telescope. Photograph: Carlos Moreno/APThe latest study is required under US law in order for the National Science Foundation to invest in the project. TIO, a partnership between the California Institute of Technology, the University of California and government-backed research institutions in Canada, China, India and Japan, plans to obtain $800m, 30% of the estimated cost of construction, from the US government, according to a report.Government funding will allow the entire US astronomy community to access the observatory, Robert P Kirshner, TIO’s executive director, said in a statement.“This ensures that the TIO tests the best ideas and does the most important observations to contribute to understanding where we are in the universe and how it works,” he said.Supporters of the project have argued it will bring jobs and educational opportunities to the area, including via scholarships for Hawaii Island students.Native Hawaiians who have faced arrest and charges for protesting the project say the sacred site should not be further desecrated. “For Native Hawaiians, there is a question of our right to self-determination as defined by international law, but I think it’s so much bigger than that,” Kealoha Pisciotta, a spokesperson for Mauna Kea Hui and Mauna Kea Aina Hou groups, which oppose the project, previously told the Guardian. “It’s about us learning to live and be interdependent.”A police officer speaks to protesters on 15 July 2019 blocking a road at the base of Mauna Kea, Hawaii's tallest mountain. Photograph: Caleb Jones/APPisciotta was critical of the new study, which she said will force opponents to again take time away from their lives to give their views.“Why don’t people accept our ‘no’ for the answer?” Pisciotta said.In a report issued last year, the US astronomy community said the National Science Foundation should invest in at least one or two of a new class of observatories called Extremely Large Telescopes planned by American institutions. The project proposed in Hawaii would cover the skies from the northern hemisphere, while the Giant Magellan Telescope project, based in Chile, would observe the universe from the southern hemisphere.The report deemed the success of the projects critical due to their “transformative scientific potential” and argued that having at least one was “absolutely essential” for the US to remain a leader in ground-based astronomy.The University of Hawaii and the US government began using Mauna Kea for astronomy purposes in the 1970s as its frequent clear nights, dry atmosphere and dark skies make it one of the world’s best locations to observe deep space.

 Greta Thunberg says she will not attend Cop26 climate summit,Swedish activist says uneven Covid vaccine rollout means countries would not participate on even terms,['Agence France-Presse'],"The Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg has said she will not attend the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in November, saying the uneven distribution of Covid-19 vaccines would mean countries could not participate on even terms.The 18-year-old activist said that by November richer countries would be vaccinating young healthy people “very often at the expense of people in at-risk groups in other parts of the world”.“With the extremely inequitable vaccine distribution I will not attend the Cop26 conference if the development continues as it is now,” Thunberg said.Quick GuidePressure on the UK as Cop26 approachesShowPressure on the UK as Cop26 approachesCampaigners and climate experts have been increasingly concerned about a series of government actions that appear to be out of step with the government’s commitment to net zero emissions, ahead of hosting vital UN climate talks, called Cop26, this November in Glasgow. As host and president of the talks, the UK will have to bring squabbling nations together to agree to slash emissions drastically in the next ten years, and reach net zero emissions by mid-century.Rebecca Newsom, head of politics at Greenpeace UK, said the government must reject airport expansion to show leadership at Cop26: “If true, pausing the plans is a sign that the government is starting to clock the catastrophic impacts of this proposed expansion. But we’re just months away from hosting critical global climate talks, and this climate-wrecking mega project is clearly incompatible with our plans to cut emissions, so why only delay the decision and not just call it in now? Quashing the expansion plans before the global climate summit begins would be a real show of climate leadership.”Green groups received assurances from civil servants in 2019 that decisions on new infrastructure that could increase greenhouse gas emissions would take account of the government’s target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. However, the supreme court ruled last December that the government’s commitments under the 2015 Paris agreement could effectively be ignored in the decision to press ahead with a third runway at Heathrow.A group of more than 130 prominent scientists, academics and lawyers, including former Nasa scientist James Hansen, and UK former chief scientist Sir David King, last week wrote to the government expressing concern over the supreme court ruling, and warning that the government’s international climate commitments were being ignored. They wrote: “The highest court in the UK has set a precedent that major national projects can proceed even where they are inconsistent with maintaining the temperature limit on which our collective survival depends. Indeed, the precedent goes further still. It says that the government is not bound even to consider the goals of an agreement that is near universally agreed. Not only does that undermine the UK’s status as a champion of the Paris agreement just ahead of Cop26. It also substantially reduces humanity’s prospects of maintaining that limit and hence averting disaster.”Other recent controversial decisions, such as the government’s initial backing for the Cumbrian coal mine, and a new round of licences granted to extract oil and gas from the North Sea, have also raised concerns. The government has scrapped its main green recovery measure, the green homes grant, which was intended to create thousands of green jobs by helping households to install insulation, and cut incentives to buy electric cars.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Confirming a BBC report, Thunberg said the conference should be postponed “if everyone could not attend in the same terms”. The conference has already been postponed once as it was originally planned for November 2020.However, the campaigner said she did not rule out reversing her decision if vaccine access improved.“Of course, I would love to attend the Cop26. But not unless everyone can take part on the same terms,” she said.Thunberg, who began campaigning against the climate emergency in 2018 at the age of 15, has earned Amnesty International’s top human rights prize and the Swedish Right Livelihood award.

" How many years until we must act on climate? Zero, say these climate thinkersJennifer Francis , Michael Mann , Holly Jean Buck and Peter Kalmus",We asked a panelist of experts on when we need to start changing our economies and ways of consuming and producing. Their answer: now,,"Peter Kalmus: ‘Zero years’We have zero years before climate and ecological breakdown, because it’s already here. We have zero years left to procrastinate. The longer we wait to act, the worse the floods, fires, droughts, famines and heatwaves will get.Don’t blame men for the climate crisis – we should point the finger at corporationsRead moreThe primary cause of these catastrophes is burning fossil fuel. Therefore, we must shut down the fossil fuel industry as quickly as we can. Fossil fuel subsidies must end today. New fracking wells, pipelines and other fossil fuel infrastructure can no longer be built; that we continue on this path is collective insanity. Fossil fuel must be capped and rationed, and diverted to necessities as we transition to a zero-carbon civilization. If we fail, the planet will continue to heat up, creeping past 1.5C, then 2C, then 3C of global heating as we keep squandering precious time. With every fraction of a degree, the floods and fires and heat will get worse. Coastal cities will be abandoned. Ocean currents will shift. Crops will fail. Ecosystems will collapse. Hundreds of millions will flee regions with humid heat too high for the human body. Geopolitics will break down. No place will be safe. These disasters are like gut punches to our civilization.There are tipping points lurking in our future, but it’s impossible to know when they will be triggered. What’s certain is that every day we fail to act brings us closer. Some, like the loss of the Amazon rainforest, may already have been passed.
Peter Kalmus is a climate scientist at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Lab. He is the author of Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution
Jennifer Francis: ‘We cannot wait’We need to immediately stop subsidizing all aspects of the fossil fuel industry. According to this report, the fossil fuel industry received $66bn in 2016, while renewables (excluding nuclear) only received $9.5bn. We should instead use those billions of subsidy dollars to ramp up the renewable energy industry: generation (wind, solar, nuclear), distribution (smarter grid), storage and electric transportation.If we do not succeed in changing our destructive behavior, the increasing trends in extreme weather, sea levels, government destabilization and human misery will continue and worsen.Extreme heatwaves, drought, wildfires and flooding events like those we’ve seen in recent summers will become commonplace. Many coastal cities and communities around the globe will be increasingly inundated by high tides and storm surges. Longer, more intense droughts will destroy cropland and force agricultural communities to uproot their families in search of a better life. The devastation of coral reefs around the world will worsen, wiping out fisheries that provide staple protein for millions of people. All of these impacts are happening now. If we don’t act fast, many communities, cultures and species will cease to exist.
Jennifer Francis is senior scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center
Michael Mann: ‘Strictly speaking, zero’How many years do we have to act? Strictly speaking, zero – which is to say, that we must act, in earnest, now. We have a decade within which we must halve global carbon emissions. As I argue in The New Climate War, this requires dramatic systemic change: no new fossil fuel infrastructure, massive subsidies for renewables, carbon pricing and deploying other policy tools to accelerate the clean energy transition already under way.We are seeing unprecedented public awareness, renewed leadership from the US and diplomatic progress with China, the other of the world’s two largest carbon polluters. There is reason for cautious optimism that we can rise to the challenge. But there is much work to do, and precious little time now to do it. We must now choose between two paths as we face our future. One leads to massive suffering and collapse of our civilizational infrastructure. The other leads to a prosperous future for us, our children and grandchildren. But it requires that we leave fossil fuels behind. The choice is ours.
Michael E Mann is distinguished professor of atmospheric science and director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State University. He is author of the recent book, The New Climate War: The Fight to Take Back our Planet
Holly Jean Buck: ‘We need action now’We need to ramp up action now in order to transform all of our major systems by 2050: energy, transportation, industry, agriculture, waste management. We’ll need to eat less meat, farm in ways that store more carbon in the soils, reforest degraded or abandoned land and restore wetlands.We need to force companies to outfit cement plants and other industrial facilities with carbon capture technologies. When it comes to energy, we need to electrify everything. This means replacing gas-fired heating systems with an electric heat pump in your home and swapping out gas-fired stoves. It means inventing new types of energy storage for those times when the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining, and getting used to responding to the grid – for example, turning down your air conditioning when the power company says there isn’t enough power (or letting them control your thermostat).It means shutting down fossil fuel power plants and ramping up wind, solar, geothermal and probably nuclear, as well as building new transmission lines. Our targets should be 60% renewable electricity by 2030, and 90% by 2050. This means tripling renewable installations by 2030, or installing the equivalent of the world’s largest solar farm every day. If those power lines and solar panels look like they are industrializing the landscape, just think about the less visible but deadly costs of the old infrastructure. Fossil fuel combustion was responsible for 8.7m deaths in 2018.Fossil fuels need to be phased out around the globe. What will people in those industries do? We will need entire new industries in hydrogen and carbon management, industries that turn captured carbon dioxide into fuels and other products as well as store it underground. We can’t just let fossil fuel companies pivot to becoming petrochemical companies, and find ourselves awash in more plastic. We can recycle, use products made from carbon, and innovate new bioproducts. It’s not just an energy transition, it’s a materials transition.And it needs to be global. If we don’t succeed in transitioning away from fossil fuels globally, we could face an uneven world where a few rich countries congratulate themselves for going green, and a few oil producer nations are supplying the rest of the world with dirty fuel, which they use because they don’t have alternatives. In that world, greenhouse gas concentrations keep rising. Climate change exacerbates the risk of war and conflict. It’s hard to measure or model this for exact quantitative projections, but it’s a serious concern. Phasing out fossil fuels, and supporting other countries in exiting fossil fuels, is the best bet for a peaceful future.

 An end to Australia’s iron ore export boom is just what the economy doesn’t need Greg Jericho,"With service industries and foreign tourism decimated, the potential fall in ore prices and demand shows just how much the country relies on mining exports",,"It seems not all that long ago all the talk was about how gloriously the economy was going and how the Covid recession was in the past. But now the two states encompassing 55% of the nation’s economy are in lockdown and the second half of this year looks to be tough for the economy – especially as our iron ore exports might be about to take a hit.One of weird things about the pandemic is that our major exports of iron ore and coal have seen an absolute prices boom:If the graph does no display then click hereThink Morrison was wrong about electric cars and weekends? Wait till you hear him on emissions | Greg JerichoRead moreSo massive was the surge of iron ore prices that in July they averaged a record high of US$214 ($291) per tonne.The news was even better for Australian firms, because while the iron ore price rose, the value of our dollar did not, and so in July the iron ore spot price average was $290.12 per tonne – well above the previous peak of $220 per tonne that was reached just prior to the GFC in November 2007:If the graph does not display then click hereGiven the 2020-21 budget assumed that the spot price of iron ore would “decline to US$55/tonne free on board by the September quarter of 2021”, this has been quite a nice boon for the budget figures.The most recent budget updates published by the Department of Finance showed company tax revenue for the 11 months up to May this year were $2.3bn ahead of what was estimated. That’s a nice pick up (but don’t worry, we will still be in a massive deficit).It does, however, highlight just how our budget and our economy relies on our mining exports.The pandemic of course has been utterly terrible for our services sector – including the exports side of it. International education and tourism have been completely smashed due to people being unable to enter the country.Australia urged to embrace stronger 2030 climate targets in ‘crucial’ fight ahead of Glasgow summitRead moreAs a result, while our iron ore exports have held up, the volume of Australia services exports have fallen back to 2006 levels – a point when our overall economy was roughly two-thirds the size it is now:If the graph does not display then click hereThis collapse meant that while the exports of goods is now just 1% below what it was in the last quarter of 2019, the volume of our services exports is down 44%.Overall, that has meant the volume of total exports is down just over 10%.That was not surprisingly bad news for our economic growth.In the five years prior to the pandemic, we had truly entered the export phase of the mining boom. Exports were nearly equal to households in powering the growth of our economy – which is quite amazing when you consider that household spending makes up about 55% of our economy, and exports a quarter:If the graph does not display then click hereBut that all went kaput when the pandemic hit and our services sector was knocked to the canvas.Since the start of 2020, exports have detracted 1.5 percentage points from GDP growth – ie theoretically if we took out our exports, Australia’s economy grew since December 2019 by nearly 3% rather than the 1.5% it has.The good news is in the last three months of 2020 and the first three months of this year, things have picked up.The IPCC report is a massive alert that the time for climate action is nearly gone, but crucially not gone yet | Greg JerichoRead moreOur services exports kept falling, but goods exports picked up by more than enough, to the point were exports in that six-month period added 1 percentage point to GDP growth – second only to the impact of households spending madly during the lockdowns and on things other than holidaying.So all good? Exports rising, prices rising, win-win? Well, alas, no.In May, the Chinese government had had enough of the record high prices for the biggest component of its steel manufacturing and announced it would crack down on “excessive speculation”.It was not a policy explicitly targeted at Australia, but implicitly it was very much part of the larger trade war between China and Australia.And yet the price carried on at high levels until the start of this month when they plummeted – down 23% on the July highs:If the graph does not display then click hereThe prices now are around US$167 a tonne. And while that is a big fall, it really is only back to the levels in April so it’s not the greatest calamity.Except last week China’s biggest steel producer, Baowu, announced it was cutting production.Pensioner slugged with jobkeeper debt accuses Coalition of double standardsRead moreThere are numerous reasons for this – China is trying to target steel production in order to reduce its carbon emissions; the price of iron ore is also a big cost to its economy; and, heck, it also gives them a chance to slap Australia.What it means, though, is that for the rest of the year, there could be a significant fall in the volume of our iron ore exports as well as further price falls.At a time when our services sectors remain decimated and where foreign visitors are but a hope, this is decidedly not what our economy needed.The latest lockdowns have made us all realise that the pandemic still has a way to go, and that also means the belief that our economy has weathered the storm and is out the other side is also one still to be translated into reality.

 Crayfish behave more boldly after exposure to antidepressants – study,Traces of drugs found in water can make crustaceans more outgoing – but also  vulnerable to predators,"['Natalie Grover', ' Science correspondent', '@NatalieGrover']","Antidepressant drugs in water can alter the behaviour of crayfish, making them bolder and more outgoing, and therefore more vulnerable to predators, researchers have found.Low levels of antidepressants – excreted by humans or disposed of incorrectly – are found in many water bodies. Researchers from the University of Florida assessed the impact of these medicines on crayfish, which are a fundamental component of many aquatic food webs – given they eat almost everything, from plants, insects, leaf litter to small fish (even cannibalising each other).When exposed to low levels of antidepressants, the crayfish were more outgoing – emerging from hiding relatively quicker and spent more time foraging, behaviours that make them more susceptible to predators, according to the study published in the journal Ecosphere.Researchers have long evaluated the impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products that are found in the environment. Often these chemicals are not considered harmful because they are found in concentrations low enough to not kill, but changes in aggression, the ability to smell, and courtship have been observed in animals exposed.In this study, researchers recreated the crayfish’s natural environment in the lab. Two groups of crayfish were placed in artificial streams – one group was exposed to an antidepressant belonging to a family of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), while the control group was not, over a 14-day period.The crayfish exposed to the antidepressants were bolder – more likely to go out and explore and forage. This suggests that in the real world this behaviour could make them more vulnerable to predators and also consume more resources, which could change food web dynamics, said lead author AJ Reisinger, an assistant professor in the soil and water sciences department at the University of Florida.The researchers also measured changes in algal biomass and organic matter, and found that the exposed crayfish increased the amount of algae in the water column of the streams.“We think that’s because they are both stirring up a little bit of sediment on the bottom but also they are excreting when they feed on stuff on the bottom of the stream,” said Reisinger, who conducted the study as a postdoctoral researcher.“So crayfish are changing kind of where and how many different microbial components of the ecosystem are located.”In addition, the researchers evaluated the rate of photosynthesis and energy consumption of entire ecosystem, but found that the presence of the antidepressant didn’t really manifest in any obvious way on the those metrics, he said. “One reason for that might be that we simply just didn’t let the experiment run for long enough, because it takes a little while for the crayfish behaviour to change, and that greatest behaviour change takes a while to affect the ecosystem itself.”Alex Ford, professor of biology at the University of Portsmouth, who was not involved in the study, said the study echoed previous research and that such changes to “normal” crayfish behaviour might mean there is less energy for other activities such as finding mates, evading predators or simply growth.“We also have to remember when wastewater treatment plants are functioning correctly they can’t filter out all these contaminants,” he added, noting that in recent years stormwater overflows are being activated meaning these contaminants are being released into waterways completely untreated.",2018-10-21
"Survivalist gardens and hot-weather fruits among 2024 trends, RHS predicts","Horticulture charity says climate breakdown is influencing trends, based on inquiries from gardeners",['Helena Horton'],"Fruits that thrive in hot weather and can now be grown in the ever-hotter UK summers, and weeds such as cow parsley to decorate borders, are among the 2024 garden trends predicted by the Royal Horticultural Society.Climate breakdown has influenced most of the trends predicted by the horticulture charity, which seeks insights from its more than 600,000 members to forecast which plants may be in fashion in the coming year. While its trends list used to be based on simply which blooms were in vogue, now it highlights the quirks of gardening in a changing climate amid collapsing biodiversity.The predictions are based on horticultural trends and gardener inquiries to the RHS team of gardening advisers and pathology, entomology and botany experts. This year brought the highest number of inquiries the RHS has ever received – 115,000 questions.Recent hot, dry summers have influenced gardeners to try fruits that would ordinarily have failed in the mild UK weather. The RHS said recent years had been “ideal for certain fruits, grape vines being an outstanding example – but others include figs, almonds, apricots, melons, peaches/nectarines and watermelons”.They said, however, that one of the effects of climate breakdown was unpredictable and extreme weather, including harsher downpours of rain, and that the more usual UK-grown fruits including blackcurrants, apples and pears were struggling as they need sustained cold weather in winter to thrive. Garden designers at the RHS have also noted “the recent surge in patio fruit varieties, with dwarf raspberries, blackberries and mulberries”.Fruit and vegetable shortages last year caused by severe drought on the continent have inspired gardeners to grow their own. The RHS said: “After the temporary hiccup to the vegetable supply chain last spring, some gardeners now favour growing with more independence, including where they source their seeds. Localism is playing a stronger role, with some gardening gurus promoting the benefits of seed strains adapted to local climates.”Gardening for wildlife continues to be a big concern for UK RHS members. While in the past, gardening was sometimes a constant battle against so-called “pest” species, a more welcoming attitude has blossomed after people have become more aware of the biodiversity crisis. So much so, that the RHS has stopped calling slugs and snails “pests”.Inquiries to the RHS about wildlife gardening increased by more than 28% in 2023. Bug hotels and water features continue to be growing trends, as does using less water overall, after the 2022 drought. There is more awareness of the devastating effects of harvesting peat for gardening, with gardeners experimenting with peat-free gardening and home composting.Plants traditionally seen as weeds such as cow parsley, daisies and dandelions are being celebrated for the boost they give to native pollinators, and people have been creating pretty borders with these wildflowers.Purple plants and planet-friendly gardening: the full RHS trends list for 2024
Greening grey spaces Creative ways to green up grey urban spaces has become a major new trend as city gardeners are growing successfully in pots, growing up instead of out and using innovative ways of colonising indoor space, including terrariums.
Grow your own The RHS gardening advice service and website continues to see growth in “grow your own”. The most popular plants are tomatoes, followed by cucumbers, courgettes, chillies and runner beans.
Purple power Purple vegetables have traditionally been difficult for the home gardener but now breeders have begun introducing purple varieties that are easier to grow than traditional ones and avoid previous drawbacks, such as non-fruiting and limited purple colour, especially after cooking. Gardeners and chefs can anticipate purple carrots, cauliflowers, broccoli, tomatoes, peas, radish, French beans and lettuces.
Climate change fruits Recent hot dry summers are ideal for certain fruits, grape vines being an outstanding example – but others include figs, almonds, apricots, melons, peaches/nectarines and watermelons.
Local seed provenances and survivalist gardens After the temporary hiccup to the vegetable supply chain last spring, some gardeners now favour growing with more independence, including where they source their seeds.
Going wild Plants traditionally seen as unwanted weeds such as herb robert and plantain are becoming popular. Cow parsley is now a desirable border plant and dandelions are recognised as being key to providing food for bees early in springtime.
Gardening with nature The move away from classical, formal layouts towards naturalistic landscapes will continue to grow, with gardens making people feel that they are in a wild place and providing benefits to wellbeing, wildlife and ease of maintenance.
Planet-friendly gardening Gardeners will be increasingly in tune with nature: inquiries to the RHS about wildlife gardening increased by more than 28% in 2023.
Houseplants reach the next level – Tropical-looking plants and orchids which create a “jungle vibe” have become popular, as has growing up instead of out. Favourites will include epipremnum, sedum morganianum, and old favourites such as string of hearts and spider plants.
 Succulents Driven by houseplants and sourcing drought-resistant bedding, interest in succulents is increasing, with commercial landscapers introducing the hardier ones into landscapes. New cultivars are also being released, including aeonium, cotyledon and crassula.

 La Niña has ended but there’s a 50-50 chance another will form by the Australian summer,"Bureau of Meteorology says winter will be wetter than average and a rare three-in-a-row La Niña is still on the cards

","['Ben Doherty', '@bendohertycorro']","The Australian Bureau of Meteorology has announced an end to the 2021-22 La Niña in the tropical Pacific – but it could return with the BoM changing its status to “watch”.La Niña, which involves warming ocean temperatures in the western Pacific, typically delivers increased rainfall across much of Australia along with cooler daytime temperatures south of the tropics and warmer night-time temperatures in the north.A senior US government scientist warned less than a fortnight ago that Australia’s east coast could be hit by a rare “triple La Niña” that would bring flooding rains and cooler weather for the third summer in a row in 2022-23.Sydney had its wettest summer for 30 years in 2021-22 and its wettest March on record. It’s already received more than 126% of its average annual rainfall this year. ‘Triple La Niña’: Australia may face another summer of flooding rains, US expert warnsRead moreWhile the previous La Niña is now officially over, the BoM’s “watch” categorisation means there is a 50% chance Australia will experience another La Niña event forming this year – double the normal likelihood. Winter is likely to be wetter than average.The BoM’s head of long-range forecasting, Dr Andrew Watkins, said a La Niña event three years in a row would be rare although not unprecedented.“While back-to-back La Niña’s are not uncommon, and in fact, we get them about half the time, since 1900, a three-year La Niña is less common,” he said. “We’ve only seen that three times since the middle of last century.”Watkins said meteorologists had been monitoring the weakening La Niña over several weeks.“A La Niña ‘watch’ does not change the outlook of above average rainfall for most of Australia over coming months,” he said.“The bureau’s long-range outlook remains wetter than average, consistent with model outlooks from other global forecast centres, reflecting a range of climate drivers including a developing negative Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and warmer-than-average waters around Australia.“Sea surface temperatures are currently warmer than average for much of the Australian coastline, particularly to the north and west. This pattern is likely to increase the chance of above average winter-spring rainfall for Australia.”

" Air pollution breaking WHO limits surrounds 25% of UK homes, analysis finds",Nearly 8m addresses affected by high levels of toxic particulates and nitrogen dioxide,['Clea Skopeliti'],"One in four UK homes are surrounded by air pollution exceeding safety limits set by the World Health Organization, an analysis has shown following research revealing that road pollution affects virtually every part of Britain.Nearly 8m UK addresses are affected by high levels of particulate matter or nitrogen dioxide, the data analysis commissioned by campaigning group the Central Office of Public Interest (COPI) showed.Researchers at Imperial College London used computer models to produce estimated concentrations of the levels of three toxic pollutants – PM (particulate matter) 2.5, PM10 and NO2 – at each address, accurate to 20 sq metres (24 sq yards).The results have been compiled into a searchable national database, where people can input an address to receive a rating of low, medium, significant, high or very high, with anything above “medium” meaning the address exceeds the limit for a pollutant.The analysis follows research revealing that 94% of land in Great Britain has some pollution above background levels, despite roads occupying less than 1% of the country. The University of Exeter study found that the most widespread pollutants are tiny particles, mostly from fossil fuel burning, nitrogen dioxide from diesel vehicles, and noise and light.More than 70% of the country is affected by all of these, with the only land to escape road pollution being almost entirely at high altitudes, affecting wildlife as well as seriously harming human health. Research indicates that air pollution at up to 500 metres (547 yards) from roads damages human health.COPI is pushing for estate agents and property websites to disclose pollution levels when advertising properties, having obtained a legal opinion from a QC stating that there is a “strong argument” that estate agents would be in breach of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 if they failed to inform customers about potential health risks.The COPI founder, Humphrey Milles, called for transparency around the risks of air pollution: “Air pollution affects everyone. It is a dangerous, invisible killer. With this national rollout, it would be shameful for the property industry to not start acting in an honest, transparent way. Lives depend on it. Everyone has a right to know what they’re breathing.”Jemima Hartshorn, the founder of the campaign group Mums for Lungs, described the statistics as “shocking”, but said the group was pleased the data was now publicly available.“We hope it will really help to raise awareness of the high levels of air pollution that are making so many of us sick. We really need to see urgent action on this and foremost we continue to call on the government to commit to reaching WHO levels, at the very latest by 2030 for all major pollutants across the UK,” Hartshorn said.Road pollution affects 94% of Great Britain, study findsRead more“We also need to see the government committing real funds to addressing this issue, and providing many more cities with progressive clean air zones. We need to finally address the issue of wood burning that has become the major contributor to particulate matter across the country.”The UK government is planning a £27bn expansion of England’s road network, but the Guardian reported in February that the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, had overridden official advice from civil servants to review the policy on environmental grounds. It has been a legal requirement to take into account the environmental impact of such projects since 2014.Dirty air is estimated to cause 40,000 early deaths a year in the UK.",2021-03-18
Beaver believers: Native Americans promote resurgence of 'nature's engineers',"The rodents are often considered ‘nuisance animals’, but they can play a vital role in maintaining healthy landscapes","['Supported by', 'About this content', 'Lucy Sherriff']","Molly Alves steps down hard on the edge of a heavy wire trap, forcing its sides open with her hands. With care she lays the poised trap, baited with twigs and branches, in a bracingly cold stream.  Her target? A beaver.Beavers are often considered “nuisance” animals on the US west coast and, if captured, are destroyed by animal control companies.But the beaver picked up by Alves is to be transported to Alves’ employers, the Tulalip Tribes, a nation in Washington’s western corner. This Native American community, and others, are at the vanguard of the “beaver believer” movement, which holds that the rodents can play an essential role in maintaining healthy landscapes.Beavers are known as nature’s engineers, due to their dam-building habits. For decades they have been hated by landowners, who dislike the animals’ tendency to fell trees and flood areas. However, their dams – although seen by some as a nuisance – help control the quantity and quality of water flow, while their ponds create habitat for numerous plants and animal species, including fish.'Piecing together a broken heart': Native Americans rebuild territories they lostRead moreThe Tulalip Tribes had to fight a lengthy legal battle in order to gain permission to relocate beavers on to their lands. Following a historic win, the tribes began bringing the animals back into their community in 2014.“It really was monumental,” says Alves, a biologist at the tribes’ wildlife agency who oversees the beaver program, which is renowned across the state.“Now we get calls from landowners who have heard about our project,” she explains. “They have beavers on their property, flooding roads, felling trees, and are frustrated because they don’t understand how to deal with the problem.Back in 2018, Washington’s Cowlitz Indian Tribe started on an ambitious project: to reintroduce beavers back into the Gifford Pinchot national forest, a wild region on the slopes of the Cascade mountains, as part of efforts to reclaim indigenous land management practices. The animals had not been in the region since the 1930s, after they were trapped into near-extinction in North America during the 1800s fur trade.In partnership with the Cascade Forest Conservancy, the tribe has spent the last two years capturing beavers from private lands, where their dams are often dynamited, and relocating them on to tribal land.The project has been such a success that the tribe was recently awarded a grant to survey beaver habitat, mapping the impact beavers have made on the land, in order to create a relocation model for other communities in the state – and perhaps further afield.View image in fullscreenBeavers caught from around the Seattle area stay at the Tulalip, Washington, fish hatchery as a sort of halfway house between capture and relocation. Photograph: Morgan Heim“Our culture and members depend upon a healthy ecosystem,” says Phil Harju, the chairman of the Cowlitz Indian Tribe. “Beaver are a key species that enable the ecosystem to function properly.”The successes in Washington have been keenly followed by tribal nations further down the coast.“Beavers are prominent in our village stories,” says Frankie Myers, the vice-chair of California’s Yurok Tribe. “He’s an architect, and they’ve gone through the same struggles against Europeans as us. The beavers were viewed as pests and driven off the land. We’re looking to bring the beaver back again, to help us manage the land like they used to.”Interest has been spurred by California’s most intense wildfire season on record – in 2020 the state experienced five of its six largest-ever fires. Research published last year revealed beavers can be used to mitigate the spread of fire because beaver-inhabited land is simply too wet to burn.But tribes in California have their own legal battle to wage: relocation of beavers in the state is illegal, and so communities have turned to other strategies, such as building beaver analogues – manmade dams – in order to attract the animals to their watersheds.“Doing a full beaver reintroduction is difficult, and so we just decided to build analogues to get them to come to us instead,” says Roger Boulby, the Yurok’s watershed restorationist, who is restoring the Klamath River by physically moving the river’s path, as well as trying to bring back beavers to help boost salmon populations.“The first beaver pond we built was five years ago and we saw their presence helped with the fish populations. And so last summer we built another analogue, and now we’ve put in a few of them. They’ve changed the landscape into this lush environment, which is great for the fish. This little creek is now this huge, deep body of water.”Until legislation changes in California, which classes beavers as a detrimental species, the tribe is limited to building suitable environments in the hopes of attracting beavers.“It’s unfortunate that the situation is so political but that is the case right now, given that the California department [of fish and wildlife] is reluctant to support beavers,” says Kate Lundquist, the director of the Occidental Arts and Ecology Center, a California organization that promotes biological and cultural diversity.Things are beginning to change, at least for one federally recognized tribe in California that for now does not wish to be named. This tribe has received the support of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to relocate beavers onto their reservation, working with the Occidental Arts and Ecology Center, the Tulalip Tribes and other partners.If this project goes well “it could open the door for future relocations,” says Lundquist. “We’re using these projects as pilots to show that beaver rewilding can be done in a responsible way, and hopefully that will answer some of the department’s concerns, and ideally make it available to those not on sovereign lands.”Sarah Beesley, the Yurok Tribe’s biologist, acknowledges that “there are huge stumbling blocks.” But “what’s really cool,” she continues, “is that Tribal Nations are breaking through these barriers.” This article was amended on 25 February 2020 to clarify the context of Kate Lindquist’s comments on new beaver introduction projects, which referred to California rather than Washington state.",2021-02-25
" Access to green space must be priority for land use in England, peers say",Cross-party report highlights need for greater access to natural world when deciding how to divide up land,"['Helena Horton', ' Environment reporter']","Access to green space needs to be prioritised when deciding how to use land, a report from the House of Lords has said.Peers from the cross-party House of Lords land use in England commission have laid out their priorities for a land use framework, which would divide up the land in England and decide where is best for different types of agriculture, as well as carbon sequestration, nature restoration and recreation.The report, published on Tuesday, explains that “a framework should help better identify and define those areas where land should be optimised for priority uses other than housing – for example, prime agricultural land for food production or land which is essential for carbon sequestration and nature recovery.”It highlights in particular the need for greater access to the natural world for the public, arguing that this is “important for health and wellbeing, especially in urban and peri-urban locations near where people live”. The report adds that “access to green space must be a priority in a land use framework, and provision and maintenance of accessible green space must also be strengthened in existing policies”.The report suggests using the green belt to expand access to green space. Matthew Kirby, a PhD researcher at Northumbria University, told the report that – when viewed through a natural capital lens – green belt areas have the potential to deliver significant multifunctional land uses, including carbon sequestration, flood management and recreation.The Green MP Caroline Lucas recently tabled a private member’s bill asking for the green belt to be open for the public, arguing it is near urban centres where many people do not have natural areas nearby.The report was also highly critical of the UK farming system. Jake Fiennes, the director of Holkham nature reserve in Norfolk, told the commission that “current agricultural and farming practices are generally unsustainable for the medium to long term. Our reliance on synthetic inputs and the effects they have on the wider environment are all too clear.”The report criticises the government for uncertainty around the post-Brexit farming payments, which were supposed to deliver nature recovery. Details around these have been delayed, with reports that the initially ambitious schemes are set to be weakened.Commenting on the report, Lord Cameron, the chair of the land use in England committee, said: “Land use in England is facing a growing number of conflicting pressures and demands including for food, nature, biodiversity, net zero targets, housing, energy and wellbeing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The US needs 1m more electricians to hit climate goals. Can it recruit more women?,"Women face barriers in the sector, including harassment and exclusionary unions, but they would help resolve a crucial labor shortage and could also help close the gender wage gap",['Danielle Renwick'],"As a child, Cora Saxton liked to make things – forts, whittled wood carvings, a flying saucer even – so when she became an electrician at 49, it felt like a perfect fit.“I like the puzzle-solving and being able to look back at the end of the day and see the physical result of your hard work,” she said.This made it easier to bear some of the indignities – “subtle challenges”, she called them – of working in an overwhelmingly male field. “Little stuff, like people walking by you to find the boss on the job” not realizing she was the boss, having tools and ladders taken out of her hands by pushy colleagues. “I call it ‘roostering’,” she said.Saxton, who now works at the California non-profit Grid Alternatives, thinks she had it pretty easy compared with other women in her field. She’s heard horror stories about threatening notes left in lockers, tools being stolen and destroyed – “even people getting their hard hats peed in”, she said.logoThe trades in general and electric work specifically are overwhelmingly male. Only 2% of electricians are women, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). It’s also a sector facing a massive labor shortage as the country looks to transition away from fossil fuels and toward electrifying cars and buildings.According to Rewiring America, an electrification non-profit, the United States will need 1 million more electricians to make updates such as installing solar panels, heat pumps and electric vehicle charging stations to help the country meet its climate goals.Those are a lot of job opportunities for something so badly needed. As author and journalist Bill McKibben put it in an interview with the New York Times: “If you know a young person who wants to do something that’s going to help the world and wants to make a good living at the same time, tell them to go become an electrician.”The gender wage gapGetting more women working as electricians would help resolve a crucial labor shortage, but it could also help close the gender wage gap. In 2021 the median annual pay for an electrician was just over $60,000, compared with about $45,000 for all occupations, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But some master electricians earn six-figure salaries.“There are 80,000 openings for electricians each year on average over the next decade just to replace workers who either retire or transition to different jobs,” said Sam Calisch, Rewiring America’s head of research. “That is all before the IRA” – the Inflation Reduction Act, Biden’s signature climate bill, which is expected to increase demand for electricians by creating incentives for Americans to electrify their homes and buy electric vehicles.Experts point to a lack of investment in technical schools and a culture that emphasizes four-year college degrees as the main path to a successful career as a few reasons there aren’t enough electricians to meet demand. “We don’t do a good job marketing ourselves as an industry in general, but particularly with women,” said Allie Perez, a plumber and founder of Texas Women in the Trades.View image in fullscreenElectrician apprentices at a trade school in Louisville, Kentucky, last year. Photograph: Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesPerez, who has an eight-year-old daughter, founded Texas Women in the Trades in 2013 because she was tired of being the only “young, brown woman” in most professional settings. She also wanted to help connect more young women like herself with well-paid jobs that they might not have envisioned for themselves. “We don’t share [enough] stories of women in the trades to show that they are also moms, daughters, friends and cousins and that they are able to support their families on this kind of work.”Barriers to more women in the industry include widespread harassment and abuse, lack of visibility, exclusionary unions, childcare and a lack of support for caregivers.“That relationship-based, white male network – hiring, retaining and training people, and keeping people on the core crew from project to project – is the culture at most construction companies,” said Connie Ashbrook, a retired construction worker and co-chair of the National Taskforce on Tradeswomen’s Issues. “If you’re not friends with the boss, or if you’re not friends with significant numbers of your co-workers, then you don’t get to hear about the jobs.”In 2009, Ashbrook was part of a successful effort to convince state officials to invest $2m in diversifying its highway construction workforce. Funds went toward pre-apprenticeship programs and supportive services, like childcare and accessible human resources contacts. Though gains in hiring more women were modest, a 2022 report on the initiative found it significantly improved retention rates.“This is the highest-paid blue-collar work you can get without a college degree,” Ashbrook said. “Not having access to these careers keeps women in poverty.”The childcare gap“Most childcare is set up to be very nine-to-five supportive,” said Kate Krug, executive vice-president of Nontraditional Employment for Women (New), an organization in New York that trains and places women, transgender and non-binary people in the skilled construction, utility and maintenance trades. “If you have to be out the door by 5am, you have to pay someone to sit with your kids until it’s time to go to school.”She said that’s why her organization offers students wraparound services. “That’s having a program manager who makes sure that you are ready for job interviews – you know, do you have childcare? Do you need childcare? Do you have a backup to your childcare? Do you have backup to the backup of your childcare?” she said.Tonya Hicks, who grew up in public housing in Mississippi, had to overcome discrimination on the basis of her gender and race – she is Black – in her quest to become an electrician. (Only about 7% of electricians are Black, according to BLS data.)“Women and minorities have been systematically kept out of the unions,” she said. “It began as racism, and then just as time goes on, you know, people hire who they know.”As an apprentice, Hicks was often relegated to cleaning the on-site office trailers. When she struggled to find work locally, she drove from her home in Meridian, Mississippi, to sites in Jackson and Birmingham, leaving her young son with her mother for stretches at a time.Her endurance paid off: in 2000, at age 28, she started her own firm, Power Solutions, in Atlanta. Today she has a staff of nine that specializes in renewable energy projects and home retrofits and, starting last year, began manufacturing electrical vehicle chargers. She also runs Women Do Everything, a networking group for women in the Stem field and blue-collar, male-dominated industries like hers.Grid Alternatives, where Saxton works, recruits female volunteers and trainees for solar installations and offers women-only trainings. “That may encourage people who would otherwise perhaps be intimidated or just scared to try it,” Saxton said. “At the same time, we need men to be mentors and to support women.’”View image in fullscreenConstruction workers at a project in Los Angeles, California, in 2021. Photograph: Bing Guan/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesThe Biden administration has expressed a commitment to getting more women into the trades; in November, plans were announced to double the number of women working in the construction industry over the next 10 years.The IRA climate legislation offers tax incentives for contractors to hire apprentices – something experts say could help reduce women’s higher dropout rates from apprenticeship programs. In February, the program office connected to the Chips and Science Act – legislation designed to boost the semiconductor industry in the US – released its first funding opportunity, which stipulates that all applicants hoping to receive more than $150m must submit a plan to provide access to childcare for workers.Hicks, the founder of Power Solutions, compared the task of transitioning the economy away from fossil fuels to the labor shortages during the second world war, when millions of women took jobs in factories. Of course, after the war, many women returned to their homes. “The only difference now is that we’re not going back,” she said.This article is co-published with Nexus Media News",2023-04-20
 California debates naming heatwaves to underscore deadly risk of extreme heat,Experts and advocates are also exploring new ranking systems to add urgency to the growing disaster of rapidly warming landscapes,"['Gabrielle Canon', '@GabrielleCanon']","Climate scientists from around the world issued dire warnings on Monday, in the latest IPCC report on the dangers posed in the unfolding climate crisis. Among them is extreme heat, a crisis that on average already claims more American lives than hurricanes and tornadoes combined.Though the impact is already being felt, heatwaves are largely silent killers. Often, the toll is tallied far into the aftermath of an event and is vastly undercounted. Unlike fires and floods that produce immediate and visible destruction, heat’s harmful effects can seem more subtle – even if they are in fact more deadly.“People don’t think of heat as a hazard,” says Kristie Ebi, a professor in the Center for Health and the Global Environment at the University of Washington. But in the Pacific north-west, where Ebi lives, for example, unprecedented temperatures baked the region last year, bewildering residents used to moderate, often lukewarm, summers.‘Loading the dice’: climate crisis could increase southern California wildfiresRead morePolicymakers and environmentalists are looking for better ways to close the gap in the public’s perception of the risks, especially in the American west where landscapes are rapidly warming.Some are pushing for new ranking systems to help elevate awareness around the issue or assign heatwaves names, much like federal agencies do for hurricanes.“We need a shock to the system,” said Kathy Baughman McLeod, the senior vice-president and director of the Adrienne Arsht Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center. The organization, which focuses on policy solutions to the climate crisis, has advocated heatwave naming along with number categories as a way to add urgency to the growing disasters.“If you go into the hospital now and are suffering from heat they will say you have kidney failure or heart failure” she says. “There are so many areas now we need to culturally shift that context of heat.”The group advised California on new legislation introduced last year, which would make it the first state to implement a naming and ranking system like the organizational system for categorizing storms dating back in the 1800s. Athens, Greece and Seville, Spain will roll out similar programs later this year.View image in fullscreenA sign at Zabriskie Point in Death Valley warns hikers of the risk of heat. Photograph: Bridget Bennet/ReutersAdvocates of the program believe assigning a name to a disaster will help people engage with it. “It becomes an identity and a brand is built,” Baughman McLeod said, adding that it also helps for archival purposes. “We all remember what happened during Hurricane Sandy. I know what a category 3 is and I know when it has a name it has reached a certain threshold and I need to pay attention and act.”Still, the science isn’t clear on whether a name would do much to communicate heightened dangers in the most effective way. “The National Weather Service is not aware of any research or evidence that suggests naming heatwaves would raise awareness about heat-related risks” said Kimberly McMahon, a NWS Public Weather Services program manager. But early warning systems, with or without associated names play an important part, she said. “Even knowing the potential for a heat event or abnormally hot summer can allow preparations to occur further in advance.”Naming aside, the two bills in California also outline the creation of an interagency heat taskforce, an extreme heat advisory council, and will open a new chief heat officer role to oversee planning and preparation. The pieces of legislation, if they pass, would initiate statewide advance warning and ranking by the start of 2024 and would establish the Extreme Heat and Community Resilience Program to coordinate state efforts and coordinate with local and regional officials.Ebi says that coordination between agencies – that include local, state and federal programs – will be key. “There are lots of opportunities to facilitate the information transfer so that as people develop these systems they don’t start from the very beginning” she said, noting that a variety of stakeholders should be brought to the table. “On the one hand the projections are dire,” Ebi says. “But on the other, we have an enormous basket of options for what can be done to protect people who are at higher risk during a heatwave.”Several municipalities across the west and governments across the globe are already adopting heat programs and plans. At the federal level, The National Integrated Heat Health Information Systems and White House Extreme Heat Interagency Working Group are collaborating to expand messaging about extreme heat and offering up lessons learned.Phoenix, which is at the top of the list of rapidly heating cities, hired scientist and heat expert David Hondula to head its new Office of Heat Response and Mitigation in September last year, becoming the first city to launch a publicly-funded position of this kind. Miami, Florida also brought on a chief heat officer, as did Athens, Greece and Freetown in Sierra Leone.There’s still a difficult path ahead, but according to Ebi, planning will go a long way.“All heat-related deaths are preventable,” she said. “We have a real opportunity to improve lives today even if the climate continues to change.”
This article was amended to remove reference to a study that found hurricanes with female names were more deadly than male-named hurricanes. The study, published in 2014, was subsequently challenged by the scientific community.

AnalysisShadow chancellor’s green investment deal strikes the right notesLarry Elliott Economics editor,Analysis: Rachel Reeves attempted to balance big spending plans with a commitment to value for money,,"While Rachel Reeves did not actually use the soundbite “prudence for a purpose” first coined by Gordon Brown, she might as well have done.The shadow chancellor’s speech to the Labour party conference in Brighton was all about balancing a series of seemingly contradictory ideas: how to convince voters that she can be trusted to run the economy, while at at the same time putting forward some striking new policies; how to keep the party faithful happy, while at the same time reassuring business.Every shadow chancellor in living memory has faced this challenge, and Reeves tackled it by delving into the New Labour playbook. Back in 1997, Brown sought to address the trust issue by granting the Bank of England the freedom to set interest rates. Reeves said she would create an office for value for money, with powers to ensure taxpayers’ cash is properly spent.She felt the need to provide this reassurance for two reasons. Firstly, voters clearly need some convincing about Labour’s approach to running the economy. Secondly, she also announced in her speech plans to spend £28bn a year for the rest of the decade to help Britain’s net zero transition. Although she didn’t actually use the words, this represents a Labour green new deal.The sums involved are considerable. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) expects capital spending to be just shy of £120bn in the current financial year, so Labour’s plans would involve a 25% increase.When he was shadow chancellor at the 2019 general election, John McDonnell said he would cover day-to-day government spending on items such as public sector pay through taxation, but was prepared to borrow for investment. Reeves would stick to that formula, with her plans for green investment resulting in higher government debt.The OBR’s recent fiscal risks report provides Reeves with some political cover for her approach. The spending watchdog said financing the net-zero transition would add 21% of gross domestic product to the national debt, but delaying action could double the cost.Reeves seemed to strike the right note with business groups, who also liked her pledge to scrap business rates and replace them with an alternative – as yet unspecified – form of taxation. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI’s chief economist, said the green investment sent the “right signal at the right time”.Some aspects of the plan require fleshing out. The money would be spent on everything from giga-factories that would supply batteries for electric vehicles to planting trees, and at some point Reeves will need to specify how much gets spent on all the items on her green agenda.Labour also seems to assume that all green investment is, by definition, good investment, but it is entirely possible that an independent office for value for money would say that billions of pounds are being squandered. Those are problems for another day, however.In the meantime, the fact that there was little immediate pushback from the Conservatives suggests Reeves has stolen a march on Rishi Sunak, who has plans for green investment of his own in next month’s spending review.",2021-09-27
 World’s largest vats for growing ‘no-kill’ meat to be built in US,"Commitment to building four-storey bioreactors is gamechanger for cultivated meat industry, says expert","['Damian Carrington', ' Environment editor', '@dpcarrington']","The building of the world’s largest bioreactors to produce cultivated meat has been announced, with the potential to supply tens of thousands of shops and restaurants. Experts said the move could be a “gamechanger” for the nascent industry.The US company Good Meat said the bioreactors would grow more than 13,000 tonnes of chicken and beef a year. It will use cells taken from cell banks or eggs, so the meat will not require the slaughter of any livestock.There are about 170 companies around the world working on cultured meat, but Good Meat is the only company to have gained regulatory approval to sell its product to the public. It began serving cultivated chicken in Singapore in December 2020.Cattle, chicken and other livestock have a huge environmental impact due to methane emissions, the destruction of forests and water use. The consumption of conventional meat in rich nations must fall dramatically to beat the climate crisis, scientists say. Proponents of cultivated meat say it can provide the same taste and feel as conventional meat but with a far smaller environmental impact.The creation of Good Meat’s 10 new bioreactors is under way, the company says, each of which has a capacity of 250,000 litres and will stand four storeys tall, far bigger than any constructed to date. The US site for the facility is due to be finalised within three months and operational in late 2024, reaching 11,800 tonnes a year by 2026 and 13,700 tonnes by 2030.The bioreactors are being manufactured as part of an agreement with ABEC, a leading bioprocess equipment manufacturer, which is also making a 6,000-litre bioreactor for Good Meat’s Singapore site – this is scheduled to begin production in early 2023 and will itself be the biggest cultured meat bioreactor installed to date.“I think our grandchildren are going to ask us about why we ate meat from slaughtered animals back in 2022,” said Josh Tetrick, the chief executive of Good Meat’s parent company, Eat Just.“Cultivated meat matters because it will enable us to eat meat without all the harm, without bulldozing forests, without the need to slaughter an animal, without the need to use antibiotics, without accelerating zoonotic diseases.“The bioreactors will be far and away the largest, not only in the cultivated meat industry, but in the biopharma industry too. So the design and engineering challenges are significant, the capital investments are significant and the potential to take another step toward shifting society away from slaughtered meat is significant.”One issue will be to ensure that the meat cells grow as well in large reactors as they do in the smaller ones used so far.World’s first lab-grown steak revealed – but the taste needs workRead moreCultivated meat has not yet been approved for sale by the US Food and Drug Administration. “We’ve submitted our application,” said Tetrick. “We’ve found the agency to be fully engaged, asking all the questions you’d expect, from cell identification to final product. We’d prefer not to try to predict if and when [approval] will occur.” Tetrick also said the company had produced a cell growth serum that does not require the use of bovine foetuses, which were previously widely used.Another cultivated meat company, Upside Foods, raised $400m in April, in part to fund a commercial-scale facility to produce thousands of tonnes of meat a year. It has not yet chosen the size of the bioreactors. “We honestly don’t even know what the limits are,” said Amy Chen, the chief operating officer at Upside Foods. “But we will make some final decisions around the size of the cultivators as it gets closer to the construction date.”The taste of the cultivated meat has been key in raising investment, Chen said. “Before I agreed to come on, I had to try the meat. I had that first bite and realised that it was simultaneously one of the most unremarkable things and one of the most remarkable things I’ve ever eaten. It’s just meat.”Other companies with facilities for cultivated meat include SuperMeat, Mosa Meat, Future Meat Technologies and the seafood producers Wildtype and Shiok Meats. There are also many companies making plant-based meat replacements.Caroline Bushnell, a vice-president at the non-profit Good Food Institute, said: “The scale of [Good Meat’s] facility represents real and growing confidence from companies in the commercial potential of cultivated meat. This plant, with its potential to decrease production costs, could be a gamechanger in the race to bring meat grown from cells to restaurants, supermarkets and dining tables.”.Rosie Wardle, a partner and co-founder at Synthesis Capital, said: “This announcement is another example of the cultivated meat industry reaching an inflection point and moving from ‘proof of concept’ to commercial scale. As investors, we are excited about the potential for this part of the alternative protein industry to play an important role in the future of food.” Synthesis Capital announced a $300m fund on Wednesday to invest in alternative proteins and food technology, the largest dedicated fund raised in the sector to date.Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BSTMost of the meat people eat in 2040 will not come from slaughtered animals, according to a 2019 report from the consultancy Kearney that predicts 60% will be either grown in vats or replaced with plant-based alternatives.",2022-05-26
The 10 biggest science stories of 2022 – chosen by scientists,"From moon missions to fast-charging batteries and AI-sourced antibiotics, in no particular order, the year’s significant scientific developments",[],"1. The Dart and Orion missionsThe year opened with a bang. Or rather, it didn’t. The successful film Don’t Look Up, in which a comet is found to be on a collision course with Earth, had been released just before Christmas 2021. In the bleak days of post-festive gloom, the news media were on an adrenaline high, chasing any and every story about potential asteroid collisions to cheer us all up. Five asteroids were to pass close to the Earth in January alone! Happily for the health and wellbeing of humanity, none was predicted to come within a whisker of hitting the planet. Nonetheless, the possibility of an asteroid colliding with Earth is a reality – the globe is covered in craters from previous impacts, and it is well known that 65m years ago, dinosaurs became extinct following the impact of an asteroid about 10km across. Can anything be done about saving us from this existential extraterrestrial threat? Fortunately, the international space community has taken the first steps towards reducing the risk of an asteroid catching us unawares. The joint Nasa- Esa mission Dart (Double Asteroid Re-Direction Test) was an ambitious attempt to alter the trajectory of a small asteroid (Dimorphos) as it orbited a slightly larger asteroid (Didymos), by sending a spacecraft to crash into it. In October, we learned that the mission had been even more successful than anticipated, and that the orbit of Dimorphos had changed – showing that we could, if given sufficient time, alter the path of an asteroid if it were on a collision course with Earth.As well as asteroid activity, our moon has been in the news, as a destination of choice for a new generation of astronauts. This year, it is 50 years since the Apollo 17 mission, the last time a human set foot on the moon. So it is a cause for celebration that Artemis, another joint Nasa-Esa programme, has started its operation to return people to the moon. The first phase of the mission, the Orion capsule, was launched in mid-November, and successfully returned to Earth last week. The capsule is designed to hold up to six astronauts – though there were none on board this maiden flight around the moon. We can now look forward to a series of increasingly complex flights of Orion – culminating in a crew of astronauts landing on the moon as soon as 2025.Monica GradyMonica Grady is professor of planetary and space sciences at Open University2. Covid’s boost to immune researchA man gets his Covid booster in Nice, October this year. The coronavirus has spurred huge advances in the fields of vaccine development and administration. Photograph: Syspeo/Sipa/Rex/ShutterstockVaccine technology has seen an unprecedented acceleration in innovation that could soon be benefiting us in a host of ways. A vaccine works by delivering an “infection” signal (something from the germ) and an “alert” signal (to wake the immune response up). As our knowledge of immunology has increased, so too has our capacity to innovate in the vaccines that deliver those signals. Designing any new vaccine takes a long time, significant investment and a lot of eager volunteers, all of which was accelerated during the pandemic, resulting in a host of novel developments.The autumn Covid-19 booster shots we have just been offered are one such example – these bivalent vaccines target the original strain of Sars-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid-19) alongside the Omicron variant. Bivalent vaccines have advantages over the original vaccines as they both top up and broaden our immunity. But what if you could broaden your immunity further – to not just two but multiple strains of virus? So-called multivalent vaccines for Covid-19 and flu are looking very promising. Another approach we could soon see is the use of sniffable or inhalable vaccines – mucosal vaccines. These are already used in China to tackle Covid-19 and may offer long-term protection against respiratory viruses. They are also much more appealing for those of us who are needle-phobic. If these new developments deliver on their promise, then one day soon the calls for annual shots could be a thing of the past.

AI reveals new antibioticsAntibiotic susceptibility testing in the lab. This year for the first time, several groups have reported using AI to create novel antibiotic drugs. Photograph: jarun011/Getty/iStockphotoOver the course of the past few years, AI has transformed the field of molecular biology. The revolution started with the AlphaFold algorithm, which rapidly predicts the complex three-dimensional structures of proteins, thus aiding the understanding of protein functions and the identification of drug targets. This year, AI has achieved another breakthrough, this time at the other end of the drug discovery pipeline: several groups in 2022 have reported the first successful applications of AI to identify novel antibiotic drugs.Antimicrobial resistance is a major global threat. This year, the global research on antimicrobial resistance report published in the Lancet indicated that, worldwide, 4.95m deaths were associated with drug-resistant bacteria in 2019, making untreatable infections one of the leading causes of death.Developing new drugs that overcome resistance and replenish our arsenal of effective antimicrobials is a continuous struggle. And that is where AI is now beginning to make a major contribution. For example, Yue Ma and colleagues from the Chinese Academy of Sciences used machine-learning techniques originally developed for natural language processing to identify antimicrobial peptides encoded by the genome sequences of microbes in the human gut. The algorithm identified 2,349 potential antimicrobial peptide sequences. Of these, 216 peptides were synthesised by chemical methods, and 181 of them were shown to have antimicrobial activity. This is an impressive success rate, which would not have been possible without the aid of AI.Even more strikingly, almost half of the peptides discovered were entirely new, without obvious sequence similarity to known antimicrobials, thus increasing the chances of circumventing existing resistance mechanisms. Animal experiments showed that three of the new peptides could be used for the safe and effective treatment of bacterial pneumonia in mice. Studies such as this are good news, promising an unprecedented rapid route towards novel treatment options for some of the scariest pathogenic threats we currently face.

Early weather warningsDisplaced people carry belongings along a flooded road in Jaffarabad, south-eastern Pakistan, in August this year. Photograph: Zahid Hussain/APIn 2022, science was able to see a hurricane hitting the coast of the US before it even formed out at sea. We could visualise the Brisbane River spreading out into Australian homes before a drop of rain had fallen. And we put firefighters on action stations before the spark was lit that burned southern France. We now have the technology to see many of these natural hazards coming, days in advance.And yet 2022 has been full of lethal events. In Europe, more than 20,000 people died from record-breaking heat this summer, hitting more than 40C (104F) across England for the first time. In August, one third of Pakistan was underwater during a monster monsoon season, killing 1,700 people. Global heating is making these types of disasters worse.This is why the key scientific story from the past year is not cutting-edge research or hi-tech engineering, but the push by the UN secretary general António Guterres for the world to have equal access to early warnings. Alerting people to danger, so they can take action, is the best way to prevent tragedy. We need equal access to skills and systems that were pioneered years ago. Critical, too, is the leadership to share information and act on the warnings that ensue. Hannah ClokeHannah Cloke is professor of hydrology at Reading University5. Inclusive inroadsA scanning electron microscope image of red blood cells affected by sickle cell disease. A new treatment for the condition may soon be available. Photograph: Science History Images/AlamyThis year saw a small but important advance in the treatment of sickle cell disease, a group of inherited disorders that cause red blood cells to become sickle shaped and can lead to anaemia. A drug developed to treat an enzyme deficiency (pyruvate kinase) was found to improve anaemia and reduced acute episodes of severe pain in sickle cell disease. While the research is still in its early phases, the researchers point out that their breakthrough came from looking at the characteristics of people with sickle cell disease rather than focusing only on their red blood cells. This development has been found to benefit people with other conditions and brings hope to millions of people worldwide, but predominantly in Africa, the Indian subcontinent and South America.This was also the year when Nasa’s Artemis mission, which aims “to land the first woman and first person of colour on the moon” by 2025, put female torsos Helga and Zohar into space to test the effects of radiation on the grounds that women appear to be at a greater risk from space radiation than men. This may seem unremarkable, but it was only in 2022 that a Swedish research team designed a new crash test dummy representing an “average woman”, rather than a scaled-down version of the male dummy that is the size of a 12-year-old girl.Developments such as these excite hope of inclusive science where gender, ethnicity and location neither privilege nor exclude.

Photograph: Vesa Moilanen/Lehtikuva/AFP/Getty6. Elite mathematiciansThe Fields medal recognises outstanding mathematical achievement for existing work. Often described as the Nobel prize of mathematics, it is awarded every four years to recipients under the age of 40.Congratulation to Prof James Maynard, who was awarded a Fields medal this year for his “spectacular contributions” to analytic number theory, “which have led to major advances in the understanding of the structure of prime numbers and in Diophantine approximation”.One of his standout proofs was to prove the following: there are infinitely many prime numbers whose decimal representation does not contain the digit 7.Such a simple statement to understand but not very easy to prove. Maynard joins an elite list of British mathematicians who have won the medal.Congratulations also to one of the other Fields medallists, the Ukrainian mathematician Maryna Viazovska, the second woman to win the award. The mathematician Henry Cohn stated: “Viazovska manages to do things that are completely non-obvious that lots of people tried and failed to do.” She was cited for many mathematical accomplishments, in particular her proof that an arrangement called the E8 lattice is the densest packing of spheres in eight dimensions.

Soft cell, hard cell…When we think about what influences how the cells inside our bodies develop, we often think of biological or chemical factors. But physical forces – what’s known as the “mechanical” environment – can be just as critical to a cell’s journey. The ability of cells to sense and respond to their mechanical environment has been known for several decades: for example, stem cells grown on soft jelly-like gels will become different cell types compared with stem cells grown on stiff glass-like surfaces.Brillouin microscopy is non-damaging, allowing you to ‘see’ the stiffness of cells without touching them Early signs of diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer’s are often associated with changes in cell stiffness. However, it has been difficult to measure the stiffness of cells and organs inside our bodies, and how they change during development and disease. Tools to measure cell mechanical properties have relied on applying forces to the cell – essentially poking or cutting a cell and seeing how it responds. This is often invasive and damaging, and isn’t easily performed on living cells or organs inside animals, let alone humans.This year, two research groups, one from Germany, and one from the US, published separate studies demonstrating groundbreaking improvements in a method to measure cell-stiffness, known as Brillouin microscopy. This optical method is non-damaging, allowing you to “see” the stiffness of a material without having to touch it. Developments in this technique this year have significantly advanced imaging speed and resolution, and reduced photo-damage, making the method now widely applicable for observing changes in cell mechanical properties in living animals.This method will provide a powerful tool for early diagnosis of diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis and Alzheimer’s. It will also revolutionise how scientists can measure and track the mechanical changes of our cells during normal development, and critically improve our understanding of the importance of mechanical forces in biology.

He was honoured for his work on quantum entanglement, along with fellow pioneers Alain Aspect and Anton Zeilinger. Photograph: Jonas Ekströmer/TT/Rex/Shutterstock“Spooky action at a distance.” That’s what Albert Einstein called quantum entanglement, which is when two quantum particles have to be considered as a single entity, since influencing one of them affects the other even when they are far apart.In October this year, the three pioneers of quantum information science, Alain Aspect of the University of Paris-Saclay, John Clauser of JF Clauser & Associates, and Anton Zeilinger of the University of Vienna were awarded the Nobel prize in physics for their contributions to understanding quantum entanglement.There are many reasons to enjoy this long overdue award. For the sheer beauty of providing new insights into an exciting area of fundamental phenomena. For laying the groundwork for breakthroughs in quantum computers to carry out complex calculations that would be impossible on a conventional computer, and in quantum encryption that could allow secure communications. For spurring more experiments to address one of the great questions of science – how to reconcile quantum mechanics with Einstein’s general theory of relativity.And finally, for demonstrating another example of the importance of curiosity-driven basic science leading to real-world applications that could change the way we live and work.

Nature positiveGreenpeace activists hold up banners at Cop15, the UN biodiversity conference, in Montreal, Canada, earlier this month. Photograph: Canadian Press/Rex/ShutterstockA huge moment for biodiversity is still ongoing as I write: the much-delayed 15th meeting of the parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in Montreal, which will set a course for nature recovery from now until 2050. These international agreements feed into national legislation, such as the UK’s Environment Act. Alongside this, companies are making bold commitments to become “nature positive”, meaning that their activities should, overall, lead to nature being in a better state.Nature-positive commitments need to translate into real, measurable – and attributable – recovery of nature. This is very challenging, though, partly because many products have tortuous supply chains so that the companies themselves don’t always know what the biodiversity impact of their activities is. For example, nickel is a crucial component of our daily lives, being used in the production of stainless steel. Yet how often do we stop and think about where the nickel in our cutlery or electric car batteries has come from, and how producing it has affected the environment?One impact is the clearance of forests in areas where nickel ore is mined. Ambatovy nickel mine, the biggest mine in Madagascar, is one of a growing number of businesses to have made a commitment to leave nature in no worse a state as a result of its operations. The mine compensated for its forest clearance by putting measures in place to stop clearance of forest by local people for agriculture elsewhere. This year, Katie Devenish and colleagues at Bangor University published a paper looking at whether they had succeeded. Using sophisticated methods to separate out the effects of the mine’s activities from other factors leading to forest loss, the researchers demonstrated that the mine was on track to prevent at least as much deforestation as it had caused. The study is a model for how scientists can carry out thorough and independent evaluations of companies’ environmental commitments, reducing the temptation to greenwash.We need many more studies like this, that link the esoteric world of high-level policy-making to realities on the ground, in all sectors from mining, to food, to transport and infrastructure. Then we will have a much better chance to hold our governments and companies to account, and reverse the loss of nature, wherever it takes place.

This year researchers have made progress in building sodium-based batteries, which could reduce the need for destructive mining methods. Photograph: David McNew/GettyIt’s one of the greatest unappreciated stories of our time: the incredibly rapid improvements in battery technology that will form the foundation of an electrified world as we wean ourselves off fossil fuels.Of course there are questions. What about the costs? Will batteries ever really store enough energy for their size to power something like a large plane? And where will we get all the rare metals necessary to build them?That’s why my story of the year is the October Nature paper by Chao-Yang Wang and co-authors, describing a way to charge energy-dense batteries incredibly quickly – in just a few minutes. It really highlights the phenomenal speed at which battery chemists, engineers and technologists are rising to the challenge. If you can charge a car battery in 10-12 minutes, charging more frequently becomes much less of a problem, allowing for smaller batteries that are cheaper and less resource-intensive to make.We are also seeing huge progress in battery technologies based on cheap, abundant sodium instead of expensive and relatively rare lithium, as well as methods to make all these batteries far easier to recycle.The basic principles of a battery haven’t changed, but the potential of the newest versions is astonishing and getting better all the time.

,A flood of new research is overturning old assumptions about what animal minds are and aren’t capable of – and changing how we think about our own species ,,"Giraffes will eat courgettes if they have to, but they really prefer carrots. A team of researchers from Spain and Germany recently took advantage of this preference to investigate whether the animals are capable of statistical reasoning. In the experiment, a giraffe was shown two transparent containers holding a mixture of carrot and courgette slices. One container held mostly carrots, the other mostly courgettes. A researcher then took one slice from each container and offered them to the giraffe with closed hands, so it couldn’t see which vegetable had been selected.In repeated trials, the four test giraffes reliably chose the hand that had reached into the container with more carrots, showing they understood that the more carrots were in the container, the more likely it was that a carrot had been picked. Monkeys have passed similar tests, and human babies can do it at 12 months old. But giraffes’ brains are much smaller than primates’ relative to body size, so it was notable to see how well they grasped the concept.Can humans ever understand how animals think? – podcastRead moreSuch discoveries are becoming less surprising every year, however, as a flood of new research overturns longstanding assumptions about what animal minds are and aren’t capable of. A recent wave of popular books on animal cognition argue that skills long assumed to be humanity’s prerogative, from planning for the future to a sense of fairness, actually exist throughout the animal kingdom – and not just in primates or other mammals, but in birds, octopuses and beyond. In 2018, for instance, a team at the University of Buenos Aires found evidence that zebra finches, whose brains weigh half a gram, have dreams. Monitors attached to the birds’ throats found that when they were asleep, their muscles sometimes moved in exactly the same pattern as when they were singing out loud; in other words, they seemed to be dreaming about singing.In the 21st century, findings such as these are helping to drive a major shift in the way human beings think about animals – and about ourselves. Humanity has traditionally justified its supremacy over all other animals – the fact that we breed them and keep them in cages, rather than vice versa – by our intellectual superiority. According to Aristotle, humans are distinguished from other living things because only we possess a rational soul. We know our species as Homo sapiens, “wise man”.Yet at a time when humanity’s self-image is largely shaped by fears of environmental devastation and nuclear war, combined with memories of historical atrocity, it is no longer so easy to say, with Hamlet, that man is “the paragon of animals” – the ideal that other creatures would imitate, if only they could. Nature may be “red in tooth and claw”, but creatures whose weapons are teeth and claws can only kill each other one at a time. Only humans commit atrocities such as war, genocide and slavery – and what allows us to conceive and carry out such crimes is the very power of reason that we boast about.In his 2022 book If Nietzsche Were a Narwhal, Justin Gregg, a specialist in dolphin communication, takes this mistrust of human reason to an extreme. The book’s title encapsulates Gregg’s argument: if Friedrich Nietzsche had been born a narwhal instead of a German philosopher, he would have been much better off, and given his intellectual influence on fascism, so would the world. By extension, the same is true of our whole species. “The planet does not love us as much as we love our intellect,” Gregg writes. “We have generated more death and destruction for life on this planet than any other animal, past and present. Our many intellectual accomplishments are currently on track to produce our own extinction.”If human minds are incapable of solving the problems they create, then perhaps our salvation lies in encountering very different types of minds. The global popularity of the documentary My Octopus Teacher, released by Netflix in 2020, is just one example of the growing hunger for such encounters. In the film, the South African diver Craig Foster spends months filming a female octopus in an underwater kelp forest, observing most of her lifecycle. Foster presents himself as the anti-Jacques Cousteau; he doesn’t go underwater to study the non-human, but to learn from it.Humility is a traditional religious discipline, and there is a spiritual dimension to Foster’s quest and to the film’s success. On YouTube, where the trailer has been viewed 3.7m times, thousands of people testify that My Octopus Teacher made them weep, changed their understanding of the world and made them resolve to lead better lives. It’s clear that, for modern people who seldom encounter animals except for pet cats and dogs, entering into a close relationship with a non-human mind can be a sacred experience.The idea of the octopus as the nonhuman mind par excellence was popularised by the 2016 bestseller Other Minds: The Octopus, the Sea, and the Deep Origins of Consciousness, by Peter Godfrey-Smith. A philosopher rather than a marine biologist, Godfrey-Smith got an opportunity to see the creatures in action at a site off eastern Australia known to researchers as Octopolis. There he discovered that octopuses are “smart in the sense of being curious and flexible; they are adventurous, opportunistic”, prone to making off with items such as tape measures and measuring stakes.A horse, pictured competing in the World Equestrian Games in France. Photograph: Régis Duvignau/ReutersThe fascination of the octopus is that while its behaviour seems recognisable in human terms as mischief or curiosity, its neural architecture is immensely different from ours. Since Darwin, humans have grown used to recognising ourselves in our fellow primates, whose brains and body plans are similar to our own. After all, humans and chimpanzees share a common ape ancestor that lived in Africa as recently as 6m years ago. Our most recent common ancestor with the octopus, by contrast, is a worm-like creature thought to have lived 500-600m years ago.Because the mind of the octopus evolved in a completely different fashion from ours, it makes sense of the world in ways we can barely imagine. An octopus has 500m neurons, about as many as a dog, but most of these neurons are located not in the brain but in its eight arms, each of which can move, smell and perhaps even remember on its own. In Godfrey-Smith’s words, an octopus is “probably the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien”. When such a being encounters a human at the bottom of the ocean, what could it possibly make of us?For most of the 20th century, animal researchers wouldn’t even have asked such a question, much less attempted to answer it. Under the influence of the American psychologist BF Skinner, scientific orthodoxy held that it was neither legitimate nor necessary to talk about what was going on in an animal’s mind. Science, he argued, only deals with things that can be observed and measured, and we can’t directly observe mental faculties even in ourselves, much less in animals. What we can observe is action and behaviour, and Skinner was able to modify the behaviour of rats using positive reinforcement, such as rewards of food, and negative reinforcement, such as electric shocks.When Jane Goodall first went to study chimpanzees in Tanzania in the 1960s, the very notion of animal subjectivity was taboo. Her practice of giving names to the individual chimps she observed – such as David Greybeard, who her studies made famous – was frowned on as unscientific, since it suggested that they might be humanlike in other ways. The standard practice was to number them. “You cannot share your life with a dog or a cat,” Goodall later observed, “and not know perfectly well that animals have personalities and minds and feelings. You know it and I think every single one of those scientists knew it, too, but because they couldn’t prove it, they didn’t talk about it.”Today, the pendulum has swung in the other direction. Scientists speak without embarrassment about animal minds and consciousness. In popular writing on the subject, Skinner appears only as a villain. In his 2016 book Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are?, primatologist Frans de Waal discusses a mid-20th-century experiment in which researchers at a primate centre in Florida, educated in Skinner’s methods, tried to train chimps the way he had trained rats, by withholding food. “Expressing no interest in cognition – the existence of which they didn’t even acknowledge,” De Waal writes, the researchers “investigated reinforcement schedules and the punitive effect of time-outs.” The staff of the primate centre rebelled and started feeding the chimps in secret, causing Skinner to lament that “tender-hearted colleagues frustrated efforts to reduce chimpanzees to a satisfactory state of deprivation”. You could hardly ask for a better example of how the arrogance of reason leads to cruelty.Meanwhile, animals without “rational souls” are capable of demonstrating admirable qualities such as patience and self-restraint. Among humans, the ability to sacrifice immediate pleasure for future gain is called resisting temptation, and is taken as a sign of maturity. But De Waal shows that even birds are capable of it. In one experiment, an African grey parrot named Griffin was taught that if he resisted the urge to eat a serving of cereal, he would be rewarded after an unpredictable interval with food he liked better, such as cashew nuts. The bird was able to hold out 90% of the time, devising ways to distract himself by talking, preening his feathers, or simply throwing the cup of cereal across the room. Such behaviours, De Waal notes, are quite similar to what human children do in the face of temptation.More intriguing than the convergences between human and animal behaviour, however, are the profound differences in the way we perceive and experience the world. The reason why an encounter with an octopus can be awe-inspiring is that two species endowed with different senses and brains inhabit the same planet but very different realities.Closeup of African elephant. Photograph: Gaertner/AlamyTake the sense of smell. As humans, we learn about our surroundings primarily by seeing and hearing, while our ability to detect odours is fairly undeveloped. For many animals, the reverse is true. In his 2022 book An Immense World, the science journalist Ed Yong writes about an experiment by researcher Lucy Bates involving African elephants. Bates found that if she took urine from an elephant in the rear of a herd and spread it on the ground in front of the herd, the elephants reacted with bewilderment and curiosity, knowing that the individual’s distinctive odour was coming from the wrong place. For them, a smell out of place was as fundamental a violation of reality as a ghostly apparition would be for us.Animals that perceive the world through scent, such as dogs, even have a different sense of time. We often talk about the importance of “living in the moment”, but in fact we have no other choice; since visual information reaches us at the speed of light, what we see around us are things as they existed an infinitesimal fraction of a second ago. When a dog smells, however, “he is not merely assessing the present but also reading the past and divining the future”, Yong writes. Odour molecules from a person or another dog can linger in a room long after the source is gone, or waft ahead before it appears. When a dog perks up long before its owner walks through the front door, smell can seem like a psychic power.If giraffes can do statistical reasoning and parrots understand the concept of the future, then where does the distinctiveness of the human mind really lie? One favourite candidate is what psychologists call “theory of mind” – the ability to infer that each person is their own “I”, with independent experiences and private mental states. In The Book of Minds, the science writer Philip Ball describes the classic experiment that tests the development of this ability in children. A child and an adult watch as an object is hidden under one of three cups. Then the adult leaves the room and the child sees a second adult come in and move the object so it’s under a different cup.When the first adult returns, where does the child expect she will look for the object? Very young children assume that she will know its new location, just as they do. Starting around age four, however, children start to understand that the adult only knows what she has seen herself, so they expect her to look under the original, now empty cup. “Indeed,” Ball writes, “they will often delight in the deception: in their knowing what others don’t.”Developing a theory of mind is necessary because we can never know what is going on inside other people in the same immediate way we know ourselves. Most adults take for granted that other people have the same kind of inner life they do, but this remains a kind of assumption. René Descartes was one of the first philosophers to wrestle with this problem, in the 17th century. “What do I see from the window but hats and coats which may cover automatic machines?” he asked. “Yet I judge these to be men.” But Descartes didn’t extend the same benefit of the doubt to animals. Even more than Skinner, he saw them as automata without any inner experience, “bêtes-machines”. Ball notes that Descartes dissected live animals to study the circulation of the blood, “and dismissed any cries of pain that procedure elicited as a mere mechanical response, not unlike the screech of a poorly oiled axle”.A common octopus. Photograph: Reinhard Dirscherl/Getty ImagesFour centuries later, De Waal complains that science still hasn’t overcome the tendency to draw a dividing line between the inner lives of humans and those of other creatures. The reason that scientists have focused on theory of mind, De Waal believes, is because no animal has been shown to possess it. Such “interspecific bragging contests”, he writes, are designed to flatter our sense of superiority. In fact, it seems that even here we’re not clear winners. According to Ball, recent attempts to replicate the theory-of-mind experiment with chimps and bonobos suggest that the majority of them pass the test, though the evidence is ambiguous: since the subjects can’t talk, researchers gauge their expectations by tracking their eye movements.Even if other species were conclusively found to possess a theory of mind, of course, it would not challenge our monopoly on the kind of “rational soul” that produced the pyramids and monotheism, the theory of evolution and the intercontinental ballistic missile. As long as these quintessentially human accomplishments remain our standard for intellectual capacity, our place at the top of the mental ladder is assured.But are we right to think of intelligence as a ladder in the first place? Maybe we should think, instead, in terms of what Ball calls “the space of possible minds” – the countless potential ways of understanding the world, some of which we may not even be able to imagine. In mapping this space, which could theoretically include computer and extraterrestrial minds as well as animal ones, “we are currently no better placed than the pre-Copernican astronomers who installed the Earth at the centre of the cosmos and arranged everything else in relation to it”, Ball observes. Until we know more about what kinds of minds are possible, it is sheer hubris to set up our own as the standard of excellence.Xenophanes, a pre-Socratic philosopher, observed that if horses and oxen could draw pictures, they would make the gods look like horses and oxen. Similarly, if non-human beings could devise a test of intelligence, they might rank species according to, say, their ability to find their way home from a distance unaided. Bees do this by detecting magnetic fields, and dogs by following odours, while most modern humans would be helpless without a map or a GPS. “Earth is bursting with animal species that have hit on solutions for how to live a good life in ways that put the human species to shame,” Gregg says.But if human and animal minds are so essentially different that we can never truly understand one another, then a troubling thought arises: we would be less like neighbours than inmates who occupy separate cells in the same prison. The kind of understanding Foster achieved with his octopus, or Goodall with her chimpanzees, would have to be written off as an anthropomorphising illusion, just as Skinner warned.The possibility of true interspecies understanding is the subject of Thomas Nagel’s landmark 1974 essay What Is It Like to Be a Bat?, to which every writer on animal cognition pays their respects, sometimes wearily. Nagel, an American philosopher, concluded that humans can never really understand a bat’s inner experience. Even if I try to picture what it’s like to fly on webbed wings and spend most of my time hanging upside down, all I can imagine is what it would be like for me to be a bat, not what it’s like for a bat to be a bat.For Nagel, this conclusion has implications beyond animal psychology. It proves that mental life can never be reduced to things we can observe from the outside, whether that means the way we behave or the pattern of electrical impulses in our neurons. Subjectivity, what it feels like to exist, is so profoundly different from what we can observe scientifically that the two realms can’t even be described in the same language.An emu at Taronga zoo, Sydney. Photograph: Jenny Evans/Getty ImagesFew people have ever taken the challenge of Nagel’s essay as literally as Charles Foster in his 2016 book Being a Beast. A barrister and academic by profession, Foster set himself the challenge of entering the mental worlds of five animal species by living as much like them as possible. To be a fox, he writes: “I lay in a back yard in Bow, foodless and drinkless, urinating and defecating where I was, waiting for the night and treating as hostile the humans in the row houses all around.” To be a badger, he dug a trench in the side of a hill and lived inside it with his young son Tom, eating earthworms and inhaling dust. “Tom was filling tissues with silica and blood for a week,” Foster notes.Foster welcomes all this damage and discomfort, but not in the spirit of a scientist doing fieldwork. Rather, he evokes the medieval flagellants who covered their backs with welts to purge themselves of sin. That Foster defines sin as a transgression against nature rather than God doesn’t make the concept any less religious. “Evolutionary biology is a numinous statement of the interconnectedness of things,” he writes, and his preaching translates easily into Christian terms: “Say, with Saint Francis, ‘Hello, Brother Ox,’ and mean it,” he demands.Foster’s way of seeking communion with the animals may be extreme, at times comically so, but his basic impulse is shared by many of today’s students of animal cognition, and an increasing number of laypeople as well. Encountering an animal mind can perform the same function as a great work of art or a religious experience: it makes the familiar strange, reminding us that reality encompasses far more than we ordinarily think.The great difference is that while a traditional religious experience can awaken human beings to God, an animal epiphany can awakens us to the fullness of this world. “What she taught me was to feel that you’re part of this place, not a visitor,” Foster says in the closing lines of My Octopus Teacher, and by “this place” he doesn’t just mean a particular kelp forest, but the Earth itself. At first this might sound like an odd realisation: where else would human beings belong if not on our one and only planet?But in the 21st century, it is clearly becoming harder for us to think of ourselves as genuinely belonging to the Earth. Whether we look back on our long history of driving other species to extinction, or forward to a future in which we extinguish ourselves through climate breakdown, many humans now see humanity as the greatest danger facing the Earth – a cancer that grows without limit, killing its host.It is no coincidence that, at the same moment, tech visionaries have begun to think about our future in extraterrestrial terms. Earth may be where humanity happened to evolve, they say, but our destiny calls us to other worlds. Elon Musk founded SpaceX in 2002 with the explicit goal of hastening humanity’s colonisation of Mars. Other “transhumanist” thinkers look forward to a fully virtual future, in which our minds leave our bodies behind and achieve immortality in the form of electromagnetic pulses.These projects sound futuristic, but they are best understood as new expressions of a very old human anxiety. We have always suffered from metaphysical claustrophobia – the sense that a cosmos containing no minds but our own was intolerably narrow. That is why, since prehistoric times, humans have populated Earth with other kinds of intelligences – from gods and angels to fairies, forest-spirits and demons. All premodern cultures took the existence of such non-human minds for granted. In medieval Europe, Christian and Greek philosophical ideas gave rise to the doctrine of the “great chain of being”, which held that the universe is populated by an unbroken series of creatures, all the way from plants at the bottom to God at the apex. Humanity stood in the middle, more intelligent than the animals but less than the angels, who came in many species, with different powers and purviews.Love you to death: how we hurt the animals we cherishRead moreFilling the universe with hypothetical minds, superior to our own in wisdom and goodness, helps relieve our species’ loneliness, giving us beings we could talk to, think about, and strive to emulate. Our need for that kind of company in the universe hasn’t gone away, though today we prefer to fill the region “above” us in the space of possible minds with advanced extraterrestrials and superpowered AIs – beings that are just as hypothetical as seraphim and cherubim, at least so far.Our rising interest in animal minds can be seen as a way of filling in the regions “below” us as well. If an octopus is like an intelligent alien, as Godfrey-Smith writes, then we don’t need to scan the skies so anxiously for an actual extraterrestrial. Yong quotes Elizabeth Jakob, an American spider expert, to the same effect: “We don’t have to look to aliens from other planets … We have animals that have a completely different interpretation of what the world is right next to us.” Perhaps simply knowing that these other minds exist can help us make peace with the limitations of our own.

 Queensland police refuse to remove traditional owners occupying Adani’s coalmine site,Miner says group is ‘trespassing’ but police have acknowledged their cultural rights under human rights act,"['Ben Smee', '@BenSmee']","Queensland police have told a group of First Nations people occupying the site of Adani’s Carmichael coalmine for the past five weeks that they have no intention of removing them from the area “at this time”.The group of Wangan and Jagalingou traditional owners opposed to the coalmine project began an ongoing cultural ceremony within the boundary of Adani’s mining lease in late August.Adani says the group are “anti-fossil fuel activists” who are “trespassing under the guise of traditional activity”.Police say in a statement their investigations and negotiations are “ongoing”. But officers at the mine site have told the group of traditional owners that they recognise their cultural rights to conduct ceremony, under provisions of the 2019 Queensland Human Rights Act.Buried Queensland government report found Adani plan to protect black-throated finch was ‘superficial’Read moreThe situation potentially paves the way for an ongoing standoff at the mine – where the Queensland government has extinguished native title – between Adani and Indigenous protesters.“We understand that your connection to culture is disappearing and you don’t want to lose that,” a police officer says in an audio recording shared with Guardian Australia.“At the moment you guys are here and you’re practising culture, and part of that under the Human Rights Act is for that to be practised and shared.“We have no intention at this time is to come in [and remove you], our intention is to support you through that [and] mediate the two groups.“Initially we were here [because Adani] were making a complaint against you guys being here, at this time that is not the case. Please note we are not the enforcers here. If they want to do something they’ve got their legal avenues they need to take.”In a formal statement, police said they were still investigating Adani’s complaint.“A police command team, including police negotiators and police liaison officers have been in negotiations with all stakeholders involved,” the statement said.“This includes people at the camp, mining employees and executives from government departments with a view to obtain a peaceful and non-disruptive resolution into the future.”Earlier this year, the Queensland police service issued a “statement of regret” to W&J man Adrian Burragubba, who complained to the Queensland Human Rights Commission about his removal from a pastoral lease area near the mine site.It’s phenomenal that they actually understand the rights that we are assertingCoedie McAvoyCoedie McAvoy, a Wangan and Jagalingou man and the son of Burragubba, said the group was “practising our culture and performing traditional ceremony on our home lands, the place of our ancestors”.“The police came in with the understanding that we are practising our human rights. They accepted that we have human rights pursuant to section 28 of the Queensland Human Rights Act and they quoted that section knowing that we are asserting that right. It’s phenomenal that they actually understand the rights that we are asserting.“This has been a long time coming in the history of my family, going back to the separation and removal from country.“For [police] to come back now as representatives of the Queensland government, and accept that we are asserting our right to practise our culture is a great feeling for us.”“We are the first Aboriginal people to use the Human Rights Act to defend our cultural rights and we are going to keep doing it.”Drop in aquifer levels near Adani mine sparks concern for sacred wetlandsRead moreThe miner has a formal land-use agreement with the W&J people. That agreement is opposed by some traditional owners.Earlier this year, the rating agency Moody’s cited ongoing Indigenous opposition to the Adani project while warning miners their credit ratings could be downgraded if they did not maintain good relationships with traditional owners.“While in this case [Adani] was ultimately given exclusive possession to the land and granted approvals for its mine, the inability to maintain social licence to operate with some members of the local Indigenous community adds another layer of risk to a project that was already facing challenges in maintaining social licence to operate with the broader community because of environment concerns,” the Moodys report said.“This may also add further complexity to a project where some participants from the investment community have signalled an unwillingness to provide funding.”Adani said the group at the mine site were “anti-fossil fuel activists” who were unlawfully trespassing.“The complaints are now with Queensland Police Service to appropriately deal with,” the miner said.“We are supportive of our traditional owners undertaking cultural practices and ceremonies on their traditional lands and as a responsible landholder we will continue to ensure that when people do wish to access our land properties, they are able to do so in a planned, safe, and respectful manner“However, we won’t tolerate criminal activity on our mining lease, nor anti-fossil fuel activist group Frontline Action on Coal cloaking their anti-coal protest camp and trespassing under the guise of traditional activity.”",2021-10-03
 UK should ‘mobilise army of volunteers’ to transform energy landscape,Campaigners say community energy groups can help reduce country’s dependence on Russian fossil fuel,"['Helena Horton', ' Environment reporter']","The UK should “mobilise an army of volunteers” to transform the country’s energy landscape and reduce its dependence on Russian fossil fuel by setting up community energy groups, say campaigners.With energy prices rising, local schemes such as solar panels, locally-funded wind farms and even hydroelectric dams could be crucial to helping generate energy.John Taylor, the energy projects manager at Energy Hub, argues that the UK should be convening local groups that can help give advice on grants for insulation and heat pumps, set up community-owned renewable projects, and help with insulation.“Volunteers can be provided with thermal imaging cameras to go door to door,” he suggested. They can help “identify cold spots and installing simple measures like draft proofing and radiator panels. They can also help set heating controls and lower boiler flow temperatures.”He also suggests that community groups can “run a village survey to find out who needs items like DIY loft insulation and draft proofing kits. Then order them wholesale to get bulk discounts and deliver them to a community centre or village hall for people to collect.”Taylor told the Guardian: “When it comes to the climate emergency and the current gas crisis, people don’t just want to be spectators, they want to be involved in the solutions. Next winter is shaping up to be an unprecedented challenge, so it’s vital we insulate and fit renewables to as many homes as possible over the next nine months.”Local authorities and energy hubs have access to government grants for such schemes.Taylor added: “Mobilising an army of volunteers to help find homes who most need help would have an immediate and positive impact; community energy groups can bring that really important element of trust for referring vulnerable people to these official grant programmes.”Unlike other energy businesses, these community schemes are owned by the people who live near the infrastructure, and can profit from the energy provided.“When it comes to larger projects like solar and wind farms, it’s important to remember that community energy groups are businesses like other developers, but they’re democratically owned by the people who will live alongside this new infrastructure,” Taylor explained.“The revenues from power sales stay with those communities and can be reinvested in other services they really need like rural electric buses fuel poverty alleviation, and upgrading schools and community buildings. During the Covid lockdown, Ferry Farm Community Solar in West Sussex donated £40,000 to local food banks.”Infrastructure communities have a stake in could be a more palatable way to reach the onshore renewables targets required to reach net zero by 2050. This is because those who live nearby can profit from them and have a say in how and where they are built.“If communities are empowered to be proactive in designing and developing their own schemes, whether on their own or in partnership with commercial developers, not only will we see a greater acceptance for these schemes, we will see a multiplier/levelling up effect as millions in community benefit funds start flowing into grassroots projects all across the country,” Taylor said.One group of people in Oxford has managed to harness their local river to provide enough hydroelectric energy to power 55 homes a year.However, critics of the government’s policy including the Conservative MP Philip Dunne, who chairs the environmental audit committee, have said the current schemes are not sufficient.This is because energy generated has to be sold back to the grid, rather than used directly to power the nearest homes, which makes the idea less attractive to communities and results in waste.Examples of good community energy projectsSouth-east - Enborne Parish Field Solar Farm – a small solar farm on charity-owned land. Original purpose of the charity was to use land to grow firewood to distribute to the poor of the village. Now giving it a modern twist by using sunlight to make electricity instead of firewood.Midlands – Cromford Mill Hydropower – Nottingham city council is working with local people to install a water wheel on the River Derwent, which could power homes with hydroelectric energy. There was a water wheel on this site in 1776, so new technology is meeting historic infrastructure.North-west – Lancaster Cohousing – this nonprofit housing group has homes connected to a community microgrid.

Covid tests and superbugs: why the deep sea is key to fighting pandemics,"As scientists explore how life in the abyss could generate new medicines, deep-sea mining is threatening to wipe it out
More in this series Race to the bottom: the disastrous blindfolded rush to mine the deep sea ‘False choice’ – is deep sea mining required for an electric vehicle revolution?","['Seascape: the state of our oceans is supported by', 'About this content', 'Helen Scales']","It has been 30 years since the last new class of antibiotic was introduced to the market. All the existing drugs are essentially variations on a theme: they kill bacteria, in similar ways. Some burst cells walls, others block DNA replication.But the bacteria are swiftly evolving to survive those chemical attacks – and as they survive, they become virulent superbugs. Without new antibiotics, by 2050 the death toll from drug-resistant infections is projected to reach 10 million people a year, making the coronavirus pandemic seem almost quaint.This is why scientists at Plymouth University have been searching the cold, dark abyss of the north Atlantic – where they have found sponges that contain powerful molecules capable of killing those superbugs.A seabed garden on the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean. Chemical defences made by microbes living inside corals and sponges have been likened to the human gut microbiome. Photograph: Xinhua/AlamyKerry Howell, professor of deep-sea ecology, and her colleagues have been carefully collecting specimens of these plant-like animals, bringing them back to the lab and testing pulverised extracts against stubborn, disease-causing bacteria. Among the deep-sea molecules, they are finding promising bactericidal novelties.“We don’t actually know exactly what they are yet,” says Prof Mat Upton, a microbiologist who leads the laboratory side of the biodiscovery programme at Plymouth. “We’ve got compounds that kill bacteria that we want to try to kill, and we have a pretty good idea that they are new compounds. It is early, but things are progressing through the pipeline.”Q&AWhat is deep sea mining? ShowDeep-sea mining involves retrieving mineral deposits from the area of the ocean below 200 metres down to the sea bed, which is the largest and least explored environment on Earth, occupying 65% of the planet’s surface. Mining firms say that metals found there, such as copper, nickel, aluminium, lithium, cobalt and manganese, are needed to make batteries, smartphones and solar panels. When will it happen?So far, 31 exploration licences have been granted by the International Seabed Authority (ISA), a UN body, and 1.5m sq km has been set aside, equivalent to an area the size of Mongolia, in the Pacific and Indian Oceans as well as along the mid-Atlantic ridge. The decision by Nauru to trigger a rule forcing the ISA to approve a Mining Code – a set of rules “to regulate prospecting, exploration and exploitation of marine minerals in the international seabed area” – will likely lead to full exploitation contracts in less than two years.Why is it a problem?Mining could do huge damage to the deep sea and the creatures and ecosystems that exist there. Underwater ecosystems such as volcanic mountains, hydrothermal vents and deep-sea trenches are still poorly understood. Many endemic deep-sea species could be wiped out by the creation of a single large mine, and many other creatures will be affected by noise, light pollution and plumes of mining sediment. What can be done? An immediate moratorium on deep-sea mining must be instituted while scientists assess the potential damage to biodiversity, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Fundamentally, the IUCN also says people need to recycle and reuse products so there is less demand for extraction of natural resources. New types of batteries are also being designed that do not require metals from the sea bed. Chris Michael and Phoebe WestonWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The hit rate for finding powerful and useful new compounds is proving to be especially high among animals of the deep sea. Hundreds of biologically active compounds have been found at the bottom of the ocean, some already in widespread use. Enzymes found in bacteria living around hydrothermal vents are even being used in tests for the Covid virus.Yet novel antibiotics and an untold variety of beneficial molecules could easily be wiped out if ecosystems around vents and elsewhere on the ocean floor were to be destroyed by deep-sea mining, which could go ahead in less than two years. Even after 40 years of scientific research since hydrothermal vents were first found, a tremendous amount is still being discovered about these extreme ecosystems, which thrive in scorching, toxic waters pouring through cracks in the deep seabed, miles underwater.There can be up to 1,000 different species of bacteria in one spongeProf Rosemary DorringtonHowell says: “Part of the big concern that all deep-sea ecologists have is that we know just how little is known about these areas and we are desperately trying to play catch-up with the [deep-sea mining] industry. To my mind, that’s the wrong way round. We ought to be finding out about these places before we even consider mining them.”One of the potential targets for deep-sea mining is the south-east Atlantic abyss, where Howell is planning her next expedition, along with South African colleagues. “It’s one of the least-explored parts of our planet. There’s really very little data,” she says .They aim to visit a vast underwater mountain range, the Walvis Ridge, which stretches almost 2,000 miles between the island of Tristan da Cunha and Namibia. Deep-sea miners are eyeing up seamounts such as these for their outer crusts, which are rich in metals, including cobalt.Map of Pacific Ocean’s Clarion Clipperton zone, which has vast mineral depositsHowell’s team also plans to study the south Atlantic’s abyssal plain, which is dotted with metallic rocky nodules similar to those in the central Pacific’s Clarion Clipperton zone, now attracting feverish interest among deep-sea miners.“We’re trying to find out more about these areas, the species that live there and also what else they do for humans, one aspect of which is their potential biomedical value,” says Howell.Their voyage, which was first delayed by the coronavirus pandemic, then cancelled due to the funder UKRI’s government-imposed budget cuts, was part of a five-year research programme, One Ocean Hub, that is seeking ways to share various benefits of the oceans equitably, encompassing environmental, socioeconomic and cultural values.One aim of the collaboration between dozens of organisations worldwide is to juxtapose the oceans’ easily monetised values, such as seabed mining, with the less tangible benefits, such as carbon sequestration and the hidden stash of potential new medicines.Natural capital economists will run models to predict how the deep sea’s wildlife, mineral riches and hidden benefits interact, and how using one could put others at risk.The ecosystem around one hydrothermal vent. These fissures releasing geothermally heated water are easily destroyed by mining, making the animals living around them particularly vulnerable. Photograph: Science History Images/Alamy“What we’re interested in doing is making society aware of those trade-offs and those competing uses,” says Howell. “We obviously get a lot of benefits from the ocean that we don’t necessarily appreciate.”Studies have found that up to three-quarters of deep-sea sponges and corals contain potentially useful compounds. These animals can look like trees, flowers or shrubs, and sometimes like balls of cheese on sticks. “They can’t run away and they need to find ways of protecting themselves – and often it’s chemical,” says Rosemary Dorrington, professor of microbiology at Rhodes University in Grahamstown, South Africa, and a research partner at One Ocean Hub.Many of these chemical defences are made by communities of microbes living inside the corals and sponges, which Dorrington likens to the human gut microbiome. “There can be up to 1,000 different species of bacteria in one sponge,” she says.Deep-sea submersibles developed for the oil industry are used to pluck specimens from the seabed.

Robotic submersibles developed for the offshore oil and gas industry have become the remote eyes and hands for scientists working in the deep. And only a single specimen of each species is needed. “In the old days, you’d need kilograms of something to extract milligrams of a compound. Now we can detect those compounds in parts per million,” Dorrington says.In contrast to the search for medicines – where only a single specimen needs to be plucked from the seabed, using deep-diving submersibles originally developed for the oil industry – the likely footprint of deep-sea mining operations will be immense. Mining robots would be dispatched to scrape the tops off enormous seamounts, to gather nodules over hundreds of square miles and to demolish hydrothermal vent chimneys.Snails with armoured scales have been found near hydrothermal vents.

Two out of only three known populations live on vent fields in the Indian Ocean that have been allocated mineral exploration permits, allowing mining corporations to prospect and conduct testing.Besides destroying habitats and species, Dorrington worries that mining operations, working on far vaster scale than scientific research, could contaminate fragile, living communities – including microbes – that have taken millions of years to evolve.“It would be exactly the same as if we went to Mars,” she says. “We would need to be considering what we’re taking with us.”

,"Viewed by the Chumash people as their ancestral home, the Native American tribe is behind the first Indigenous-led initiative to protect the ocean and repair its damaged ecosystem","['Seascape: the state of our oceans is supported by', 'About this content']","The Chumash people viewed the Pacific Ocean as their first home. Their territory once spanned 7,000 sq miles, from the rolling hills of Paso Robles to the white sand beaches of Malibu. Now, the region is one of the most expensive in the US, home to resort hotels, vineyards and multimillion-dollar mansions.The average house price in Avila Beach, California, where Violet Sage Walker grew up hunting for grunion in the midnight hours, is $1.9m (£1.5m).“My father would walk across the creek on the backs of steelhead and salmon,” says Walker, the Chumash tribal chair. “They were that abundant. Now the water’s contaminated, from sewage, runoff and overpopulation. In one generation we’ve lost the ability to feed ourselves off the land.”Violet Sage Walker, the Chumash tribal chair. Photograph: Gina CinardoAs stewards of that land, however, the Chumash remain an active presence. Today, Walker, her long black skirt rippling in the breeze, is conducting a ceremony for a local surf club that helps veterans connect with the ocean. Along with three other Chumash elders, she blesses a circle of veterans – all standing on their surfboards – with ceremonial sage, and sings an ancestral song used to call to whales.Blue whales, along with southern sea otters, black abalone, snowy plovers and leatherback sea turtles, are just some of the species at risk here. The California coast is experiencing climate breakdown at twice the rate of other parts of the ocean, and acidification, caused by pollution, is the main threat to marine life.Indeed, new development has plagued the area with pollution: pipeline spills dumping thousands of gallons of crude oil into the ocean; leaks from old petrol tanks seeping into groundwater; urban stormwater and agricultural runoffs polluting the streams. The threat of offshore oil drilling looms in the near future.That’s why Walker’s father, Fred Collins, the chief of the Northern Chumash Tribal Council, spent decades advocating to turn 156 miles of coastline here in central California into a national marine sanctuary, which would grant it federal protection. Not only would marine life, from sea otters to kelp forests, be preserved, but the proposed sanctuary would safeguard Chumash traditions.Two days before he died unexpectedly in 2021, he passed to his daughter the legacy of realising his dream.The average house price in Avila Beach is $1.9m. Photograph: Wirestock, Inc./Alamy“He told me it was the most important thing he’d ever worked on in his life,” Walker says, as she walks through the early morning ocean fog on Avila Beach. “The sanctuary is a reflection of who we are, our people, and this land.”If successful, it would be the first tribally nominated, tribally led sanctuary on the US mainland. The proposed site will be a co-management initiative between the Chumash, other local tribal groups and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(Noaa). Noaa manages 14 national marine sanctuaries – as well as the Papahānaumokuākea and Rose Atoll marine national monuments – but this would be the first in partnership with an Indigenous group.The sanctuary would stretch from near the coastal village of Cambria, halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles, to just south of Santa Barbara County, encompassing 7,670 sq miles of ocean.The sanctuary is a reflection of who we are, our people, and this landViolet Sage Walker“It’s big – it’ll be six times the size of Yosemite,” says Stephen Palumbi, a professor of marine sciences at Stanford University’s Hopkins Marine Station. “The question is – how do you monitor that big an area? How do you understand the dynamics, and relate climate change to what is going to happen in the future?”Palumbi has been working with Walker using technology called environmental DNA, which identifies organisms from minute flecks of cellular material, to survey the proposed area. Monitoring will be key to understanding the impact of offshore development on marine life.The proposed Chumash national marine sanctuary“Sanctuaries aren’t national parks,” says Palumbi. “They have a limited role in managing something like fishing. But they do three major things: they’re a great nexus for combining interests by different parties – such as fishing, local landowners, and state fish and wildlife departments. They’re also a structure within the federal government, which means they have access to budget and research resources. And they can take local knowledge and graft it with administration abilities, which is a powerful combination.”Most pressingly, a sanctuary would help safeguard the region against major industrial development, such as oil drilling, a battle that has dragged on for decades. Sanctuaries prohibit the discharging of waste material, altering the seabed, disturbing cultural resources and, crucially, developing oil, gas or mineral mining.Sea lions on San Miguel Island, California.

Noaa’s Office of National Marine Sanctuaries is reviewing all public feedback and drafting a management plan to be released as early as this month. Fifteen senators and members of Congress have written a letter urging the designation of the sanctuary, which could happen in early 2024.“It’s got a very good chance of being approved,” says Palumbi. “All the elements are there.”When land is conserved, native people are also eliminated from it … There’s a strong movement to reverse that changeProf Stephen PalumbiAs well as recognising Chumash history, the sanctuary would mark out the area as an internationally significant “ecological transition zone”, where temperatures from the cold north meet the subtropics, creating unique conditions for marine life. It would allow the Chumash to work with scientists to monitor marine life, helping create a new framework for collaboration between western science and traditional ecological knowledge.The Chumash are looking to Mai Ka Pō Mai – a Hawaiian initiative that brings together federal agencies and Indigenous people to manage the land in the north-western Hawaiian islands – for inspiration. For centuries, US government agencies have been at odds with Indigenous stewardship, and although there have been some efforts at co-managing tribally sacred land, for example Bears Ears National Monument in Utah, this sanctuary is the first to be nominated by a tribal entity.“When land is conserved, native people are also eliminated from it,” Palumbi says. “That’s happened in pretty much every national park. There’s a strong movement to reverse that change but the damage has already been done.”Barcelona’s beaches could vanish as authorities abandon ‘enhancement’Read moreTribal elder Mati Waiya from the Chumash Nation conducting the dedication ceremony for Surfrider Beach in Malibu as it became the first World Surfing Reserve in 2010. Photograph: Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty ImagesThe way Walker sees it, the Chumash have been stewards of the land for 15,000 years. “We welcome every culture on Chumash land,” she says. “My dad wanted people to know the Chumash like you know Hawaiians. Just as many people go to Hawaii as come here, and they don’t know about the Chumash. He wanted the sanctuary to be a way to share our stories, our culture, the beauty of our people and the magic of our homeland.” This article was amended on 23 May 2023. An earlier version suggested that a collaboration such as that envisaged by the Chumash initiative “has yet to translate to the US mainland”. That omitted to note there have been some efforts at co-managing tribally sacred land with US government agencies, for example Bears Ears National Monument in Utah.",2023-05-23
 Seabirds nest in new spots on Farne Islands as Covid keeps people away,"National Trust rangers are keen to see how the return of tourists will affect the birds’ new habits

Coronavirus – latest updates

",['Helen Pidd'],"It is not just humans who have changed their habits as a result of the pandemic. On the Farne Islands in north-east England, seabirds have used Covid as an opportunity to try out new nesting spots while rangers and tourists stayed away.While the absence of people has been a boon for some species, it has made life harder for others.View image in fullscreenArctic terns have been attracted to new spots on the islands while visitors and rangers are absent. Photograph: Katielee Arrowsmith/National TrustRangers suspect that Arctic terns have moved to new islands partly because National Trust staff who would normally ward off seabird predators have been unable to do so due to lockdown restrictions.Covid has meant a skeleton team has carried out core conservation work on the islands, which has seen predators such as black-headed gulls become more prevalent in some areas.The islands, off the coast of Northumberland, reopened to visitors on 21 June after an 18-month closure.The Farne Islands are home to around 100,000 pairs of nesting seabirds, including three species of tern, eiders, shags, puffins, razorbills, gulls and guillemots.Rangers are keen to see how the return of tourists will affect the birds’ new habits.“One of the fascinating consequences of not having visitors to the islands over the last year and a half has been the effect it appears to have had on wildlife,” said Harriet Reid, a Farne Islands National Trust ranger.“While Arctic tern numbers seem to have reduced on the Inner Farnes, they have likely taken the opportunity to nest on the outer islands, including the National Trust’s colony at Beadnell Bay, other islands such as Brownsman and Staple, Lindisfarne and RSPB Coquet.“We think this is the first time this has ever happened and could be a result of several factors including gulls changing their behaviour and the locations they frequent in response to the lack of people.”The puffin and seabird count has taken place on the Farne Islands for more than 50 years but was only carried out in a limited format last year due to the pandemic.This year’s puffin count is under way and early signs show they have had another good year, despite some low-lying burrows being flooded by the recent heavy rainfall.Outcry over plans for Sussex holiday village next to rare bird habitatRead more“While the recent poor weather has destroyed some of the puffin burrows on lower parts of some islands, anecdotally it would appear as though puffins have had another positive breeding season, with many pufflings being hatched in recent weeks,” said Reid.While the results of the annual species monitoring will not be known for some months, it appears that fulmars, kittiwakes, guillemots and shags have also fared well over the last year.“What will be really interesting to see is the effect that the return of visitors has on seabird behaviour. It may be that we see the new sites occupied by Arctic terns again next year, coupled with their return to Inner Farne.”",2020-08-19
 This article is more than 3 months oldGreenpeace warns over safety of Zaporizhzhia nuclear plantThis article is more than 3 months old,"International regulators unable to properly monitor Russian-held site, says dossier sent to western leaders","['Dan Sabbagh', ' Defence and security editor']","International regulators are incapable of properly monitoring safety at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, according to a critical dossier compiled by Greenpeace that is being sent to western governments on Thursday.The environmental campaign group concludes the International Atomic Energy Agency has too few inspectors at Europe’s biggest nuclear plant – four – and that there are too many restrictions placed on their access.It argues that the IAEA is “unable to meet its mandate requirements” but it is not prepared to admit as much in public, and as a result what it describes as Russian violations of safety principles are not being called out.Shaun Burnie and Jan Vande Putte, nuclear specialists at Greenpeace, conclude: “The IAEA risks normalising what remains a dangerous nuclear crisis, unprecedented in the history of nuclear power, while exaggerating its actual influence on events on the ground.”The vast Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, with six reactors on site, was captured by Russia in early March 2022 and has been on the frontline of the war ever since. It is sited on the Dnipro River in central Ukraine and Ukrainian forces occupy the riverbank opposite, leaving the plant in the sights of both sides’ militaries.Russian forces have based themselves inside the plant, potentially numbering 500-600 based on reports from early in the war. Imagery from 2022 revealed some armoured vehicles present. At times it has come under attack, including in August 2022 when shelling blew holes in the roof of a storage unit.The IAEA declined to comment directly on the Greenpeace report but highlighted that it had had inspectors on site since September 2022, and that without their presence “the world would have no independent source of information about Europe’s largest nuclear power plant”.All six of its reactors are in shutdown, and concerns about whether there was enough water available for cooling after the dam at Nova Kakhovka downstream was breached in June have been eased by the drilling of new wells, according to the IAEA.But anxieties remain about the potential for a fresh outbreak of fighting at the plant, as Ukraine seeks to regain territory in its counteroffensive.Greenpeace’s conclusions are supplemented by an open-source military assessment, written by McKenzie Intelligence. Most of the Russian troops and defences on the site are likely to be concealed, and inspectors report evidence that some areas of the plant have been mined, though it is unclear how heavily.But relying on satellite imagery, the analysts said there was evidence that the occupiers had built sangar firing points on the roof of four of the reactor halls. Track marks, also revealed from above, demonstrate that Russia routinely fires Grad or Smerch rocket launchers at Ukrainian targets from various sites between 1km and 18km away from the plant.The Russian military is also likely “to be using the proximity of the nuclear power plant as a shield” to deter counter-battery fire, Burnie and Vande Putte write, a breach, they argue, of the IAEA’s five safety principles first announced by its director general, Rafael Grossi, at the UN security council in May.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Russian managers requested inspectors give one week’s notice of all access requests, it added.Such statements, Greenpeace said, demonstrated that the IAEA could not confirm compliance because of “Russian obstruction” – and accused the global nuclear inspectorate, which has 177 member countries including Russia and Ukraine, of “taking its commitment to neutrality too far”.Copies of the Greenpeace dossier were submitted on Wednesday night, before publication, to a number of the IAEA’s international board of governors. They include representatives of the US, UK, France and Germany. It is understood Greenpeace has also held discussions with Ukraine about the situation at the plant.",2023-09-28
Experience: a baby seal broke into our home,"It made its way into the spare room and on to a couch. ‘Oi, no!’ I said",['Jenn Ross'],"We moved to Mount Maunganui, a small seaside community in New Zealand’s beautiful Bay of Plenty, 10 years ago for my husband Phil’s work as a marine biologist. I had seen seals around Pilot Bay, which is near here. Sometimes you see them out on the rocks, sunning themselves or playing – but usually in their own territory.It was a dark winter morning in August this year when the seal came. At 5.50am, I left the house to go fitness training. I went down to the car parked in the driveway and heard a growl. I thought our ballsy cat, Coco, must have chased a dog under the car.I jumped into the car to avoid getting my ankles nipped, and moved slowly, but then I felt the car rub against something. When I got out to have a look, I couldn’t see anything and thought it must have moved on. Then when I got back into my seat, I saw a baby seal in the headlights.I thought, “Oh my God,” but didn’t panic – the ocean is just down the driveway and I thought it would find its way back. Off I went to training and gave everyone there a laugh when I said, “Sorry I’m late, there was a seal under the car.”I didn’t think about it again until I got home. As I walked through the garage, I noticed our buckets had been moved. I wondered if it was the seal, but dismissed it because I didn’t think it could fit through the cat flap, which was the only way into the garage. But I was wrong. As I opened the door to the house, I brushed something and heard this flip-flip-flip-flip sound, and thought, “My God, that is the seal.”The seal at the foot of the stairs.It was so cute, like an adorable soft toy with big dewy eyes. Part of me wanted to keep it, but seals smell bad. I was conscious it was a wild animal, and while it was cute, I didn’t want to find out how sharp those teeth were.It looked at me. I retreated and went to check on the children. They were asleep. I phoned Phil, who was on his way home from a work trip, thinking he was not going to believe what was happening.The seal was in the house for another half hour or so. I was sitting near the bottom of the stairs, and could hear it grunting and puffing. I put my head into our spare room to find it had made its way in there, and up on to the couch. It was trying to get on to the standing desk. I said, “Oi, no!” It turned and looked at me, and settled down, which was very civilised.We called a ranger from the Department of Conservation, and someone came to pick up the seal. It is sad to see a wild creature wrapped up in a net, but I was comforted after the ranger said it would be released in a sheltered spot away from dogs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Inside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Then an hour later, she appeared on the neighbour’s fence meowing, probably retelling this whole big story about the seal. She refused to go downstairs for a few days.I hadn’t thought of sharing the story, but the next day we thought we should help the department raise awareness about seals in the area. We posted the photos on social media and it snowballed. It was pretty amusing to have people around the world see it.We did about 15 to 20 interviews over a week, and there were a lot of emails from journalists in Portugal, Germany, Switzerland, Malaysia and Thailand. It felt nice to be a light news story, because there was some pretty grim news in between. I could understand why people were so ready to have a laugh.It was quite a weird experience to have all that attention for a week, but we have commemorated it. It was Phil’s birthday in September and I had an obvious gift for him: a T-shirt with the logo “A seal visited my house, and all I got was this T-shirt”.There are still some people in our community who don’t know about the seal. My son’s hockey teacher came to babysit and I said, “Oh you can see where the seal was.” She just looked confused. It is quite funny – a story can reach right around the world but someone down the road doesn’t know what the hell we are talking about. As told to Eva CorlettDo you have an experience to share?

An anxious American west sizes up historic climate bill: ‘We need every tool’,"While the legislation provides renewed hope, work remains to be done to ensure the funding is put to best possible use","['Gabrielle Canon', '@GabrielleCanon']","The passage of the historic US climate legislation this weekend sparked renewed hope in environmental circles and even tears of joy in Congress. Many who have spent decades on the front lines feel that, despite its imperfections, the landmark federal funding opens up new frontiers on which to fight in a rapidly changing world.Record Death Valley flooding ‘a once-in-1,000-year event’Read moreThe call to arms rings especially true in the American west, where the devastating effects of the climate crisis – from drought to wildfires to heatwaves – are already hitting home.And there’s little time to waste. While the bill may be able to stave off some of the worsening effects of global heating, it will take more to combat the catastrophes already unfolding.“We have no more time on the climate crisis,” said Mary Creasman, CEO for EnviroVoters, an organization rooted in California that advocates and organizes for climate initiatives and environmental justice. Expressing “immense excitement”, about the bill, Creasman said it was encouraging to see that the federal government can still achieve big things.But work remains, and that means ensuring the funding lands where it can be best put to use. And while enthusiasm abounds, there are also concerns that agencies that will receive a boost may be ill-equipped to turn dollars into impact.The package is a piece – but it is a small piece – of what needs to be doneAlbert Lin“We are at a place where the scale of what needs to be done and the amount of time we have left,” she said, “every tool at our disposal is going to be needed.”‘A small piece of what needs to be done’Though the negotiating process left big concessions, including a continued commitment to oil and gas extraction alongside clean-energy provisions, the IRA pledges roughly $370bn for climate investments and promises a 40% reduction in emissions from 2005 levels over the next decade.It’s packed with provisions that directly address problems being felt across the west, including $4bn for water saving measures and conservation programs for the beleaguered Colorado River basin. There will be $2.6bn set aside for conservation, restoration, and protection of coastal and marine habitats, $3bn to address pollution in frontline communities where people of color are disproportionately harmed by bad air quality, and big investments to fund the transition to a clean energy economy, including tax credits to lower the cost of electric vehicles and $3bn to electrify high-polluting ports.Advocates are also celebrating a $5bn focus on forests and wildfire resilience that includes $1.8bn set aside for the forest service. The long-underfunded federal agency is tasked with managing much of the wildfire prevention work, including reducing the vegetation that turns to tinder when landscapes warm and dry. Forest treatments are scientifically proven to be an effective tool to reduce the risks of catastrophic fire and could help prevent devastation.A road damaged by flash floods in the Mojave national preserve in California. Photograph: APAlbert Lin, environmental law professor at the University of California, Davis, called the plan “a big step forward”.In the absence of federal action in recent years, the burden of this work has largely fallen on other actors – states, local governments, NGOs and Indigenous nations. While a splurge in financing and programs will help turn the tide, Lin cautioned that other agencies can’t lose their focus.“The package is a piece – but it is a small piece – of what needs to be done,” he said.Moreover, there are concerns that the forest service will struggle to meet the challenge at hand – even with the added cash.After years of being starved of funding, the agency has fallen behind in staffing and executing the treatments needed to combat catastrophic fire, which were worsened by a century of fire suppression and poor land management. The results have been deadly – hampering battles against behemoth blazes and leaving important mitigation work undone across the west.It’s still unclear how effective the agency will be at changing course. It’s struggling with worker retention and the task ahead is gargantuan.Water levels in Lake Mead are at the lowest level since April 1937 when the reservoir was filled for the first time. Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty Images“The agency can’t spend this money fast enough,” Susan Jane Brown, the wildlands program director at the Western Environmental Law Center, said, adding that along with systemic problems, a culture shift may be required to achieve what Congress has intended with the bill. Even as the research mounts that prescribed burning along with the mechanical removal of vegetation is an important part of preventing fires, the agency shied away from the tool after a controlled burn sparked New Mexico’s largest fire in state history.“You can throw all the money you want at some of these issues but if you don’t have the workforce and you don’t have the capacity to get things done, it doesn’t do anything,” said Patrick Bigger, the research director at the Climate and Community project.Walking the talkEven if agencies can rise to the challenge, it will not stave off the changes already in motion. Forest treatments are vital but little can be done when temperatures spike and the winds blow across the desiccated hillsides, conditions that will increasingly align in a warmer world. The forested landscapes are already starting to change and the tall trees once adapted to flames are perishing.“We humans may have created a planet that simply can’t sustain forests in the locations that we have become accustomed to having them,” Brown said. She encouraged advocates to keep a watchful eye on the actions taken next.A firetruck drives along California Highway 96 as the McKinney fire burns in Klamath national forest, California. Photograph: Noah Berger/APScorched vehicles and residences line the Oaks mobile home park in the Klamath River community. Photograph: Noah Berger/APPartnerships – especially with tribes and environmental justice groups – will be crucial to ensuring the impact goes beyond just another boon to the budget.“I hope the forest service actually walks its talk and partners with communities and tribes and NGOs,” she said. “An infusion of cash is going to help – but only if it is spent wisely.”For Bigger, that means ensuring more investments into the administration of projects and managers to oversee partnerships. Agencies can’t do this work in a vacuum. Already, he said, grant money has been left on the table, “because there’s nobody there to administer that money”.Advocates across the American west are gearing up for the next phase of the climate movement, one that – at least for now – may be aided by new levels of federal support.“The way we have come to think about it is about resetting the playing field,” he said, noting that the legislation – with its positives and negatives – gives advocates new ground on which to fight. “There are going to be a lot of fights ahead.”",2022-08-16
 This article is more than 1 month oldBacklash forces EPA to pause toxic PFAS waste imports to US from NetherlandsThis article is more than 1 month old,North Carolina residents push back against environmental agency bringing 4m lbs of ‘forever chemical’ waste to region,['Tom Perkins'],"The federal US government has paused the importation of millions of pounds of toxic PFAS “forever chemical” waste from the Netherlands following intense backlash from residents near a North Carolina facility that would receive the substances.Local media last month revealed the Environmental Protection Agency had quietly approved a permit for chemical manufacturer Chemours to import about 4m lbs of waste over the next year, sparking fears of further pollution in a region already thoroughly contaminated by the company’s operations.US chemical industry likely spent $110m trying to thwart PFAS legislation, study findsRead moreThe increased amount of PFAS waste processed locally would be “devastating”, said Emily Donovan, co-founder of the Clean Cape Fear non-profit.“We are tired of being a PFAS sacrifice zone and watching our friends suffer and die,” Donovan said.PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a class of about 15,000 compounds most frequently used to make products water-, stain- and grease-resistant. They have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease and a range of other serious health problems. They are dubbed “forever chemicals” because most do not degrade in the environment.Chemours, which was spun off from DuPont in 2015 to shield the latter from legal liability, is thought to be responsible for contaminating the air, soil, crops and water across hundreds of square miles in south-east North Carolina with PFAS. Many residents allege it has sickened and killed people on a wide scale, and the United Nations is investigating human rights violations over the company’s pollution.A 2019 state consent order required the company to rein in Fayetteville Works’ pollution, but the EPA still in September signed off on as much as 100 shipments from Chemours’ Dordrecht facility to Fayetteville via the Port of Wilmington, an agency document shows.Chemours would recycle or reuse waste for one kind of PFAS compound, HFPO-dimer acid, commonly called GenX, which is highly toxic at low levels of exposure. It is unclear if that process will lead to more emissions and environmental contamination at the Fayetteville facility.Local residents and public health advocates were “blindsided” by the news, Donovan said.“That’s what we’re really concerned about – this decision was created in a vacuum of transparency,” she said. “Where was the communication to the impacted communities that have been engaged on this topic?”North Carolina’s governor, Roy Cooper, also said his administration was unaware of the new permit, and in early November sent a letter to the EPA urging it to reverse its permit approval.“It was with dismay that we learned that EPA recently approved the importation,” Cooper wrote.The EPA said it implemented a pause “In response to recent concerns expressed by stakeholders including the state of North Carolina” and local residents.In 2018, the Trump EPA ordered Chemours to halt shipments because of questions over the waste’s handling and outdated data. The company had started shipping about 10 metric tons of waste in 2014, and that grew to about 250 metric tons by 2018.Some of the substance was also being sent to deep well injection facilities, where toxic waste is stored far into the earth’s crust. The wells are prone to leaking and contaminating groundwater, and it’s unclear if the new PFAS shipments will all be reused, or if some will be disposed of in wells.From 2014 until at least 2017, some of the Dordrecht waste was sent to an Italian facility, but it contaminated groundwater and authorities in the region suspended some of the company’s operations.It is unclear why the EPA changed positions and approved the permit, but it told the Dutch media outlet ITL Chemours had “provided confidential business information that supported providing the conditional consent”.The waste cannot be disposed of in the Netherlands because the country has in place stricter GenX regulations, and has designated it as a hazardous substance. The US federal government is considering whether to designate GenX as a hazardous substance through several channels, but the process has stalled, Donovan said.The letter states none of the substances being imported are hazardous waste, she added, which is frustrating local residents because the EPA has been slow in the designation process.“They’re going to create a problem and let it fester,” she said.A Chemours spokesperson told the Fayetteville Observer the US plant was authorized to receive up to 4m lbs of waste, but the company will probably import far less.“Chemours’ Fayetteville Works has emissions control technologies in place to abate emissions of fluorinated compounds in accordance with our operating permits and levels contained in the consent order,” the spokesperson said.But Donovan said it was unreasonable to allow more waste to be imported to a plant that still has yet to clean up the pollution in its backyard.“We haven’t begun to see nearly the amount of cleanup and recovery that we know we deserve for the scope of contamination crisis here, but now the EPA is going to allow this massive amount of GenX waste to be imported?” she said.",2023-11-22
"  Indigenous peoples face rise in rights abuses during pandemic, report finds",Increasing land grabs endangering forest communities and wildlife as governments expand mining and agriculture to combat economic impact of Covid,"['The age of extinction is supported by', 'About this content', 'Patrick Greenfield', '@pgreenfielduk']","Indigenous communities in some of the world’s most forested tropical countries have faced a wave of human rights abuses during the Covid-19 pandemic as governments prioritise extractive industries in economic recovery plans, according to a new report.New mines, infrastructure projects and agricultural plantations in Brazil, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Indonesia and Peru are driving land grabs and violence against indigenous peoples as governments seek to revive economies hit by the pandemic, research by the NGO Forest Peoples Programme has found.Social and environmental protections for indigenous communities have been set aside in the five countries in favour of new projects, leading to a rise in violence and deforestation on and around indigenous lands, according to the report produced by the NGO, Yale Law School researchers and the School of Law at Middlesex University London.An oil pipeline through Wampis territory in the Peruvian Amazon. The government has reportedly moved to expand extractive industries during the pandemic. Photograph: Jacob Balzani Loov/Forest Peoples ProgrammeThe authors warn that raw materials from the new extractive projects are likely to filter into global supply chains and enter western markets. They have called on businesses to strengthen protections for human rights and tropical forests.“Indigenous peoples are seeing their rights stripped away as the lands that have long been their homes are stripped away as well,” said James Silk, Binger clinical professor of human rights at Yale Law School and co-author of the report.“Corporations in the extractive industries have aggressively pushed governments to let them exploit resources on indigenous lands, promising economic revitalisation, but ignoring the devastating effect on indigenous communities. The result is a cascade of human rights violations and accelerating contributions to global warming.”The report, titled Rolling Back Social and Environmental Safeguards in the Time of Covid-19, was produced in collaboration with affected communities. It found that the governments in Brazil, Colombia, DRC, Indonesia and Peru were prioritising the expansion of logging, industrial agriculture and the energy sector in or near indigenous territories.Domestic and international laws that prohibit land grabs were not being enforced by the state, resulting in a rise in deforestation in 2020 that was likely to continue this year, the researchers said.Trust our expertise or face catastrophe, Amazon peoples warn on environmentRead moreIndigenous people who try to assert their rights are facing increased threat of criminal prosecution and arrest, according to the report.“Indigenous groups started contacting organisations like the Forest Peoples Programme early on in the pandemic. Governments were prioritising big oil, mining projects and infrastructure projects at a time when lockdowns were happening. Communities were unable to protect themselves,” Cathal Doyle of the School of Law at Middlesex University said.“Studies repeatedly show that the best, most conserved biodiversity and forests are in lands where you have indigenous communities. We’re dependent on them for addressing the existential crises that we face in the coming decades,” he continued.Samela Sateré-Mawé, 23, shows a protective mask made by her women’s association in Manaus, Brazil.

 Chemical giants hid dangers of ‘forever chemicals’ in food packaging,"The chemicals, called 6:2 FTOH, are now linked to a range of serious health issues, and Americans are still being exposed to them",['Tom Perkins'],"Chemical giants DuPont and Daikin knew the dangers of a PFAS compound widely used in food packaging since 2010, but hid them from the public and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), company studies obtained by the Guardian reveal.The chemicals, called 6:2 FTOH, are now linked to a range of serious health issues, and Americans are still being exposed to them in greaseproof pizza boxes, carryout containers, fast-food wrappers, and paperboard packaging.Plummeting sperm counts, shrinking penises: toxic chemicals threaten humanity | Erin BrockovichRead moreThe companies initially told the FDA that the compounds were safer and less likely to accumulate in humans than older types of PFAS, also known as “forever chemicals” and submitted internal studies to support that claim.But Daikin withheld a 2009 study that indicated toxicity to lab rats’ livers and kidneys, while DuPont in 2012 did not alert the FDA or public to new internal data that indicated that the chemical stays in animals’ bodies for much longer than initially thought.Science from industry, the FDA and independent researchers now links 6:2 FTOH to kidney disease, liver damage, cancer, neurological damage, developmental problems and autoimmune disorders, while researchers also found higher mortality rates among young animals and mothers exposed to the chemicals.Had the FDA seen the data, it is unlikely that it would have approved 6:2 FTOH, said Maricel Maffini, an independent researcher who studies PFAS in food packaging. And though Daikin may have broken the law, it and DuPont, which has previously been caught hiding studies that suggest toxicity in PFAS, are not facing any repercussions.“Those things shouldn’t happen, and if they do then there should be consequences, but oversight is lax,” Maffini said.I think people need to be able to rely on the FDA to turn science at the agency into real action, and right now that doesn’t seem to be the caseTom NeltnerIn 2020, the FDA reached agreements with some major PFAS manufacturers to voluntarily stop using 6:2 FTOH compounds in food packaging within five years. But documents show that the FDA first became aware of DuPont’s hidden study in 2015, and public health advocates say a 10-year timeline to reassess and remove the chemical is unacceptable.Moreover, the FDA phase-out only applies to 6:2 FTOH compounds, and does not include other similar “short chain” PFAS, raising questions about whether the agency is fully protecting the public from the class of potentially toxic chemicals.“I think people need to be able to rely on the FDA to turn science at the agency into real action, and right now that doesn’t seem to be the case,” said Tom Neltner, chemicals policy director with the Environmental Defense Fund. He and Maffini obtained the companies’ studies and related documents from Daikin’s website and the FDA through Freedom of Information Act requests.The 6:2 FTOH compound is part of a newer generation of “short chain” PFAS that were designed to replace older and supposedly more harmful “long chain” PFAS. The industry claims that short chain compounds are uniformly safe and “practically non-toxic”. However, independent researchers like Erika Schreder, science director for Toxic Free Future, have found that PFAS, regardless of chain length, accumulate in the environment and humans, and are toxic.“The fact that we continue to uncover evidence that the current-use PFAS have similar toxicity to the [long chain] compounds that have been phased out makes a strong argument for regulating harmful chemicals like PFAS as a class,” Schreder said.In a statement to the Guardian, an FDA spokesperson defended the agency’s handling of 6:2 FTOH, noting that the studies “do not demonstrate an imminent health hazard” and more studies were needed to draw concrete conclusions about its safety, and that of other short chain PFAS.Daikin and Chemours, a company that in 2015 was spun off from DuPont’s PFAS division, did not respond to requests for comment.DuPont hides alarming new dataIndustry reports and communications among the FDA and PFAS producers between 2008 and 2020 show how a sequence of inadequate chemical safety analyses, hidden studies and lax oversight created a scenario in which Americans continue to be exposed to the dangerous compound in food packaging.The 2008 6:2 FTOH studies that DuPont submitted to the FDA monitored the impact of high exposure levels to the chemical on two generations of lab rats. The animals suffered kidney failure, liver damage, mammary gland problems, mottled teeth and other issues. However, DuPont and the FDA felt that humans’ exposure would be much lower and, with little supporting evidence, believed that the short chain PFAS would not accumulate in human bodies, Maffini said.She called such studies on PFAS “inaccurate and inappropriate” because the chemicals are toxic at “extremely low levels” and are known to accumulate in animals’ bodies.Dupont conducted a study that found 6:2 FTOH stayed in lab animals’ bodies for longer than previously thought but did not inform the FDA or publish the study. Photograph: Laurent Gilliéron/EPAIndeed, the longer-term DuPont study completed in 2012 found that 6:2 FTOH stayed in lab animals’ bodies for longer than previously thought. Still, DuPont did not alert the FDA or publish the study.Though the law does not require companies to make such information public, the results strongly suggested a health threat, and DuPont “had an ethical obligation to not just publish it, but flag it for the FDA”, Neltner said.Three years later, DuPont partially summarized its 2012 findings in a peer-reviewed 6:2 FTOH study that Maffini said used “cherry-picked” data to support its claim that the compound was safe. Though it omitted the 2012 study’s details, communications show it caught the attention of the FDA, which wrote that the study alerted the agency “to potential biopersistence of [6:2 FTOH] and raised potential safety concerns”.That triggered a safety review, but the process would drag out for about five years as Americans continued to be exposed.Even when DuPont in its 2008 study reported some health problems in lab animals at high exposure levels, it did so in a way that appears designed to confuse, Maffini noted. One passage that revealed that high doses of the chemical lead to blood in rats’ urine read that the doses “resulted in a significant reduction in the number of female rats with blood absent in the urine”.Daikin omits damning scienceThe FDA in 2009 approved the Daikin-developed 6:2 FTOH compound for use in food packaging, partly basing the decision on the company’s studies that suggested that the chemical was non-toxic.But about 10 years later, Maffini and Neltner discovered that Daikin had withheld two studies from the FDA that suggested toxicity to lab animals’ livers and kidneys at low exposure levels – one completed before the FDA approved the chemical, and one after.They caught the omission by cross-checking studies for the chemical posted to Daikin’s website with those submitted to the FDA, and found the data on health effects was never given to the agency. Neltner noted that the law required the first study to be submitted to the FDA. Maffini said they asked Daikin about the omission and the company responded by removing the report from its website, but it can still be found using the Wayback machine site.As part of its safety review of the chemical, the FDA convened a 2018 meeting with Chemours, Daikin and others in the industry at which the agency requested studies related to 6:2 FTOH. Communications confirm that the FDA did not previously have DuPont’s 2012 study or Daikin’s 2007 study.Between 2018 and 2020, three FDA analyses that included Daikin’s and DuPont’s studies broadly concluded that 6:2 FTOH may stick in the human body for years and could be more toxic than the companies had previously suggested.The agency’s own scientists were in a rush to get it out of the marketplace so it’s really hard to understand why the FDA agreed to a five-year phase-outMaricel MaffiniA 2019 communication between the FDA and the PFAS manufacturer Asahi showed urgency on the part of the agency to get the chemical removed from the market, but in July 2020 it announced that four major producers of the compound had agreed to have all food packaging with 6:2 FTOH off the shelves by 2025.In its announcement, the FDA wrote that the extended timeline “balances uncertainty about the potential for public health risks with minimizing potential market disruptions to food packaging supply chains during the Covid-19 public health emergency”.Maffini questioned whether the public’s health was being put first.“The agency’s own scientists were in a rush to get it out of the marketplace so it’s really hard to understand why the FDA agreed to a five-year phase-out,” she said.Neltner also underscored what he and Maffini view as other deficiencies in the FDA’s chemical approval process that contributed to the 6:2 FTOH problem: the agency does not demand sufficient safety data up front and there is no systematic reassessment to determine whether chemicals are safe after they are sent to the market.The FDA again defended its process, stating that the agency “updates our safety assessments as appropriate” and said industry “must provide sufficient information demonstrating that” chemicals are safe.But Neltner said the problems with 6:2 FTOH suggest otherwise.“They’re making grossly inaccurate assumptions that are not defensible,” Neltner said.",2022-01-05
,Sisi’s Egypt is making a big show of solar panels and biodegradable straws ahead of next month’s climate summit – but in reality the regime imprisons activists and bans research. The climate movement should not play along,,"No one knows what happened to the lost climate letter. All that is known is this: Alaa Abd El-Fattah, one of Egypt’s most high-profile political prisoners, wrote it while on a hunger strike in his Cairo prison cell last month. It was, he explained later, “about global warming because of the news from Pakistan”. He was concerned about the floods that displaced 33 million people, and what that cataclysm foretold about climate hardships and paltry state responses to come.A visionary technologist and intellectual, Abd El-Fattah’s first name – along with the hashtag #FreeAlaa – have become synonymous with the 2011 pro-democracy revolution that turned Cairo’s Tahrir Square into a surging sea of young people that ended the three-decade rule of Egypt’s dictator Hosni Mubarak. Behind bars almost continuously for the past decade, Abd El-Fattah is able to send and receive letters once a week. Earlier this year, a collection of his prison writings was published as the widely celebrated book You Have Not Yet Been Defeated.Abd El-Fattah’s family and friends live for those weekly letters. Especially since 2 April, when he started a hunger strike, ingesting only water and salt at first, and then just 100 calories a day (the body needs closer to 2,000). Abd El-Fattah’s strike is a protest against his imprisonment for the crime of “spreading false news” – ostensibly because he shared a Facebook post about the torture of another prisoner. Everyone knows, however, that his imprisonment is intended to send a message to any future young revolutionaries who get democratic dreams in their heads. With his strike, Abd El-Fattah is attempting to pressure his jailers to grant important concessions, including access to the British consulate (Abd El-Fattah’s mother was born in England, so he was able to obtain British citizenship). His jailers have so far refused, and so he continues to waste away. “He has become a skeleton with a lucid mind,” his sister Mona Seif said recently.The longer the hunger strike wears on, the more precious those weekly letters become. For his family, they are nothing less than proof of life. Yet on the week he wrote about climate breakdown, the letter never made it to Abd El-Fattah’s mother, Laila Soueif, a human rights defender and intellectual in her own right. Perhaps, he speculated in subsequent correspondence to her, his jailer had “spilled his coffee over the letter”. More likely, it was deemed to touch on forbidden “high politics” – even though Abd El-Fattah says he was careful not to so much as mention the Egyptian government, or even “the upcoming conference”.That last bit is important. It’s a reference to the fact that next month, beginning on 6 November, the resort of Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt will play host to this year’s United Nations climate summit, Cop27. Tens of thousands of delegates – world leaders, ministers, envoys, appointed bureaucrats, as well as climate activists, NGO observers and journalists – will descend on the city, their chests bedecked in lanyards and colour-coded badges.Which is why that lost letter is significant. There is something unbearably moving about the thought of Abd El-Fattah – despite the decade of indignities he and his family have suffered – sitting in his cell thinking about our warming world. There he is, slowly starving, yet still worrying about floods in Pakistan and extremism in India and crashing currency in the UK and Lula’s presidential candidacy in Brazil, all of which get a mention in his recent letters, shared with me by his family.There is also, frankly, something shaming about it. Because while Abd El-Fattah thinks about the world, it’s not at all clear that the world heading to Egypt for the climate summit is thinking much about him. Or about the estimated 60,000 other political prisoners behind bars in Egypt, where barbaric forms of torture reportedly take place on an “assembly line”. Or about the Egyptian human rights and environmental activists, as well as critical journalists and academics, who have been harassed, spied on and barred from travel as part of what Human Rights Watch calls Egypt’s “general atmosphere of fear” and “relentless crackdown on civil society”.Alaa Abd El-Fattah in Cairo. Photograph: Khaled Desouki/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Egyptian regime is eager to celebrate its official climate “youth leaders”, holding them up as symbols of hope in the battle against warming. But it’s hard not to think of the courageous youth leaders of the Arab spring, many of them now prematurely aged by more than a decade of state violence and harassment from systems that are lavishly bankrolled by military aid from western powers, particularly the US. It’s almost as if those activists have just been substituted by newer, less troublesome models.“I’m the ghost of spring past,” Abd El-Fattah wrote about himself in 2019. That ghost will haunt the coming summit, sending a chill through its every high-minded word. The silent question it poses is stark: if international solidarity is too weak to save Abd El-Fattah – the symbol of a generation’s dreams – what hope do we have of saving a habitable home?Mohammed Rafi Arefin, assistant professor of geography at the University of British Columbia, who has researched urban environmental politics in Egypt, points out that “every United Nations climate summit presents a complex calculus of costs and benefits”. There is the carbon spewed into the atmosphere as delegates travel there, the price of two weeks in hotels (steep for grassroots organisations), and the public relations bonanza enjoyed by the host government, which invariably positions itself as an eco-champion, never mind evidence to the contrary.Yet there are also benefits: the fact that, for those two weeks, the climate crisis makes global news, often providing media platforms for powerful voices on the frontlines, from the Brazilian Amazon to Tuvalu. And there is the international networking and solidarity that takes place when local organisers in the host country stage counter-summits and “toxic tours” to reveal the reality behind their government’s green posturing. And, of course, there are the deals that get negotiated and funds that are pledged to the poorest and worst affected. But these are non-binding, and as Greta Thunberg so memorably put it, much of it has amounted to little more than “Blah, blah, blah”.With the upcoming climate summit in Egypt, Arefin tells me, “The usual calculus has changed. The balance has tipped.” In addition to the carbon and the cost, the host government – who will get the chance to preen green before the world – is not your standard double-talking liberal democracy. “It is,” he says, “the most repressive regime in the history of the modern Egyptian state.” Led by Gen Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, who seized power in a military coup in 2013 (and has held on to it through sham elections ever since), the regime is, according to human rights organisations, one of the most brutal and repressive in the world. Since taking power less than a decade ago, it has built more than two dozen new prisons.Of course, you’d never know it from the way Egypt is marketing itself ahead of the summit. A promotional video on the Cop27 official website welcomes delegates to the “green city” of Sharm el-Sheik and shows young actors – including men with scruffy beards and necklaces clearly meant to look like environmental activists – enjoying non-plastic straws and biodegradable food containers as they take selfies on the beach, enjoy outdoor showers and drive electric vehicles to the desert to ride camels.While I was watching the video, it struck me that Sisi has decided to use the summit to stage a new kind of reality show, one in which actors “play” activists who look remarkably like the actual activists who are suffering under torture in his rapidly expanding archipelago of prisons. This summit is going far beyond greenwashing a polluting state – it’s greenwashing a police state.A demonstration against Egypt’s government in Cairo in 2015. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesThe Egyptian communities and organisations most affected by environmental pollution and rising temperatures will be nowhere to be found in Sharm el-Sheikh. There will be no toxic tours, or lively counter-summits, where locals get to school international delegates about the truth behind their government’s PR. Organising events like this would land Egyptians in prison for spreading “false news” or for violating the protest ban.International delegates can’t even read up much on current pollution and environmental despoliation in Egypt in academic or NGO reports because of a draconian 2019 law that requires researchers to get government permission before releasing information considered “political”. (The whole country is gagged, and hundreds of websites are blocked, including the indispensable and perennially harassed Mada Masr.) Human Rights Watch reports that groups have been forced to rein in and scale back their research under these new constraints, and “one prominent Egyptian environmental group disbanded its research unit because it became impossible to work in the field”. Tellingly, not a single one of the environmentalists who spoke to Human Rights Watch about censorship and repression was willing to use their real name because reprisals are so severe.Arefin, who conducted extensive research on waste and flooding in Egyptian cities before this latest round of censorious laws, told me that he and other critical academics and journalists “are no longer able to do that work. Egypt’s environmental harms now happen in the dark.” And those who break the rules and try to turn on the lights end up in dark cells – or worse.Abd El-Fattah’s sister Mona Seif, who has spent years lobbying for her brother’s release and for the release of other political prisoners, wrote recently on Twitter: “The reality most of those participating in #Cop27 are choosing to ignore is … in countries like #Egypt your true allies, the ones who actually give a damn about the planet’s future are those languishing in prisons.”So, unlike every other climate summit in recent memory, this one will have no authentic local partners. There will be some Egyptians at the summit claiming to represent “civil society”. And some of them do. The trouble is that, however well-intentioned, they too are bit players in Sisi’s beachside reality show; in a departure of usual UN rules, almost all have been vetted and approved by the government. That same Human Rights Watch report, published last month, explains that these groups have been invited to speak only on “welcome” topics.What, for the regime, is welcome? “Trash collection, recycling, renewable energy, food security, and climate finance”. What topics are unwelcome? “Those that point out the government’s failure to protect people’s rights against damage caused by corporate interests, including issues relating to water security, industrial pollution, and environmental harm from real estate, tourism development, and agribusiness,” according to the report. Also unwelcome: “The environmental impact[s] of Egypt’s vast and opaque military business activity … are particularly sensitive, as are ‘national’ infrastructure projects such as a new administrative capital, many of which are associated with the president’s office or the military.” And definitely don’t talk about Coca-Cola’s plastic pollution and water use – because Coke is one of the summit’s proud official sponsors.In short, if you want to put up solar panels or pick up litter, you can probably get a badge to come to Sharm el-Sheikh. But if you want to talk about the health and climate impacts of Egypt’s coal-powered cement plants, or the paving over of some of the last green spaces in Cairo, you are more likely to get a visit from the secret police – or from the Ministry of Social Solidarity. And if, as an Egyptian, you question Sisi’s credibility to speak on behalf of Africa’s poor and climate-vulnerable populations, given the deepening hunger and desperation of his own people, you had better do it from outside the country.So far, hosting the summit has proved nothing short of a bonanza for Sisi, a man Donald Trump reportedly referred to as my “favourite dictator”. There is the boon to coastal tourism, which crashed in recent years, and the regime is clearly hoping its videos of outdoor showers and camel rides will inspire more. But that’s just the beginning of the green gold rush. Late last month, British International Investment (BII), which is backed by the UK government, giddily announced that it was “investing $100m to support local startups” in Egypt. It is also the majority owner in Globeleq, which ahead of Cop27 has announced an $11bn deal to build up green hydrogen production in Egypt. At the same time, the BII stressed its “commitment to strengthen its partnership with Egypt and increase climate finance to support the country’s green growth”.This is the same government that appears to have done very little to secure the release of Abd El-Fattah, despite his British citizenship and his hunger strike. Unfortunately for him, Abd El-Fattah’s fate was for months in the hands of Liz Truss who, before becoming Britain’s spectacularly callous and inept prime minister, was its spectacularly callous and inept foreign secretary. She could have used some of those billions in investment and development aid to leverage the release of a fellow citizen. (Last week, Gillian Keegan, minister for Africa at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, reported that she had met Egypt’s ambassador to the UK for the first time, and “raised the case of Alaa Abd El-Fattah”.)Germany’s moral failures are equally dismal. When Green party co-leader Annalena Baerbock became the country’s first female foreign minister last December, she announced a new “values-based foreign policy” – one that would prioritise human rights and climate concerns. Germany is one of Egypt’s major donors and trading partners, so, like the UK, it certainly has a card to play. But instead of pressure on human rights, Baerbock has provided Sisi with priceless propaganda opportunities, including co-hosting the Petersberg Climate Dialogue with him in Berlin in July, at which the ruthless dictator was able to rebrand himself as a green leader.Egyptian president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi (centre) attending a climate meeting in Berlin earlier this year. Photograph: Clemens Bilan/EPAAnd given the difficulties caused by Germany’s reliance on Russian gas, Egypt is eagerly positioning itself to provide replacement gas and hydrogen. Meanwhile, German giant Siemens Mobility has announced a “historic” multibillion-dollar contract to build electrified high-speed trains across Egypt.The international injections of green cash are flowing just in time for Sisi’s troubled regime. Facing a tsunami of global crises (inflation, pandemic, food shortages, increased fuel prices, drought, debt) on top of its systemic mismanagement and corruption, Egypt is on the edge of defaulting on its foreign debt – a volatile situation that could well destabilise Sisi’s rule. In this context, the climate summit is not merely a PR opportunity – it is a lifeline.Though reluctant to give up on the process, most serious climate activists readily concede that these summits produce little by way of science-based climate action. Year after year since they began, emissions keep going up. What, then, is the good of supporting this year’s summit when the one thing it is set to absolutely accomplish is the further entrenchment and enrichment of a regime that, by any ethical standard, deserves pariah status?As Arefin asks: “At what point do we say ‘enough’?”For months, Egyptians in exile in Europe and the US have been pleading with NGOs to put their country’s political prisoners on the agenda of negotiations leading up to the summit. But that was never prioritised.They were told that this is “Africa’s Cop” (Cop stands for Conference of the Parties, or signatories to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change); and that, despite all the prior failures, this Cop, the 27th, would finally get serious about “implementation” and “loss and damage” – UN-speak for the hope that the wealthy, high-polluting countries will finally pay what they owe to poor nations, like Pakistan, that have contributed next to nothing in carbon emissions, yet are bearing the bulk of the soaring costs.The clear implication has been that the summit is too serious and too important to be sidetracked by the supposedly small matter of the host country’s human rights record. But is Cop27 really going to champion climate justice? Is it going to bring green energy and clean transit and food sovereignty to the poor? Will the summit truly confront climate debt and reparations, as many are claiming? If only.The case for climate reparations is obvious, writes Egyptian journalist, film-maker, and novelist Omar Robert Hamilton, in a magisterial essay. “The harder question is how to design a system of reparations that does not entrench authoritarian state powers” – one that ensures that the funds actually contribute to genuinely post-carbon policies. “This should be at the core of Cop negotiations between southern and northern countries – [but] the ones doing the negotiating for the south tend to be authoritarian state powers whose short-term interests are even more graspingly fragile than those of oil executives.”In short, despite the talk in climate circles of this being the “implementation” Cop, Egypt’s summit will probably achieve as little by way of real climate action as all the others before. But that does not mean it won’t achieve anything: when it comes to propping up a torture regime, showering it with cash and image-cleansing photo ops, Cop27 is already a lavish gift.Abd El-Fattah has long been a symbol of Egypt’s violently extinguished revolution. But as the summit approaches, he is becoming symbolic of something else, too: the “sacrifice zone” mentality at the heart of the climate crisis. This is the idea that some places and some people can be unseen, discounted and written off – all in the name of progress. We’ve seen the mentality at work when communities are poisoned to extract and refine fossil fuels and minerals. We’ve seen it when those communities are sacrificed in the name of getting a climate bill passed that does not protect them. And now we are seeing it in the context of an international climate summit, with the rights of the people living in the host country sacrificed and unseen in the name of the mirage of “real progress” in the negotiations.If last year’s summit in Glasgow was about “blah, blah, blah”, this one’s meaning, even before it starts, is more ominous. This summit is about blood, blood, blood. The blood of the roughly 1,000 protesters massacred by Egyptian forces to secure power for its current ruler. The blood of those who continue to be assassinated. The blood of those beaten in the streets and tortured in prisons. The blood of people like Abd El-Fattah.There may still be time to change that script, and for the summit to become a searchlight that illuminates the connections between surging authoritarianism and climate chaos around the world – like the way far-right leaders such as Italy’s Giorgia Meloni stoke fear of refugees, including those fleeing climate breakdown, to fuel their rise, and how the EU showers brutal leaders such as Sisi with cash so that he continues to prevent Africans from reaching their shores. There is still time to make the case that climate justice is impossible without political freedoms.“Unlike me, you have not yet been defeated.” Alaa Abd El-Fattah wrote those words in 2017. He had been invited to deliver a speech to RightsCon, the annual confab about human rights in the digital age sponsored by all the big tech companies. The conference was taking place in the US, but because Abd El-Fattah was behind bars in the notorious Tora prison (it had been four years at that point), he sent a letter instead. It’s a brilliant text, about the imperative to protect the internet as a space of creativity, experimentation and freedom. And it is also a challenge to those who are not (yet) behind bars, who have the freedom to do things like travelling to conferences to talk about justice and democracy and human rights. In that freedom lies responsibility. A responsibility not just to be free, but also to act free, to use freedom to its full transformational potential, before it’s too late.Pollution in the River Nile in Cairo.  Photograph: Khaled Desouki/AFP/Getty ImagesAs tens of thousands of relatively free Cop27 delegates prepare to fly to Sharm el-Sheikh, checking the average November temperatures (highs of 28C), packing appropriately (light shirts, sandals, a bathing suit – because you never know), Abd El-Fattah’s words about the responsibilities that come with being undefeated take on a new urgency. Given the intensive surveillance and threat that Egyptians attending the summit will be facing, how will the foreigners attending deploy their freedom? Their state of being not yet defeated?Will they behave as if Egypt is merely a backdrop, not an actual country where people just like them have fought and died for the same freedoms they have, and against the same economic interests that are destabilising our planetary and political climates? Or will they find ways to bring some of the gruesome truths of Egypt’s prisons into the green glitz of the conference centre? Speak some of the names of the prisoners? Will they search out the few remaining civil society organisations in Cairo – such as those who came together under copcivicspace.net – and see how they can help?Abd El-Fattah would be the first to say that what’s needed is neither pity nor charity. Rather, as a committed internationalist who has stood in solidarity with many struggles, from Chiapas to Palestine, he called for comrades in a battle that has fronts in every nation. “We reach out to you,” he wrote in that RightsCon letter from prison, “not in search of powerful allies but because we confront the same global problems, and share universal values, and with a firm belief in the power of solidarity.”Anti-democratic and fascistic forces are surging around the world. In country after country, freedoms are precarious or slipping away. And all of this is connected. Political tides move in waves across borders, for better and for worse – which is why international solidarity can never be sacrificed in the name of expediency for some greater goal of “progress”. Egypt’s revolution was inspired by Tunisia’s, and in turn, “the spirit of Tahrir” spread around the world. It helped inspire other youth-led movements in Europe and North America, including Occupy Wall Street, which in turn helped birth new anti-capitalist and eco-socialist politics. In fact, you can draw a pretty straight line from Tahrir to Occupy, to Bernie Sanders’s 2016 US presidential campaign, to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s election to Congress and her championing of the Green New Deal.Where human rights are under attack, so too is the natural world. After all, the communities and organisations facing the most severe state repression and violence around the world – whether they live in the Philippines or Canada or Brazil or the US – are overwhelmingly made up of Indigenous peoples trying to protect their territories from polluting extractive projects, many of which are also driving the climate crisis. Defending human rights, wherever we live, is therefore inextricable from defending a liveable planet.Moreover, the extent to which some governments are finally introducing meaningful climate legislation is also bound up with political freedoms. The US Senate and the Biden administration have finally been dragged into passing the Inflation Reduction Act – flawed as it is. This happened as a direct result of public pressure, investigative journalism, civil disobedience, sit-ins in legislative offices, lawsuits and every other tool available in the nonviolent arsenal. And, ultimately, lawmakers got together to pass the act because they feared what would happen when they faced voters in November if they came to them empty-handed. If US politicians did not have to fear the public, because the public had a greater fear of them, none of this would have happened at all.One thing is certain: we will not win the kind of change that the climate crisis demands without the freedom to demonstrate, sit in, shame political leaders and tell the truth in public. If demonstrations are banned and inconvenient facts are criminalised as “false news”, as they are in Sisi’s Egypt, then it’s game over. Without the strikes, the protests and the investigative research, we would be in far worse shape than we are. And any one of those activities would be enough to land an Egyptian activist or journalist in a dark cell next to Abd El-Fattah’s.When news came that the next UN climate summit would be taking place in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egyptian activists, inside the country and in exile, could have called on the climate movement to boycott it. They chose not to, for a variety of reasons. But they did ask for solidarity. The Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies, for instance, called on the international community to use the summit “to shed more light on the crimes being committed in Egypt and urge the Egyptian authorities to change course”. There were high hopes that North American and European activists would push their governments to make their attendance and participation conditional on Egypt meeting basic human-rights requirements – including amnesty for prisoners of conscience in jail for “crimes” such as organising a demonstration, or posting an unflattering statement about the regime, or receiving a foreign grant.So far, with less than a month before the summit starts, the response from the global climate movement has been muted. Many groups have added their names to petitions; a handful of articles about the human rights situation during the summit have appeared; climate activists in Germany, many of them Egyptian exiles, have held small protests with signs saying “No Cop27 Until Alaa is Free” and “No Greenwashing Egypt’s Prisons”. But we have seen nothing like the kind of the international pressure that would worry Egypt’s rulers.Alaa Abd el-Fattah at the high court in Cairo in 2013. Photograph: Ed Giles/Getty ImagesIt’s hard to overstate the totalising nature of Sisi’s war on civil society. Human Rights Watch reports that, “In 2014… Sisi amended, by decree, the penal code to punish with life in prison or death sentence anyone requesting, receiving, or assisting the transfer of funds, whether from foreign sources or local organisations, with the aim of doing work that harms a ‘national interest’ or the country’s independence or undermining public security or safety.” The death sentence for receiving a grant. And yet all of the major US and European foundations will be in Sharm el-Sheikh, meeting with groups that they fund, and others that they might consider funding, inside a country where taking any of that money to tell the truth about environmental despoliation in Egypt can cost you your life.This is all a bit baffling. Why invite funders and green groups to Egypt when the regime has such obvious hostility toward these very activities domestically? The truth – uncomfortable for all who will be in attendance – is that nothing would serve Sisi more than to turn Sharm el-Sheik into a kind of nonprofit petting zoo, where international climate activists and funders can spend two weeks shouting about north-south injustice before the cameras, with a few state-approved local groups thrown in for authenticity’s sake. Why? Because then Egypt would look like something it most emphatically is not: a free and democratic society. A good source for your natural gas. Or a country suitable to entrust with a new IMF loan.By all accounts, the Egyptian government is frantically building a bubble in Sharm el-Sheikh, where it will impersonate something that looks sort of like a democracy. The question facing civil society groups is: will you play along – or will you do what you can to disrupt the show?In all the plans for next month’s Coca-Cola-sponsored climate summit, the most chilling detail is surely the announcement that this will be the first such gathering to have a Children and Youth Pavilion inside the official venue: a dedicated space that “will provide a convening place of talks, education, creativity, policy briefings, rest and relaxation, bringing together the voices of young people across the world”. This will allow youth to – get this – “speak truth to power”.I have no doubt that many young people in that pavilion will deliver powerful speeches, as they did in Glasgow and at climate summits before. Young people have become true climate leaders, and they have injected desperately needed urgency and moral clarity into many official climate spaces. That same moral clarity is needed now.A decade ago, young Egyptians didn’t have a state-sanctioned pavilion. They had a revolution. They flooded Tahrir Square demanding a different kind of country, one without the ever-present shadow of fear, one where teenagers didn’t disappear into police dungeons and reappear dead, their faces swollen and bloodied. That revolution overthrew a dictator who had ruled since before they were born. But then their dreams were crushed by political betrayals and violence. In one of his recent letters, Abd El-Fattah wrote of how painful it is to share his cell with teenagers who were arrested when they were children: “They were underage when they were put in prison and are fighting to get out before they reach legal adulthood.”One of the teens who helped take over the square in 2011 was Abd El-Fattah’s extraordinary younger sister Sanaa Seif. Just 17 at the time, Sanaa co-founded a revolutionary newspaper, Al Gornal, which published tens of thousands of copies and became a kind of voice of Tahrir. She also was an editor and camera person on the Oscar-nominated 2013 documentary film The Square. She has herself been imprisoned multiple times for speaking out against human rights abuses and for demanding her brother’s release. In an interview, she told me that she has a message for the young activists headed for that pavilion: “We tried. We did speak truth to power.” Now, she says, many activists are spending their 20s in prison. “When you go, remember that you can be the voice of other young people … Please, let’s maintain that heritage. Please do actually speak truth to power. It will have impact … eyes are on you.”But as the climate summit draws near, and Abd El-Fatah’s hunger strike wears on, Sanaa is losing patience with the large green groups that have so far been silent, seemingly out of fear of losing their badges or being stopped at the border. “Honestly I’m fed up with the hypocrisy of the climate movement,” she wrote on Twitter last week. “Outcries have been pouring from Egypt for months warning that this #COP27 will go far beyond greenwashing, that the ramifications on us will be horrible. Yet most are choosing to ignore the human rights situation.”This, she pointed out, is why climate activism is often seen as an elite exercise, disconnected from people with urgent daily concerns – such as getting their family members out of jail. “You’re guaranteeing that #ClimateAction remains an alien notion exclusive to the few who have the luxury to think beyond today,” she wrote. “Mitigating climate change and fighting for human rights are interlinked struggles, they shouldn’t be separated. Especially since we’re dealing with a regime that is propped up by companies like BP and Eni. And really, how hard is it to raise both issues? #FreeThemAll #FreeAlaa.”The news website that’s keeping press freedom alive in Egypt | Leslie T ChangRead moreIt isn’t hard – but it does take courage. The message activists should bring to the climate summit, whether they travel to Egypt or engage from afar, is simple: unless political freedoms are defended, there will be no meaningful climate action. Not in Egypt, nor anywhere else. These issues are intertwined, as are our fates.The hour is late, but there is still just enough time to get this right. Human Rights Watch argues that the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change secretariat, which sets the rules for these summits, should “develop human rights criteria that countries hosting future Cops must commit to meeting as part of the host agreement”. That’s too late for this summit, but it’s not too late for all of those who are concerned about climate justice to show solidarity with the revolutionaries who inspired millions around the world a decade ago, when they toppled a tyrant. There might even be time to scare Sisi enough with the prospect of a green PR nightmare by the Red Sea that he could decide to open the doors of some of his dungeons before all those cameras arrive. Because, as Alaa Abd El-Fattah reminds us from the desperation of his cell, we have not yet been defeated.This article first appeared in the InterceptDamian Carrington, Tess Khan and Ed Miliband will discuss Cop27 and the commitments that might be made there at a Guardian Live online event on 9 November 2022, 8pm-9pm GMT.

"Country diary: A sand hopper vanishes, too quick for the human eye","Lannacombe Beach, south Devon: They are crustaceans the size of a housefly, and their presence here shows the beach is healthy",['Tom Allan'],"Belly down on the grey-tan sand of a south Devon beach, I am turning out sandcastle after sandcastle from a green bucket with a starfish on it, when I notice that the sand is seething with life. “Grasshopper!” my almost-two-year-old daughter exclaims, and she’s half right. The creatures flicking away from my feet, and from the ruins of the sand turret she has taken such pleasure in demolishing, are in fact not insects, but sand hoppers (Talitrus saltator).I scoop one of the housefly-sized crustaceans on to the palm of my hand, and bring it to eye level. Now we are close enough to see the animal’s glistening exoskeleton, its shrimp-like legs, its body the colour of every grain of sand on the beach. For a few seconds the sand hopper lies there, motionless, like a dog half-curled by the fire. Then, with no perceptible movement at all, it vanishes, in a kinetic movement too quick for the human eye.‘They are creatures of the moon, burying themselves in the sand during daytime.’ Photograph: Tom AllanThat there are sand hoppers here on this beach tells us that it is healthy. It tells us the shoreline has not been zealously cleaned of seaweed in spring, removing the food the crustaceans depend on. Sand hoppers are also an indication that beaches are free from industrial pollution such as trace metals. They are sensitive to another growing anthropogenic threat, too: nocturnal light pollution. Artificial light, or “skyglow” has been found to interfere with the lunar radar sand hoppers use to navigate the shoreline at night, as they follow the ebb and flow of the tide. They are creatures of the moon, burying themselves in the sand during daytime, and emerging to feed after dark, when the beach is free both of predators and spade‑wielding toddlers.Will the creep of artificial light reach this Devon cove? At its back there is just a single farmhouse, set between two curtains of hillside, studded with wind-turned hawthorn trees. Getting here means navigating a mile-long potholed lane through a deep valley tangled with willow carr. I hope on this beach, at least, the sand hoppers will be free to continue to move with the moon, buried in the sand by day, there for anyone who pauses to notice them.

Whisky and peat go back a long way together. But is it time to put planet before palate?,"With a possible ban on industrial peat use in Scotland, some whisky makers are experimenting with other aromatics",['David Williams'],"The UK’s peat bogs are remarkable. Apart from their damp beauty, they are home to rare wildlife, act as a water filter and a ballast against flooding, and, perhaps most crucially of all, are a somewhat unsung hero of the battle with the climate crisis given their carbon-capturing power. Peat bogs are Scotland’s largest carbon store.That combination of attributes means peatlands have long been an environmental cause celebre, and explains why even this most part-time, pallidly green of governments has at last seen a reason to protect them, with the most high-profile piece of legislation so far being a ban on peat products for domestic gardeners, which will see composting products – already pretty much infra dig – entirely absent from garden centres by the end of 2024.It’s also why the scotch whisky industry is starting to feel a little nervous about how long its own relationship with peat can continue. Don’t forget, whisky and peat go back centuries together, a partnership which, for lovers of a peaty dram, is as precious and remarkable as anything else to do with peat: when barley is malted above a peat fire, it gives the resulting whisky that distinctive, damp-earthy-smoky flavour which many would argue is the quintessence of scotch.As well as making the point that whisky accounts for only about 1% of the UK’s peat use, defending the cultural significance of this tradition has been the central pillar of the scotch industry’s case during the Scottish government’s consultation on its peat policy this year. Pledges to make peat use more sustainable have also been part of the lobbying mix – although the idea that peat use can ever be truly sustainable given the glacial pace of regeneration (1mm a year) is a matter of some debate.Would an outright ban on industrial peat use in the short or medium term, which some producers fear may be the result of the consultation, spell the end of scotch as we know it?Dank, ancient and quite fantastic: Scotland’s peat bogs breathe againRead moreWell, apart from the fact that many whiskies have always have been “unpeated” (the elegant style of distilleries in Speyside, for example, that use unpeated barley), some makers have been experimenting with methods of replacing or reducing peat in their fuller-flavoured whiskies by using other aromatic fuels during kilning. These include juniper, birch bark, heather and alder wood. Some are even experimenting with biochar (a high carbon form of charcoal) and sheep dung, while others are using smokier, toastier barrels for ageing. None can ever quite replace the uniquely evocative hit of peat smoke. But between them they are likely to play an ever bigger role in shaping the flavours of whisky at a time when an increasing number of peat-lovers are looking to put planet before palate.Five unpeated whiskies and one with just ‘a little peat’Bruichladdich Classic Laddie Islay Single Malt Whisky (from £36, Morrisons, Tesco, Waitrose)The island of Islay in the Inner Hebrides is known for its uncompromisingly peaty-smoky whiskies. This stylish bottling, however, is entirely unpeated, but has a distinct whiff of the sea in gentle summer breeze mode along with a lemon-barley character which is fresh and subtly tangy.Bunnahabhain 12 Year Old Islay Single Malt Whisky(£46, bunnahabhain.com)Another unpeated style from the home of heavily peated whisky, Bunnahabhain’s 12 Year Old has a mouthwatering salty character running through it, and great complexity for the price, with maturation in sherry and bourbon casks bringing fruit and nut richness.Arran 10 Year Old Single Malt Whisky(£46.50, arranwhisky.com)From the eponymous isle, this is a delightful example of unpeated whisky in a creamily accessible style in which fruit loaf, apples and pears meet with a certain honeyed sweetness and a long, appetisingly savoury finish. Great with a slab of mature cheddar.Kyrö Wood Smoke Malt Rye Whisky(from £50, laithwaites.com; cambridgewine.com)Scotland isn’t the only place where peat is a concern for whisky producers: Scandinavia’s burgeoning scene is also looking at ways to go without, with the excellent Finnish distiller Kyrö here using the traditional alder-wood smoke to bring a nourishingly spicy, gently smoky dram.Fettercairn 12 Year Old Highland Single Malt Whisky(from £43.89, hedonism.co.uk; Selfridges; masterofmalt.com)This wonderful old distillery in the foothills of the Cairngorms makes unpeated whiskies of sumptuous tropical richness and compelling complexity, using, here, ex-bourbon barrels (other expressions use Scottish oak) for a mouthfillingly drinkable dram with a zesty-spicy finish.Glenmorangie A Tale of the Forest Whisky(from £69.95, masterofmalt.com; thewhiskyexchange.com)Glenmorangie’s latest release is a throwback to a Highland tradition of using a variety of different foraged “fuels” in its malt kilns: juniper, birch bark, heather, plus “a little peat”. The result is fascinating: flavours of crystallised orange and barley infused with subtle spice and herbal notes.",2023-12-12

Country diary: Up close with these veterans of the ocean,"Bardsey Island, Gwynedd: A night-time job gives us the chance to see not just the astonishing dark skies here, but also the huge numbers of Manx shearwaters",['Mya Bambrick'],"Two miles off the Llŷn peninsula in Wales lies Bardsey Island, an exposed, rocky landmass 1.5 miles long and just over 0.5 miles at its widest point. Bardsey mountain rises over almost half of the island, with a height of 167 metres and rare lichen species found at the top. It’s only reachable by boat and has just 12 properties, one being Bardsey Bird and Field Observatory – my home for the week.I’m here for a university birders week, and on a clear, mild and slightly windy night – a relief given how strong the wind can get here – we head out into the darkness to look for a rarely seen and fascinating species.As we walk along the gravel track, our gaze is fixed on the incredible night sky. There is so little light pollution here that the island was recently designated as Europe’s first dark sky sanctuary. Even the Milky Way is visible with the naked eye.The shores of Bardsey Island, a place nearly 30,000 manx shearwaters call home. Photograph: Picasa/Robert PowellDark silhouettes glide overhead, sounding like squeaky dog toys. As we wander towards a grassy stone wall, I see a black and white medium-sized bird sitting on the top. Then another, and another. These are Manx shearwaters, a seabird of the open ocean. Nearly 30,000 of these birds call Bardsey home, nesting in burrows and thriving due to the lack of ground predators.We are helping with a long-term scheme to ring and monitor these birds. Steve Stansfield, director of operations at the observatory, explains how to put on a metal ring, each with a unique number to help us to track and identify each individual. In autumn they will migrate to the South Atlantic, mostly off Brazil and Argentina, with the last juveniles leaving in late September or early October; they’ll arrive back here in late March next year. A Manx shearwater that nested on the island in 2008 was shown by its ring to be over 50 years old, and would have flown around 5m miles in its lifetime.These ones are adults; at night-time they like to sit on and around the walls near to their burrows. During the day, when we ring the juveniles, we have to put our hands down the burrows and carefully take them out.As I carefully attach the ring with Steve’s help, I think about all the phenomenal landscapes it has seen. Placing it back where it was found, I wish it good luck. Who knows – it might just make it to 50.

English councils have issued just three fines under tighter wood burner rules,"Data also shows only one prosecution and follow-ups on one-third of 10,000 complaints made since January 2022",['Helena Horton'],"There has been just one prosecution and three fines handed out for people using banned wood-burning stoves in England, data has revealed.Despite more than 10,000 complaints about wood being burned in populated areas since January 2022, local councils have not been enforcing the government’s “tough new restrictions” on stoves. Two-thirds of these complaints were not followed up, and only a handful led to any action.Urban areas with high particulate pollution face restrictions on burning wood, to avoid more particulates spewing into the air. Particle pollution is associated with increased mortality from causes including cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, as well as lung cancer.Dirty air causes 26,000 to 38,000 early deaths a year in England, and the particles are linked to many other health problems including dementia and depression. Wood burning has overtaken traffic in the UK as one of the most harmful sources of the smallest particles, known as PM2.5. Emissions of PM2.5 from wood burning increased by 35% between 2010 and 2020, the Times reported.In smoke-control areas, households can only burn unauthorised fuels, such as wood, on appliances that are rigorously tested to demonstrate low-smoke emissions. Fines of up to £300 and criminal prosecutions, which could result in fines of up to £5,000, can be brought under the Environment Act 2021.Only about 8% of people in the UK burn solid-fuels indoors, meaning a small minority are responsible for significant amounts of pollution. Two-thirds of these people live in urban areas, where the impact of air pollution is worst, and virtually all of them have other sources of heating.Research by the campaign group Mums for Lungs found 80 local authorities said they were not using the new powers, while 47 councils said the measures did not apply to them.In January, the government promised to introduce legislation after the publication of the environmental improvement plan (EIP) 2023 that would cut the emissions limit of wood burning stoves from 5g smoke an hour to 3g.The government then weakened its message in August, when the air quality strategy framework for local authority delivery rowed back on the EIP language, suggesting ministers would “look to strengthen” the effect of smoke-control areas, and consult on potentially reducing the limit.Jemima Hartshorn, founder of Mums for Lungs, said: “The government claims to have ‘world leading’ legal provisions to address air pollution but our research shows these are abjectly failing. Thousands of people are dying from respiratory illnesses and thousands of complaints are being made, but no action is being taken to clean up our air.

 This article is more than 7 months oldToxins hidden in plastics are the industry’s dirty secret – recycling is not the answerThis article is more than 7 months oldCharlotte Lloyd,We need to know more about what goes into plastics in the first place and better regulation of how recycled products are usedDr Charlotte Lloyd is a researcher in environmental chemistry at the University of Bristol,,"Sometimes it feels like we are simply drowning in plastic. Over the past five decades plastic products have found their way into almost every aspect of our daily lives. Global plastic production has reached a total of 8bn tonne – that’s 1 tonne for every person currently on the planet – with plastic pollution expected to triple by 2060.Current best estimates are that only about 10% of plastic ever produced has been recycled. Despite this, the idea of circular economy in the plastics industry is often cited as the magic bullet: we will simply reuse the plastic we have already made and reduce the impact of plastic pollution. But new evidence points to the flaws in this plan. A report by Greenpeace has found that recycled plastic can be even more toxic, and is no fix for pollution.Plastics cause wide-ranging health issues from cancer to birth defects, landmark study findsRead moreIt is now well known that plastic pollution is ubiquitous across the planet, with evidence of plastic particles being found in the deepest parts of the ocean, from the Mariana Trench to the peak of Mount Everest. There is justified concern about the impact of this pollution, both on ecosystems and human health. However, as an environmental chemist who has been studying plastic in the environment, I am increasingly concerned by a more hidden “invisible” threat posed by plastics: toxic chemicals.It is estimated that more than 13,000 different chemicals are involved in the production of plastics, and many of these have never been assessed for their toxicity. Chemicals are used alongside the plastic polymer itself to create the desired physical properties for different applications: how bendy or rigid you want your plastic, whether it needs to be fire-resistant or resilient to the effects of sunlight, not forgetting dyes and pigments used to give the product the desired colour.In food packaging or products designed for small children, there are stringent regulations of which chemicals can be included in order to reduce or mitigate the potential risk of exposure to toxins. However, this becomes problematic when you start to consider recycled plastics.Plastics collected for recycling will have been made for a variety of different uses (just think what might be in your household plastic recycling bin) and contain a wide range of chemicals used in their manufacture. If you add to the equation the fact that plastics very easily absorb substances that they come into contact with (containers for pesticides, household cleaning products etc), then you have the potential for a cocktail of chemicals, none of which will be removed by the recycling process.On top of this, studies have shown that other toxic chemicals can actually be produced during the physical process of recycling the material. As a result, these toxic chemicals can be transferred into products made from the recycled material, with evidence showing this includes food packaging and children’s toys.Many of the chemicals routinely found in plastics have endocrine-disrupting effects: they can interfere with the way our body’s hormones work. This can cause a range of health problems, including cancer risk and fertility problems. These chemicals also impact on our natural environment, for example affecting the reproductive health of river fish stocks. It would not be realistic to say that we should ban plastic production altogether (at least not in the short to medium term). Arguably, it makes sense to make some products from plastics where a lightweight, durable material is required. That said, substantially reducing our daily reliance on single-use plastics of course needs to be part of the solution.The most important thing is that we control the use of toxic chemicals needed to manufacture the plastics and the first step in doing this is knowing what is actually in the materials in the first place. This information is difficult to obtain because it is commercially sensitive, but I would argue that increased transparency in the industry is needed.I believe that recycling can also play an important role in solving the plastic crisis, but new regulation is needed to control the products that can be made out of recycled plastic where the impact of chemical risk is reduced, for instance putting it into construction materials or building foundations for new roads.The other key aspect to this problem is innovation – we need to design new ways of making these materials where both the polymers and the chemicals used are more sustainable and, most importantly, non-toxic. Where the use of toxic chemicals is unavoidable then there should be more stringent controls over the end-of-life processing, and they should only be used when absolutely necessary.The plastic problem is real and it is serious, but if scientists, industry, governments, and consumers all work together then we can overcome this crisis. We all have a crucial role to play.

 UK star count shows drop in light pollution under lockdown,Highest proportion of participants since 2013 saw 30 or more stars in Orion constellation,['Patrick Barkham'],"The number of stars visible in the skies above Britain increased in this year’s annual count, indicating a lessening of light pollution in lockdown.CPRE, the countryside charity, said 51% of people taking part in its citizen science count in February noted 10 or fewer stars in the Orion constellation, indicating severe light pollution. During the same period in 2020, before the first lockdown, 61% of counts registered 10 or fewer stars.Thirty or more stars, indicating truly dark skies, were seen by 5% of participants, the highest figure since 2013.“I’m delighted to see severe light pollution in the UK appears to have fallen,” said Crispin Truman, the CPRE chief executive. “It’s likely this is an unintended positive consequence of lockdown, as our night-time habits have changed. Let’s hope we can hold on to some of this achievement as we come out of lockdown.”The results, recorded on an interactive map, are published during International Dark Sky Week, which aims to raise awareness of the impact of light pollution. Human illumination of the planet is growing in range and intensity by about 2% a year, and light pollution is implicated in the decline of insects, especially moths, while also changing the behaviour of many other animal species.Truman said: “Looking up at a starry night sky is a magical sight and one that we believe everyone should be able to experience, wherever they live. And the great thing is, light pollution is one of the easiest kinds of pollution to reverse – by ensuring well-designed lighting is used only where and when needed, and that there is strong national and local government policy.”Let there be dark: the battle to save our sky from light pollutionRead moreRuskin Hartley, the executive director of the International Dark-Sky Association (IDA), said: “We believe that solving the problem of light pollution begins with knowing the problem exists. For many people, participating in Star Count during lockdown may, for the first time in a long while, have been their first encounter with a dark night sky.”CPRE and IDA are seeking to protect dark skies and lessen light pollution with policies to ensure lights are turned off in office buildings when they are unoccupied and increase the use of LED lights that only illuminate where we walk.",2021-04-06
,"With fewer than 2,000 Australasian bitterns left in the wild, the endangered bird relies on the wet rice fields to fledge their young

","['Supported by', 'About this content']","Rice farmers and ecologists in south-west New South Wales are weaving new partnerships between agriculture and wildlife conservation in efforts to rescue a little-known waterbird with a mysterious story.But pressure from the water market, crop competition and, ironically, increasing water efficiency, could pose a threat to their efforts.Third generation rice farmer Wayne Andreazza remembers when he first started hearing the foghorn-like call of the “bunyip” bird in the early mornings and evenings at his property in Griffith, NSW.“I didn’t really know what it was,” he said.“I’d be doing my watering and I’d hear this loud booming sound – it was amazing. I always wondered what it was.”Rice property owner Wayne Andreazza is working with scientists to protect waterbirds on his farm. Photograph: Mike Bowers/The GuardianAndreazza has been part of the Bitterns in Rice project for three years. The program’s aim is to ensure the survival of the Australasian bittern and is funded by the Riverina Local Land Services (LLS) through the National Landcare Program.“Male bitterns make deep, booming calls when searching for mates,” project ecologist Matt Herring said.“It’s believed Aboriginal Australians heard the calls and connected them to the myths of the bunyip, which is how it got the nickname.”00:00:27 Australasian bittern: Listen to the call of the 'bunyip' bird. Images of bitterns by Matt HerringThe mythical bunyip was said to lurk in swamps, marshlands and riverbeds waiting to pounce and eat wandering children or oblivious adults.There are differing stories of the origins of the bunyip. Some say it was a punisher of evil against the environment and wildlife. Others say it was a blood-thirsty killer.But the reports of the booming or roaring calls of the bunyip right before it would attack were most likely those of the stealthy bittern hiding in the grass.The Australasian bittern is found in the south-east and south-west of mainland Australia and Tasmania. Photograph: Mike Bowers/The GuardianWith fewer than 2000 birds left across Australia, New Zealand and parts of New Caledonia, about 750 of these endangered waterbirds call the rice fields of the Riverina home.Twelve years ago, with the help of Herring, farmers began to investigate how the elusive birds were using rice fields as nesting grounds to fledge their young.Herring began approaching individual farmers who were willing to make their land inviting for bitterns to nest.This meant conserving grassy banks for the birds to hide in, controlling predators and putting on early season permanent water.Ecologist Matt Herring uses drones with infrared technology to search for bittern nests on the rice farms. Photograph: Mike Bowers/The GuardianTraditionally farmed rice fields can mimic a wetland which suits the Australasian bittern. Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian“We developed an incentive program to bring together all the rice farmers who already had a rapport with the bitterns,” senior land services officer Anna Wilson said.“What we ask is a few simple things to do to tweak the environment to suit bitterns. The main thing is early permanent water, because without it the whole program falls apart. The bitterns need 140 days of water [a year].”While many rice growers have now moved away from permanent ponding to grow rice, Andreazza and his family continue to farm traditionally. In October they flood their rice with water for roughly five months to accommodate the bitterns nesting and fledging period.“You are basically mimicking a wetland,” he said. “We grow 1500 acres of rice and we do it on all the farms.”Thanks to farmer enthusiasm and good rains from La Niña, the past three years have been the most successful for the project to date, with 1885ha of land made available for bitterns to nest in the 2021-22 season.But Herring said while this is good news for bitterns now, external pressures on growers to transition to less water-intensive methods of farming threaten the long-term survival of the birds.It was twelve years ago that farmers started investigating how bitterns were using the rice fields as nesting grounds. Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian“Water-saving growing methods have an insufficient ponding period for the bitterns to breed successfully,” he said.“This is a real threat to the species.“We are doing everything we can to at least maintain some proportion of the rice area having early ponding … but to expect the entire rice growing area to farm in a bittern-friendly way now is unrealistic.“The water is worth just too much money and there is too much competition with cotton and almonds and other crops.”

Herring said the bitterns project is proof that agriculture and conservation can work together for mutual benefit, and people should be open to supporting it with their hip pocket.“In the long term, it’s the consumer that ought to pay for bittern-friendly rice,” he said.“I like the idea of the public voting with their spending. If we want to see conservation efforts in farming, we need to pay for it. People do it with coffee and tuna so why not the bittern?”Andreazza says the collaboration has not only been beneficial to the bitterns.“Every kind of duck and bird and frog comes in and it’s hard to put into words how it feels … Unless you experience it for yourself, it’s just unbelievable.”00:00:46NSW rice farmers save the Australasian bittern - video

Letters There’s no need for signposts in the hills,Frank Price and Steve Barr on the mystery of missing waymarks in Snowdonia,,"Re your report on the “mystery” of the missing waymarks (‘Phantom post snatcher’ on Snowdonia Slate Trail wrongfoots ramblers, 22 August), this is no mystery at all. Our upland areas are mere fragments of once much larger tracts of wild land rich in biodiversity. Many people visit and cherish these areas for their very wildness. The sight of marker posts relentlessly marching across moor and mountain, urbanising these precious spaces is anathema to many who go there. I didn’t do it, but if I had the chance I’d pull them out too.To those worried about poor souls getting lost in mist, the answer is simple: buy a map and learn how to use it. And visit your local mountain rescue website for more information on staying safe in hills. Frank Price Hilton, Cumbria I read with interest your piece about the phantom post snatcher of north Wales. May I suggest a possible solution to the mystery? Fifty years ago, I was visiting a friend who lived in an old huntsman’s cottage halfway up a Lakeland hillside and who knew the area like the back of his hand. We were tramping over the trackless high fells one day when I noticed him kicking over the small piles of stones that marked our route (if you looked carefully). This puzzled me, so I asked him what he was doing. I have never forgotten his reply: “Folk who need cairns to show them the way shouldn’t be up here in the first place.” Steve Barr Whittington, Staffordshire Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

His government imposed a national carbon tax and emerged victorious at the country’s top court after a handful of provinces challenged the constitutionality of the law.But in recent weeks, Trudeau undid years of careful messaging after he announced a temporary pause on the carbon levy for home heating oil.The decision has led to widespread criticism from provincial premiers who argue more exemptions are needed – and growing concern by economists and political analysts that the decision could eventually destroy the centrepiece of his government’s efforts to fight the climate crisis.How to make a carbon tax popular? Give the proceeds to the peopleRead moreLast month, Trudeau and a group of Liberals representing Atlantic Canada announced a three-year pause on the carbon price for home heating oil as a way of easing costs on lower-income Canadians. While the exemption is nationwide, the vast majority of heating oil is used in the Atlantic region by lower-income residents.He framed the exemption as a temporary relief to rising costs – and announced a series of plans to get residents off heating oil. But the decision has unexpectedly exposed the persistent challenges of carbon pricing for the government.Attempting to capitalize on the issue, federal Conservatives on Monday introduced a motion that would extend the home heating oil pause to all forms of home heating. The leftwing New Democratic party said it supported the motion, arguing the Liberal policy to remove the carbon price on oil heating is unfair to Canadians who live outside of the Atlantic region.“One of the big problems of a carbon tax is that people don’t really understand how it works and aren’t terribly convinced that this is going to make a big difference for the climate,” said Lori Turnbull, director of the school of public administration at Dalhousie University. With a nationwide affordability crisis and sagging poll numbers weighing on the incumbent Liberals, a decision to exempt a dirtier form of heating fuel has sent a confusing message to voters. “The narrative around it all just keeps getting worse and worse for the government.”Trudeau has since resisted any further carve-outs to the federal carbon price and defended the broader aim of the nationwide levy system, which he announced in 2019. Instead of adding more exemptions, Trudeau said his government will work with the provinces to further subsidize heat pumps for low-income residents, similar to what was announced in Atlantic Canada.Two miniature donkeys plod through snow while grazing near Cremona, Alberta, after the first snowfall of the season in October. Photograph: Jeff McIntosh/AP“The challenge for the government on this is that for years, they’ve been virtuous and so value-driven. They often suggest there’s no compromise. And so in this case, they’ve backed themselves into a corner,” said Turnbull. “Because it’s made people in other parts of the country – who don’t use heating oil but are still feeling the affordability crisis – even more angry.”Andrew McDougall, a professor of political science at the University of Toronto, said the decision “really undercuts” all of the arguments Trudeau has previously made about the revenue-neutral carbon tax, namely that climate is a serious issue in the country and he’s the only one ready to address it.“It makes him look like he either doesn’t actually care about fighting climate change and about a carbon tax, that it’s just a political move,” said McDougall.Recent polling suggests the Liberals have lost support nationally and while an election isn’t likely until 2025, Trudeau’s party faces a steep climb in its path to re-election.“By coming out and saying that he understands the carbon tax is creating hardships for people, he’s essentially reinforced the narrative of his opponents,” said McDougall. “It’s undone his messaging that the tax is not going to be something that’s going to leave you worse off. These last few weeks have been a gift to his political opponents.”The persistent controversy has buoyed political support for Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, who now holds a significant polling lead over the prime minister. The new Conservative leader hasn’t yet put out his own climate policy, but has so far run on a campaign to scrap the Liberal carbon tax.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And that’s true.”Tombe says he was “completely shocked and stunned” by the way the government undercut a message they’d worked hard to finesse.“By showing that they’re open to exemptions, it’s dramatically increased the pressure to expand the scale and scope of exemptions within the carbon pricing system,” said Tombe. “If heating oil creates an affordability challenge, then absolutely natural gas does as well. And for commuters, so too does gasoline.”One of the key benefits of the levy was that it sought to change behaviour through a predictable, escalating price on carbon.“But if now you have far less confidence that the carbon tax will actually be in the future, you’ve really weakened the incentive to make those decisions today. Heating oil is a small exemption, but we can also see the effectiveness of the entire carbon pricing system under pressure because it’s changing the way people think about it.”",2023-11-07
Two bald eagles nested in a pine for years. A utility company tried to chop it down,The fight to save the birds’ habitat ignites old frustrations over California’s engagement with tribal communities,"['Maanvi Singh', ' in Potter Valley, California', '@maanvissingh']","Up a winding northern California highway, beneath a 120ft ponderosa pine tree, a group of environmentalists gathered for some high stakes bird-watching.Everyone was waiting for a pair of bald eagles to swoop into their nest, an orb of twigs and branches balanced amid the tree’s scraggly branches. The elusive raptors have nested here for years, renovating and upgrading it each year in preparation for hatchlings in the spring.Deforestation piles pressure on South America’s elusive Chacoan peccary Read moreBut this year, unless the eagles – who spend the fall and winter months away from their nests – were observed back at their tree by mid-January, they’d lose it.That’s because Pacific Gas & Electric, the largest utility company in the US, had obtained a permit to chop down the ageing pine, arguing that it could fall on the company’s nearby power line and spark a catastrophic wildfire. Environmentalists and the Coyote Valley Band of Pomo Indians countered that PG&E – which is facing increasing pressure to stop its equipment from starting fires across the state – should move their power lines instead.Lawyers for the tribe beseeched the utility company to reconsider. Locals printed up signs to save the nest. In recent weeks, activists and tribal elders protested, prayed and physically barricaded themselves in front of the tree as PG&E crews came – alongside sheriff’s deputies – to cut it down.“They had their cherry picker and their wood chipper ready,” said Polly Girvin, an environmental and Indigenous rights activist. “But we weren’t going to back down.”Now, armed with binoculars and cell phones on a misty January morning, they were on watch. Bald eagles are protected under state and federal laws, and PG&E could only take down the tree so long as the nest was unoccupied or abandoned. “We need to keep proving that this is an active nest,” explained Girvin.Activists and tribal elders protecting the eagles’ nest. Photograph: Maanvi SinghThe eagles did come that day, arriving just as a thick rain began to roll in. A few days later, PG&E said it would back down.But the showdown over this lone tree, near an electrical line that serves just a single property, has raised difficult questions about PG&E’s approach to fire safety and its fraught relationship with the communities it serves, many of whom live in rural, wildland areas.The company is under growing legal and financial pressure to act after its power lines have been blamed for sparking multiple fires, including a deadly 2020 fire in northern Shasta county. Last year, it reached a $55m settlement with six counties over several other fires, including the Kincade fire and Dixie fire.As PG&E rushes to trim trees and remove brush near its power lines to avert future catastrophes – and avoid liability – environmentalists worry that local nuances are being overlooked.“PG&E says that the tree is dangerous, it’s a hazard – but that’s not right. It’s their lines that are the hazard,” said Naomi Wagner, a local activist with the environmental group Earth First!. “So why is it the tree that needs to go?”During their recent bald eagle watch party, Wagner, Girvin and half a dozen other activists settled around to a small campfire that fizzled in the rain. Old-time environmentalists who’d been agitating since the 1960s were joined by their kids, grandkids and dogs. Coffee, muffins and binoculars were passed all around, along with warnings not to squeal or shout to avoid startling the eagles.Priscilla Hunter, the former Coyote Valley chair squinted up and shifted closer to the fire. “It’s a miracle that they are here,” she said. Michael Hunter, the tribe’s current chair, jumped up. “Hey, birds, where are you at?”The bald eagles’ nest in the threatened pine tree. Photograph: Maanvi SinghActivists and tribal leaders, to whom the eagle holds cultural significance, have alleged that the power company and US Fish and Wildlife Service failed to properly inform and consult with the tribe in deciding to remove the tree, which could remain standing and serve as a habitat for this eagle couple, or their offspring, for years to come.And here was a bird that was not only sacred to Native American tribes, but also a symbol of the United States. And still, crews had come to take down the tree on 9 January – a day before National Save the Eagles Day. “I mean how clueless could PG&E be,” said Wagner.Moreover, the owner of the property where the tree stands, as well as the residents who live there, all supported alternative solutions – including rerouting or burying the electric line, or setting up a solar microgrid.In TV advertisements, PG&E has been promoting its plans to bury 10,000 miles of power lines underground to reduce the risk of them hitting trees, so why not do the same here? “I mean, come on,” Girvin said. “They just want to take the fast and easy route.”Ex-Arizona governor’s illegal makeshift border wall is torn down – but at what cost?Read moreMeanwhile, PG&E contended in public statements the tree “contains an inactive bald eagle’s nest, is a hazard and is at risk of failing and striking a PG&E line in a high fire-threat area”.Ultimately, the company was proven wrong when eagles finally swooped in. They first arrived as activists and tribal elders sang and prayed beneath the tree, hours before PG&E crews arrived. And they returned each day afterwards. “It was magical,” said Girvin.A few days later, PG&E issued a statement saying that it would bury the lines, after all. “This solution allows us to protect our hometowns while also taking into account the values of our local tribe, property owners and environmental advocates,” said Ron Richardson, vice-president of PG&E’s north coast region, in a statement to the Guardian.It was a hard-won concession – one that the activists will remain wary of until they receive a legally binding commitment to leave the tree standing. Though the company can’t take down a tree with nesting eagles, they could return if the eagles leave again. “It seems like you just have to expose how inefficient this is,” said Hunter, the Coyote Valley band chair.“It’s a miracle that they are here”: Priscilla Hunter, former chair of the Coyote Valley Band of Pomo Indians. Photograph: Maanvi SinghThis was already the second year that PG&E had tried to take down this tree. In 2022, as well, the eagle couple returned to their nest just in the nick of time to call off the saws. “And they had a baby!” said Joseph Seidell, a cannabis farmer who lives on the property and led early protests against PG&E’s plans. “I mean just look at this,” he gestured. “This giant pile of beautiful woven twigs holds this beautiful, sacred bird.”In August, the utility company de-energized the overhead electrical line, just in case the tree did end up falling and sparking a blaze, and asked for Seidell’s agreement that he wouldn’t impede crews when they came to take down the tree in the future. “It was devastating,” he said.The ordeal has left tribal leaders and environmentalists concerned that the utility company – and the government agencies that oversee and permit its fire safety plans – have failed to properly communicate and consult with communities before undertaking work that impacts important wilderness areas.Although the Fish and Wildlife Service had sent a letter informing Hunter of PG&E’s intention to cut down the tree in December, lawyers representing the tribe alleged that authorities didn’t wait for a response and didn’t give tribal authorities enough time to review the permit over the holiday season.The agency was unable respond to the Guardian’s request for comment before publication.The Fish and Wildlife Service, which has a codified “trust responsibility” – a binding moral obligation – to tribes, could do more to engage with and consult with tribal governments, said Don Hankins, a pyrogeographer and Plains Miwok fire expert at California State University, Chico.Michael Hunter, chair of the Coyote Valley Band of Pomo Indians, and Joseph Seidell. Photograph: Maanvi Singh“There clearly needs to be better coordination on these sorts of things,” he said. After a two-year fight over one tree, he noted, it’s unclear why government officials and PG&E didn’t coordinate with tribal leaders sooner.PG&E and the Fish and Wildlife Service do have policies to ensure that they don’t impact vulnerable species, Hankins said – but those laws and policies don’t always account for the complexities of specific environments.In Mendocino county, where there is a dark history of logging in the 1800s, which decimated old-growth redwoods and violently displaced some Native villages, a lack of proper communication and care by PG&E and the Fish and Wildlife Service brings an extra sting.And even now, the Coyote Valley Band of Pomo Indians are involved in a protracted fight to curb commercial logging in the nearby Jackson Demonstration state forest, a nearly 50,000-acre area managed by the California department of forestry and fire prevention, or Cal Fire.Cute, furry and key to the ecosystem: can sea otters save the US west coast?Read moreAnd although various government and private operators in this region have made some gestures toward working with local tribes with crucial, generational knowledge about the fragile landscapes here – they’ve often failed to meaningfully follow through, Girvin said.Crews for various agencies have operated “willy nilly for years”, she said. “They haven’t cared at all about putting skid trails through sacred sites, or thought carefully about habitat protection and the species affected in the area.” These incursions can feel especially frustrating when the government for decades ignored, denied and criminalised traditional stewardship practices of tribes up and down California, she noted.“To the settlers, whatever or whoever was in the way of doing business, they’d just cut down,” said Priscilla Hunter. “That’s what these eagles reminded me of.”",2023-02-04
AnalysisAlok Sharma is trying to save the world. Should he be able to fly to do it?Fiona Harvey Environment correspondent,Experts and campaigners defend UK minister in charge of Cop26 talks amid furore over diplomatic plane trips,,"The starkest warning yet on how close the global climate is to the point of no return will be delivered to the world on Monday morning, when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – made up of the world’s top climate scientists – publishes a landmark report.Details are still under wraps, but the Guardian has confirmed that the warning from the IPCC will reinforce how vital it is to try to prevent temperatures from reaching more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Beyond that threshold, scientists will warn, the consequences of extreme weather will be devastating. The world must act urgently: if greenhouse gas emissions are not halved in this decade, 1.5C of heating will be inevitable and probably irreversible.The IPCC’s warning will set the scene for Cop26 – vital UN climate talks – in Glasgow this November, where countries will be given a last chance to put the 2015 Paris agreement on track and hold global heating to within 1.5C.Plans of four G20 states are threat to global climate pledge, warn scientistsRead moreSo when it came to light on Friday that Alok Sharma, the UK minister in charge of the Cop26 talks, and his team – who are engaged in the urgent task of forging a global climate deal – had taken 30 flights as part of his diplomatic mission, it raised a critical question. Should Sharma be flying to these meetings, instead of conducting them virtually, at a time when we are increasingly aware of the impending disaster of climate change, and of the importance of reducing our carbon footprint?Sharma will act as president of Cop26, which means bringing together 196 countries that are signed up to the Paris accord and ensuring each of them comes up with a plan to cut emissions in the next decade, and agrees a long-term target of reaching net zero emissions around mid-century.That plan was always going to face serious obstacles: China, the world’s biggest emitter, is wedded to coal power and reluctant to make promises about phasing it out; India likewise is using coal to power its growing economy; Russia, Saudi Arabia and Australia are big fossil fuel exporters and have a history of trying to thwart agreement at UN climate meetings; Brazil under President Jair Bolsonaro is intent on allowing further exploitation of the Amazon rainforest, which is burning at near-record rates.On top of that, the Covid-19 pandemic has meant countries have been unable to meet as they usually would before a big climate conference. Key negotiations have been delayed and have had to take place virtually, but many countries have been concerned that virtual negotiations are unfair and will not produce the progress needed.Chris Venables, the policy director at the Green Alliance thinktank, said: “Alok Sharma is quite literally trying to save the world – and the idea that he shouldn’t use every tool at his disposal to try to do so is absurd. You can’t negotiate complex political planet-saving deals over Zoom and Covid has made it even more important for the Cop president to sit down with world leaders in person. This is a storm in a teacup – and for all our sakes, we should let him get on with job.”The Guardian view on getting to net zero: the crunch is coming | EditorialRead moreLeo Murray, a veteran campaigner on flying and co-founder of Plane Stupid, said: “The reason the Daily Mail has done this is to serve an agenda – they know it undermines the whole green agenda. He’s a diplomat – he needs to be flying. If there’s a limited budget for emissions from aeroplanes, this seems like a very good use of it.”Negotiations needed to take place in person if the progress required by November was to be made, pointed out Tom Burke, a government adviser and co-founder of the E3G environmental thinktank. He said: “The only way you can deal with climate change is if you can do successful diplomacy – and that can’t be done with Zoom, it has to be face-to-face. Alok Sharma has done a pretty good job. He has taken on this nightmare travel schedule because it’s the only way to do climate diplomacy.”Burke said the government’s rules allowed for exemptions from the need to self-isolate on return from overseas. “They allow for exemptions in an emergency – and boy, are we in an emergency!”",
 This article is more than 2 months oldFlood protection plans for English homes cut by 40%This article is more than 2 months old,"Quarter of new flood defence projects will also not go ahead, NAO finds, as Environment Agency blames cuts on inflation","['Helena Horton', ' Environment reporter']","The number of properties that will be better protected from flooding by 2027 has been cut by 40%, and 500 of 2,000 new flood defence projects have been abandoned, according to the National Audit Office (NAO).The number of homes forecast to be under enhanced flood protection by 2027 has been slashed from 336,000 to 200,000. This means 136,000 more homes will be at risk of flooding since plans were drawn up in 2020, figures from an NAO report show.Despite the government doubling its capital funding in England to £5.2bn to combat the danger of flooding, a quarter of new flood defence projects will now not go ahead. The Environment Agency (EA) has blamed inflation for the cuts in protection.Thousands of homes have been flooded during storms this autumn. Storm Babet was confirmed to have caused more than 2,000 homes to flood, while Storm Ciarán flooded more than 1,000. Storm Debi, which is causing havoc in Ireland, is expected to hit the west of England this week. Climate experts say storms are becoming more frequent and severe due to climate breakdown.The EA has added protection from floods to 59,000 properties in England since 2020. It had a target of protecting 336,000 homes by 2027.A shortfall in the agency’s finances means it cannot keep enough flood protections in the required condition to prevent destruction to homes. Due to inflation, the EA is £34m short of its expected budget, which means it will be be able to maintain only 94% to 95% of its assets at the required condition, resulting in 203,000 properties at increased risk of flooding. It had aimed to maintain 98% of its high-consequence assets at their required condition.The flood protection programme got off to a slow start. There was an underspend of £310m in its first two years, which has been deferred by the Treasury to make sure the government meets its target of spending £5.2bn on flood defences by 2027. Because of this underspend the EA will have to spend an average of almost £1bn each year over the remaining four years of the programme. There are fears from the NAO that these pressures will further erode value for money if hasty decisions are made to spend the funds.The NAO has also warned that the government has not set a long-term target for the level of flood resilience it expects to achieve and that there are no concrete plans beyond 2026 to meet long-term goals, meaning that long-term investment could be inefficient and not sufficiently protect enough homes from flooding.Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: “Government recognises the growing dangers from flooding and has committed to doubling its capital funding in England in the six years to 2027, as well as doing more to understand flood risk.“However, the capital funding is forecast to better protect only 60% of the properties that were promised when the programme was launched in 2020, while inflation and other programme risks mean the Environment Agency could deliver even fewer than that. If there are further delays to the capital programme, Defra must work with HM Treasury to make sure it is in a position to switch money quickly into maintenance, where this would provide value for money.“EA will have to manage a record level of capital investment in flood defences for the remaining four years of the programme. In doing so, it must resist pressure to accelerate projects or initiate new ones too quickly, if this is likely to lead to cost overruns and delays and put value for money at risk.”Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, said: “This report should be right at the top of new environment secretary Steve Barclay’s red box, laying bare the scale of ministers’ unforgivable neglect of this flooding crisis. Just weeks after huge numbers of homes were hit by devastating flooding, people are crying out for support and protection – yet this government has utterly failed to provide it. To add insult to injury, thousands more are expected to be unprotected from flooding risk in the years ahead.”A Defra spokesperson said: “The government’s priority is to make the difficult but necessary long-term decisions for the country. Over the last three years, we have invested more than £1.5bn to better protect more than 67,000 homes and businesses. This means that we have protected over 380,000 properties since 2015, and over 600,000 since 2010.“As has already been set out in the Environment Agency’s annual report, inflationary pressures and delays brought about by the pandemic mean we must look again at the targets set out in our £5.2bn programme. We will consider the National Audit Office’s recommendations as we continue to deliver our record investment to protect hundreds of thousands of homes from floods.”",2023-11-15
A new start after 60: I returned to my childhood home – and rediscovered a lost passion,"After winning a Bafta for his film work, Mark Frith felt the only way was down. Then he began to draw again, spending two months sketching a tree he had once played in. It was the start of a whole new career",['Paula Cocozza'],"Mark Frith was 57 when he won a Bafta for The Lie of the Land, a documentary about British farming released in 2007. He had been making films for 30 years. But shortly afterwards, he found himself feeling weary. “I thought, things can only go downhill from here.” Frith knew he needed to do something else – but what?A few years earlier he had bought his childhood home, which his mother had still been renting, and moved in with his wife, Emma, and two children for the final months of his mother’s life. The house, in Gloucestershire, looks out over the Severn vale.As a boy, he loved to sketch birds. “I was one of five sons to a single mum. We ran wild in the countryside and played like animals in the hedgerows.”The return to his childhood home stirred some unacknowledged yearning in him, because while Frith wondered aloud about a second career in landscape gardening, he heard a different internal voice. “That child who used to love drawing whispered to me down the years,” he says.Frith bought pencils and began to sketch – mostly friends’ children. It was the first time he had drawn since childhood. At art school, which he attended before film school, he was a conceptual artist, and drawing was “frowned upon as regressive”.Frith had an idea. There was a great oak tree at Nibley Green, a couple of fields from home. It had stood out to his young self as a “fantastical giant – a treasure trove, home to jackdaws, foxes, a barn owl, beetles, bats. It was a cave inside. We used to squeeze in through this hole.” He decided he would lock himself away for two months to draw it in all its glorious detail.Frith drew “every twig and every bud” on a large sheet of paper, 150cm by 130cm. “While I was drawing,” he says, “there came moments when it was as though the tree was drawing itself. I could feel the tree, I could smell the bark. I had spent so much time playing in that tree, it was deep inside me. And it emerged in this drawing.”His finished oak held “a real power”, he says. “As you walk towards it, it just grows. The detail emerges.”A friend suggested he approach Felix Dennis, arts patron and lover of trees. “I found out he was doing a poetry reading in Stratford-on-Avon,” Frith says. “I staggered into his dressing room with this great big drawing, plonked it down in front of him and said: ‘Mr Dennis, I want to draw these oak trees.’ I knew the tree would talk. ‘Right,’ he said, ‘You better come and see me.’”Felix Dennis in 2006. Photograph: Karen Robinson/The ObserverAt lunch a few weeks later, they talked for hours, drank three bottles of wine, and finally Dennis wrote a contract on a piece of paper that he rolled and stuffed inside one of the empty bottles. It was for 20 drawings of “the most important oak trees in Britain”. He would pay Frith “regularly and handsomely”. At 60, Frith had become a tree portraitist.Over the next three winters he travelled the length and breadth of Britain and spent days with each of the trees, selected with the help of the Ancient Tree Forum, the Tree Council, the Woodland Trust and “other ancient tree nuts”.In 2014 – the year Dennis died – Frith completed the project. The resultant collection was exhibited at Kew in 2018, Dennis having donated half the drawings before he died.Frith has since started work on a 20-drawing series of Britain’s most important ash trees. Against the backdrop of ash dieback, the project feels urgent. “These beautiful old ash trees are going to be lost to us,” he says. “They are 350 years old and they are dying because of a disease that we’ve spread.”Drawing is not only an act of care and a demand for preservation, but it “gives me that interface between my passion for the natural world and my creativity,” Frith says. It has also given him a different perspective on the passage of time. “I’m an old man yet I’m only 71, and some of the trees I’ve drawn are 1,000 years old. When I’m with them and when I draw them, I think about my mortality and the brief nature of human life that passes fleetingly beneath them.”

 Dolphins hit by Deepwater Horizon spill at risk from new drilling and river plan,Up to 45% of Barataria Bay’s dolphins died after 2010. Now they face the threat of new drilling and a Mississippi River scheme,"['Seascape: the state of our oceans is supported by', 'About this content', 'Kurt F de Swaaf']","Nearly 80% of dolphins exposed to oil in the Deepwater Horizon disaster remain badly affected nearly 12 years later, according to new research, even as the Biden administration continues to approve leases for oil and gas drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.Scientists looked at the long-term impact of the oil spill on bottlenose dolphins living in Barataria Bay, near New Orleans.The lagoon off the Louisiana coast was heavily polluted by oil, which killed scores of dolphins directly or within months, and their population is now slightly over half of what it was.Pelicans nesting in Barataria Bay after the 2010 disaster, which halved the dolphin population.  Photograph: Gerald Herbert/APThe surviving dolphins did not escape ill effects, however, according to the peer-reviewed study in Conservation Biology. Lung disease has been the most common issue, according to Lori Schwacke, an epidemiologist of the National Marine Mammal Foundation who was the study’s lead author.Other deterioration in the dolphins’ health has led Schwacke to believe the dolphins may be suffering from an illness similar to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a progressive lung condition. Age-related effects could also play a role.Recent surveys suggest Barataria Bay’s bottlenose dolphin population has diminished by up to 45% since the disaster, to approximately 2,000. The reproductive success of the remaining females was significantly reduced.Those dolphins born after the spill do not show signs of health impairment, however. “The hope is that, over time, the young animals will take over the population,” said Schwacke. Recovery to baseline numbers will probably take about 35 years, she estimated, providing there are no severe threats in the near future.A dead dolphin washed ashore five years after the oil spill.  Photograph: Cain Burdeau/APLast November, however, the US government leased huge parts of the Gulf of Mexico’s seabed for oil and gas drilling. Although the deals were recently annulled in court, there could be an appeal against the decision, making the possibility of another oil spill a strong possibility.Moreover, a plan to divert large amounts of water and sediment from the Mississippi River into Barataria Bay poses an even greater risk. The aim of the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, which is behind the work, is to restore coastal ecosystems such as intertidal marshes and to enhance flood protection, with the project set to start next year.But the influx of freshwater will lower the lagoon’s salinity to concentrations of less than 5 parts in a thousand. This is expected to kill dolphins, said Schwacke. Low salinity triggers severe physiological reactions, causing their skin to develop lesions and become inflamed before killing them.‘It’s outrageous’: Trinidadian fishers film ‘half-hearted’ oil spill clean-upRead moreThe federal National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted that about a third of the population will be lost each year as a result of the project.Schwacke said the dolphins were unlikely to move to avoid the impact of the Mississippi project. “These animals have high site fidelity,” she said, adding that if the sediment diversion scheme proceeds, the dolphin population would almost certainly be wiped out.",2022-02-28
 Cop27 is here and the climate crisis is daunting but here’s the key to tackling it – cheer up Isabel Losada,We environmentalists must avoid sending the message that the situation is hopeless. Let’s focus on solutions,,"My dear fellow environmentalists,With the Cop27 summit about to be begin, can we please think about how we talk about the climate crisis? The scale of it is there to see – it can’t be missed – but haven’t we read enough books and attended enough events where we are told, once again, about the historic causes of the problem, the intransigent complexity of the problem and the inevitable worsening of the problem? Given a little more time, I swear that most speakers would detail the length, depth and height of the problem. It is depressing. It doesn’t help. Please stop.I sit at these events – pen and notebook in hand – listening for solutions. Not long ago, I sat through a talk about biodiversity loss. At the end of it, a member of the audience, who was obviously feeling as frustrated as I was, asked rather desperately, “But what can we do?” “Conversation,” the speaker suggested. I didn’t write this down.I know that the problem is serious; I’ve read (most of) the IPCC report, and listened to the podcasts – all reminding me that this is an emergency. But don’t most people know this now? It is beginning to feel as if we are running around shouting, “Smoking is bad for you!” We know. Gloom and hopelessness are not great motivators and too many environmentalists have almost given up. People are so relieved when I tell them I have a pragmatic, life-enriching approach.Call me a misguided optimist, but I believe that the changes we make can, and are, making a difference. So if you are giving a talk or writing about the environment, don’t waste the opportunity to give people specific actions they can each take. Here are some:Be a little bit activistClimate activists in London in June 2022.

You don’t have to glue yourself to the road if you don’t want to. But find a form of activism that works for you. One person told me: “I loved sitting in the summer sunshine at Balcombe during the anti-fracking campaign.” And of course – they won eventually. There is no fracking in Sussex. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak – who is finally, reluctantly, heading to Cop27 – says no fracking on his watch.Personally, I love drumming with a samba band if there is some environmental action going on. Everyone loves the band. One year, even the police got into trouble for dancing. So don’t do nothing. Just find activism that you enjoy.We do need to be radical. We need to change the way that we live – in every way. It’s about living lives that are designed to support the Earth. And it can be done in ways that enhance our lives too. Life is short and we have a planet to save.Leave your high street bankTriodos Bank is one of two main funders of the Hoprigshiels community windfarm.

But because of the energy crisis everyone has to stay where they are for a while. So what can we do about the outrageous profits and moral bankruptcy of the energy companies? Don’t use their energy.If you can afford to, it is time to install solar panels. If you can’t do this, fill your kettle from a mug: we use a lot of energy in our homes overfilling our kettles and boiling them nine times a day. Switch everything off. Use hot-water bottles. Hang heavy curtains in winter and if you really want to be radical – learn about the health benefits of cold showers. Seriously. They are exhilarating. They wake you up.

" Achoo! Sea sponges sneeze to clear their pores, marine experts say","Study suggests waste disposal system of the creatures, which look like little chimneys, is more complex than thought","['Nicola Davis', ' Science correspondent', '@NicolaKSDavis']","Birds do it, reptiles do it, and humans do it with an almighty “achoo!” – now it has emerged that sponges can also sneeze, casting off accumulations of particles trapped in mucus on their surface in the process.The team behind the research said that while the aquatic organisms had previously been observed making contractions, which they had dubbed “sneezes”, the details of the process remained unclear.Now they have found the contractions are involved in an unexpected form of waste disposal.Dr Jasper de Goeij, a marine biologist at the University of Amsterdam and the senior author of the paper, said the team made their discovery while examining timelapse videos of sponges in a bid to understand how the creatures poo.“We found a lot of the [ejected] material … to be probably inorganic particles, meaning sand, sediment, things that the sponge cannot use that are only maybe clogging the system and it needs to get rid of,” De Goeij said.Sponges are a little like chimneys, in that they have long been thought to operate a one-way system. Water, containing nutrients, enters the organism through tiny pores and is filtered, with excess water and waste materials discharged into a central cavity from which they are expelled through a single opening, called the osculum.But the latest study suggests there is another waste disposal system at play.Writing in the journal Current Biology, De Goeij and colleagues reported how they found the Caribbean stovepipe sponge, Aplysina archeri, has a constant stream of mucus flowing out of its pores against the feeding current – not unlike a runny nose – carrying particles with it.The team say this mucus forms highways across the sponge, intercepting and moving particles on the surface in the process, resulting in the formation of stringy clumps. When the sponge sneezes, this particle-rich mucus is ejected into the surroundings.“That’s something we have never seen before,” said Prof Sally Leys, a sponge expert at the University of Alberta and co-author of the research.What’s more, the team said this mucus-rich material is subsequently fed upon by other creatures.“There’s many critters that probably would crave a bit of sponge snot,” said De Goeij.Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BSTThe authors suggested particles need to be cleared out of the creature’s pores and off its surface to prevent its filtration system from becoming clogged.“There must be some evolutionary advantage to not having all these bits and pieces go into the [organisms’ pores],” said Leys, suggesting one potential explanation is that they may damage the filtering cells of the sponge.However, questions remain, including what exactly triggers a sponge to sneeze, how the mucus is moved, and how widespread the phenomenon is among sponges.While a sponge sneeze is different to a human sternutation, not least as sponges filter water rather than air and their sneezes take about half an hour, Leys said there are parallels, as both involve uncontrolled contractions to expel waste.“What’s really interesting is it’s sort of an evolutionary basic,” said Leys.Discovered in the deep: meet Casper the ghostly octopusRead moreLeys added that the study offered fresh insights into what may appear to be a simple creature.“It is a very sensitive and coordinated animal, despite not having all the characteristics that you’ve grown up to understand animals should have – fronts and backs, and eyes and tails and things like that,” she said. “It’s constantly behaving in a way that we can relate to.”",2022-08-11
LettersThe Wight way to have a great British holiday after giving up flying,"Virginia Orrey says the Isle of Wight has everything you need for a break, from beautiful beaches to renowned restaurants. Plus a letter from Cathy Swann",['Letters'],"I agreed wholeheartedly with Chitra Ramaswamy’s thoughtful article on embracing the need to give up flying away on holiday (Now, more than ever, I understand the need to get away from it all – so why don’t I miss flying?, 1 June).

Country diary: A downed pheasant draws quite the scavenging party,"Sandy, Bedfordshire: Red kites, crows, buzzards and magpies fight it out over a carcass that looks like the Christmas turkey after Boxing Day","['Derek Niemann', '@DerekNiemann']","An unequal dogfight is taking place over open country at the foot of the ridge. In these midair tussles between a red kite and a carrion crow, the heavyweight never wins. The kite offers no defence against its light, agile opponent, behaving as if it were an unresisting pin cushion. The twisting crow harries the kite persistently, jabbing at wings, back and tail. Eventually, the battered bird tires of its beating and turns with the wind in its wings to be borne well away. And then it comes back.The grass track we follow is on a gentle curve, so there comes a reveal when a kite appears on the path ahead, stood in the middle with its back to me, leaning forward. A crow flies down, dive-bombing, trying to dislodge it. This is not the same kite as before – now hanging low immediately over us – nor is it the same crow. What is the attraction that has drawn four intelligent and highly observant birds to prize this spot?All kites and crows have cleared away by the time we catch up with a halo of body feathers in cinnamon, chestnut and black. A cock pheasant lying in the centre of this feather drift looks immaculate, but for the fact that his breast has been plucked and pulled open, showing bright, pig-pink flesh. Over the last few weeks, we have seen dead swans and geese strewn around the local lakes and rivers, all most likely victims of bird flu. Has this bird succumbed too, or was it shot?Carrion crows dive bomb opponents as they scavenge for food. Photograph: Tim Grist Photography/Getty ImagesWe continue our there-and-back walk. By the time we return about 20 minutes later, others have joined the scavenging party. A buzzard affects a low glide, before settling in a tree to weigh up its chances. A magpie crosses the path right to left, left to right. When we draw close, the birds scatter. The downed pheasant now looks like the Christmas turkey after Boxing Day, ribs prised apart and a flat plate of bone, its keeled sternum, completely stripped of meat.

 Courier-Mail columnist Peter Gleeson weathers scandal as more plagiarism revealedAmanda Meade,Journalist apologises for ‘unintentional’ lifting of material from political analysis written by Josh Bavas and is revealed to have copied Queensland parliament factsheet. Plus: Quillette charges US$150 for New Orleans social,,"In an opinion piece in March, the Courier-Mail columnist Peter Gleeson – who apologised this week for plagiarising another journalist’s work – filled 62% of his article with copy from a Queensland parliament factsheet.In his Gleeso Confidential column, the former editor of the Sunday Mail used hundreds of words from the official document without quotation marks, Weekly Beast can reveal.Peter Gleeson’s Courier-Mail column: the words in red are taken directly from the factsheet“The Queensland Parliament is unique among Australian state parliaments as it is unicameral, that is, it only has one chamber,” he wrote without attribution.“Unicameral legislatures are uncommon in Westminster parliamentary democracies.“The standard parliamentary model in Westminster democracies includes two chambers consisting of a lower house and an upper house of review.”The article then goes on to copy 21 further paragraphs from the factsheet.We asked Gleeson for comment on this cut and paste job but he did not respond.The revelation comes after Gleeson was caught lifting four paragraphs of political analysis by the Brisbane reporter Josh Bavas, who wrote his piece for the ABC in 2020 when the deputy premier Jackie Trad stood down from cabinet.Gleeson’s feature formed part of a 12-page “Special Investigation by Peter Gleeson” in the Saturday paper headlined “Power and Palaszczuk”. It was a hit job on the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk.When we earlier asked the “Andrew Bolt of Queensland” if he would resign over that scandal, he said simply “nope”. Doubtless someone with fewer connections than the Sky News host and former Murdoch editor of several mastheads would have been out the door.ABC notifies police over racist email sent to sports presenter Tony Armstrong Read moreAfter Bavas posted his article side-by-side on Twitter with Gleeson’s article, Courier-Mail staff demanded to know what their editor, Chris Jones, was going to do about the plagiarism.Why does today's Courier Mail analysis on Premier Palaszczuk by Peter Gleeson contain word for word chunks from my analysis for ABC News on Jackie Trad's departure more than two years ago? pic.twitter.com/FwsCnOnUwP— Josh Bavas (@JoshBavas) October 28, 2022
Jones told them he was taking it seriously and posted an uncharacteristically frank note for a News Corp editor on the offending online article: “Editor’s note: A previous version of this story included four paragraphs which were not the author’s work. News Corporation’s Code of Conduct states that ‘plagiarism is theft’. The Courier-Mail apologises for this error.”Both Jones and Gleeson called Bavas to apologise.Weekly Beast understands the candid admission of “theft” by Jones angered Gleeson’s Sky News boss, Paul Whittaker, who wasn’t consulted before the note was published.On Thursday the Courier-Mail published a page-four apology from Gleeson in which he claimed the plagiarism was “unintentional”.Rebel Wilson: Australian Press Council condemns SMH column on same-sex relationshipRead more“I deeply regret the fact that material written by another journalist appeared under my byline in The Courier-Mail last Saturday,” he said. “This was not a deliberate act by me to use another person’s work and present it as my own.“I had archived this particular material – written by Josh Bavas – as part of research for my investigation report into how power really operates in Queensland today.“The error to include it in my report was unintentional and happened under the pressures of deadline. However, I recognise the seriousness of plagiarism even if it is unintentional.”State of playThere is a “clear and obvious gap in the ABC’s news coverage”, according to the ABC’s former editorial director Alan Sunderland, who left Aunty in 2019. In an essay for ABC Alumni, Sunderland says coverage of state and territory issues has been lacking since the ABC abolished the state-based 7.30 programs in 2014. He argues that the ABC is not providing the depth of coverage of all levels of government that we need and says the lack of state coverage is “driven more by budget necessity than editorial judgement” because state-based programming is expensive.Unsurprisingly, Sunderland’s view is rejected by the corporation’s news director, Justin Stevens, who says the ABC is doing more comprehensive state-based journalism than it ever has, and digital platforms mean the content has a far bigger audience than it did when it was confined to a 30-minute weekly TV program. Stevens says the state reporters are breaking more stories than ever before, and cited many examples including Josh Robertson and Mark Willacy’s investigations into Star Casino Brisbane, which led to Queensland’s attorney general ordering a fresh investigation.Oz reporters rewardedThe MEAA Northern Territory media awards has joined Murdoch’s News awards in recognising the Australian’s Kristin Shorten, Matt Cunningham and Claire Harvey for their coverage of the acquittal of the Northern Territory police officer Zachary Rolfe over the 2019 shooting of Kumanjayi Walker in Yuendumu.Q+A moves back to Monday nights, ending speculation it might be axed | Weekly BeastRead moreJudges of the Walkley event appear not to have been bothered by criticism from Indigenous journalists of the Australian’s coverage.

Attendees have been assured no riff-raff will be allowed into the mansion: “This will be the fourth Quillette Social we’ve run (prior parties took place in Toronto, London, and Sydney) and rest assured that security will be provided so that only those on our guest list will be admitted.”ABC reprimandedThe media watchdog has slapped the ABC for a breach of privacy for identifying a man’s profile on a dating app.The Australian Communications and Media Authority said the May 2021 segment included footage of a screen scrolling through a dating app showing the profile of a person, including an image of a face, age and first name.“All of this is clearly visible, used without any consent whatsoever on my behalf and has gone on to create significant stress and issues in my life as I’ve not been on a dating app in over three years,” the complainant told Acma.The ABC rejected the finding, saying casual viewers would not be able to identify the complainant.But Acma’s chair, Nerida O’Loughlin, found it was a breach of the ABC’s code of practice: “Media intrusion into a person’s private life without consent must be justified to be in the public interest.”Planting seedsAfter weeks of flashy program launches from Seven, Nine and Ten heavily featuring big budget reality and dating shows – The Real Love Boat anyone? – it was a welcome relief to attend SBS’s upfronts this week and hear about a diverse and rich slate of content including a documentary from Jess Hill examining consent.

 The Treasury missed a green trick when it handed out Covid cashPhillip Inman,Commitments to a greener and healthier environment would have been a reasonable price to ask,,"When the government reacted to the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 with unprecedented rescue funds, ministers were urged to attach strings before the money disappeared out the door.The strings would have forced employers to adopt policies they had resisted for years, most obviously cutting carbon emissions and promoting a healthier environment.An obvious target of a Treasury financial rescue mission that also sought to achieve such goals would have been the oil, coal and gas industries.However, the UK’s finance ministry was clear from the moment it began dishing out grants and cheap loans that there was not time to draw up schemes that could successfully direct firms to do the right thing.A report by the development charity Tearfund, the International Institute for Sustainable Development and the Overseas Development Institute shows the impact of the Treasury’s failure, and of other country’s finance ministries, to extract commitments to be greener from the worst offenders.The new analysis reveals the G7 countries, which meet next week in Cornwall to discuss among other things how quickly they can stop an irreversible climate catastrophe, committed $189bn (£133bn) to support oil, coal and gas between January 2020 and March 2021. In comparison the G7 – the UK, US, Canada, Italy, France, Germany and Japan – spent $147bn on clean forms of energy.As Tearfund argues, the contrast in cash terms is bad enough, and is made worse by politicians who yet again missed an opportunity to speed up the transition to net zero with some rules governing what polluting businesses must do to cut emissions.BP’s purchase of solar farms in the US is a shuffling of existing assets from one owner to another. The commitment needed from BP and other oil majors should be to promote the renewable sources of energy that must become the foundation stone of their businesses.To find out more on this subject, a book by former Guardian energy editor Terry Macalister and James Marriott, Crude Britannia, gives the background to a long history of lobbying that has kept most governments from attaching strings to much of the oil and gas industry’s upstream activities.Before the pandemic, one gold star for the Treasury was the absence of support for the coal industry. But now a new mine in Cumbria, backed by an Australian investment firm and planning to sell mostly outside the UK, is potentially in line for significant subsidies.One solution is a shift inside the Treasury to measuring progress using a broader metric than GDP, which only looks at the spending and income generated by businesses, households and government.Adair Turner, the chair of the Energy Transitions Commission, who acted as first chair of the Climate Change Committee from 2008 and was previously head of the Confederation of British Industry, said last month the Treasury had the power to make or break a net zero roadmap.Prof Sir Partha Dasgupta, the Cambridge University economist who recently completed a review for Rishi Sunak on the economic importance of nature, said the world’s governments must ditch GDP and use an accounting method that includes the depletion of natural resources.If the impact on the environment was taken into consideration, subsidies would always take into account the impact on the environment. Maybe next time they will.Depop off to the USIt may be a matter of regret that the tech entrepreneur Simon Beckerman has joined the long list of successful UK-based business people to sell out to a US mega corporation, but it should come as no surprise.Beckerman has sold the Depop secondhand clothes selling app he founded for the £1bn target the London resident set himself when he established the business a decade ago.Such is the high level of strategic financial planning adopted by Beckerman in the preparation for a sale, it would get more than a nod of approval from the Dragons’ Den judges.Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDeskLast year he told GQ magazine that to reach his goal of a £1bn price tag he might need to go through six or seven private equity fund raisings, and at the last count it was six.The benefit to the UK, as so often these days, is not that ownership stays onshore, but the jobs do. Think of the ARM computer chip maker that will stay in Cambridge, but is in the process of being sold to a US firm. When so many businesses follow this trend, it must be something ministers should worry about.",2021-06-02
 This article is more than 5 months oldExtreme weather: the climate crisis in four chartsThis article is more than 5 months old,"As much of the northern hemisphere endures blistering heatwaves and parts of Asia are deluged with rain, a number of climate records are being challenged",['Josh Nicholas'],"The climate crisis is moving into uncharted territory as much of the northern hemisphere endures a blistering heatwave, many countries are deluged with rain, sea surface temperatures reach new heights, and Antarctic sea ice new lows. A number of climate records – some unofficial – have tumbled in recent weeks.Many factors have combined for this to happen, including climate change but also the El Niño weather event, and the northern hemisphere summer.00:03:10What is supercharging the global heat? – video explainer“The northern hemisphere has a lot more land, it means this time of year just tends to be hotter globally than in southern hemisphere’s summer,” says Dr Kim Reid from Monash University.“And so this combination of this background warming from global warming, El Niño and the fact that it’s the hottest time of the year for the globe means that we’re just seeing all these records tumbling, all at once.”While the UN’s World Meteorological Organization and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have both declared a Niño is in place, Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology has so far held back from declaring one, saying the atmosphere is not yet giving the typical signals.This heatwave is a climate omen. But it’s not too late to change course | Michael E Mann and Susan Joy HassolRead moreThe record for global average temperature has been broken a couple of times in the past few weeks, according to a model of average air temperatures at two metres, created by the NOAA. Although, as this data is derived from a model and not direct observation, it is not an “official” climate record.The model is based on observational data from weather stations, balloons, satellites and other sources and allows climate scientists to get an idea of the temperature over a wider area and create an average for the entire globe.The chart above shows the global average derived from the model, but maps also show the positive temperature anomalies – the difference between current temperatures and the long-run average – spread across much of the Earth’s surface in June.High temperatures were recorded across much of the world in JuneEven as the air temperatures have been elevated, the NOAA models show sea surface temperatures are also higher than in recent decades. Monthly data shows that the temperature anomaly has been positive and on an upward trend for decades.The ocean stores a lot of the excess heat from global heating – up to 90% in recent decades.“Because we’ve had La Niña the last few years, a lot of the heat has gone into the ocean,” Reid says. “It’s sort of been hidden from us at the surface for a bit. And now as we’ve flipped from La Niña into El Niño, a lot of this ocean heat is now rising up to the surface.”chartWhile the air and sea surface are seeing greater than average heat, new records are being set for sea ice in Antarctica – for how little there is. The lack of sea ice extent is continuing a trend – a new record has been set several times over the past few years.Satellite data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center shows that not only is 2023 a significant outlier, 2022 ended with some of the lowest sea ice extents on record. But the gap to the long-run average for this time of year appears to be getting larger.”But Reid warns that the Earth – the climate – is a complex system, with many moving parts. What is happening to sea ice in Antarctica, for instance, also has to do with winds, storms and pressure systems.“We’ve got, of course, the background climate change, we’ve got the seasonality, the fact that it’s summer, the fact that it’s now El Niño, and then there’s also what we call effects from aerosols. So these are tiny particles like sulphur dust, sea salt, that can reflect incoming solar radiation. And [all this] can control the planet’s temperature.”",2023-08-03
‘We need something real’: the Russian climate activist taking on Putin’s war ,"As Russia seeks to strip Arshak Makichyan of his citizenship, he says negotiating with Putin on the Ukraine war or the climate crisis is impossible – and the west must act now for survival","['Andrew Roth', ', Moscow correspondent']","Arshak Makichyan made a name for himself as Russia’s ‘lone climate activist’, protesting for change in a country where oil and gas exports have propped up the country’s economy for decades.Every Friday, for nearly two years, Makichyan protested alone in Moscow’s Pushkin Square, hoping to draw Russian attention to the danger posed by climate change. Born in Armenia, but given Russian citizenship when he was 10, Makichyan graduated from a prestigious music conservatory and turned to activism after reading about climate change and Greta Thunberg’s weekly strikes. “I was representing Russia as a violinist on competitions, and I was organising Friday for Futures, so I had a feeling that I am a future of Russia,” he said.Now the Russian government wants to punish him by taking away his passport.In a court hearing this week, Russia will seek to revoke Makichyan’s citizenship, in a move that he and his lawyers call unprecedented, and a threat to millions of foreign-born Russians willing to speak out against the war.“Even though I was born in Armenia, I am part of Russian culture, I love Russia, I was fighting for Russia for years, I was risking my freedom for years,” said the activist in an interview over the phone on his 28th birthday last week. “And now I don’t know what to do.”In his first interview about the case, Makichyan, who left Russia with his wife, Polina, in late March, and is currently living in Germany, told the Guardian he felt that the Russian claim was revenge for his anti-war and climate activism. Most recently, he has lobbied European politicians for a fossil fuel ban that could deprive Vladimir Putin’s regime of its key source of revenues.Russia has regularly expelled foreign activists from the country. But stripping a Russian citizen of his nationality would be a rare move as the country sinks deeper into isolation and totalitarianism since launching its war in Ukraine. If Russia succeeds, Makichyan told the Guardian he would be left stateless.“I was inspired by [Alexei] Navalny because he returned to Russia although it was very dangerous,” said Makichyan. “I was planning to go back to Russia with my wife to continue to fight against this war. But now most likely we cannot go back to Russia any more.”The impact of climate change is being felt more and more strongly in Russia, which has been hit by growing forest fires in Siberia and melting permafrost and growing desertification in Russia’s south. But it remains a niche concern for most of the country.Before the war, Russia’s tiny handful of eco-activists used to believe they could lobby the government for real policy change, even as the Kremlin failed to meet its obligations under the Paris agreement on greenhouse gas emissions and continued to profit from exports of fossil fuels.But the war has changed everything. According to Makichyan it has shown that it is impossible to negotiate with Putin. He adds that he could “not pretend like it’s normal and continue talking about 2050 when millions of people are suffering now”.“I was connecting the dots between the human rights crisis and climate crisis,” he said. “Of course this war was a red line for a lot of people. That’s why I am calling Putin a war criminal and a killer. Because before the war I was thinking that maybe it’s better not to be that harsh on him. But now I think it’s a moral obligation to tell things as they are.”The climate activist was arrested in Moscow in late February for speaking out against the war, and his wife had been arrested several times for staging protests. “I didn’t want to leave the country but my wife was saying that she wants to breathe free air and it was actually unbearable for us,” he said. “Because we were expecting searches almost every day. Likely we would have been arrested if we had stayed in Russia one or two more days.”At one point, he and his wife even swapped clothing for a Pussy Riot-style escape from a police stakeout at her parents’ flat. Polina dressed up as Makichyan, a floppy-haired, rail-thin activist who would still fit in on most college campuses. She walked straight past police before a friend drove her out of the neighbourhood.They decided to marry this winter so that if they were arrested, they would have the right to see each other in prison. Their wedding day, 24 February, turned out to be the same day that Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine. Makichyan wore a white shirt bearing the words “Fuck the war” in blood-red lettering.For years, he said, Russia has been using the topic of climate change to promote its own interests, like its nuclear energy programme, while “marginalising and ignoring” activists in Russia like Makichyan who were calling for significant cuts in emissions.“It was different for us to be climate activists because we were trying to fight for everything,” he said. “Climate is everything and there is no climate education in Russia so we were trying to build it up from the ground.”Now outside Russia, he said they were shocked by the indifference that many Europeans were showing toward the war.“I think the west can do much better than they are doing now,” he said, saying that he had been in Germany for two months and politicians had declined to meet him.“They don’t understand how it is crucial now to act,” he said. “We need something real. Of course if we have embargo on Russian fossil fuels it will influence life in Europe, there will be some economical consequences.“But this war is something bigger, it’s not about economy, it’s about survival. If we won’t change Putin’s regime then I don’t know how we can have new climate negotiations.”",2022-06-06
" Climate crisis could wipe 1% a year off UK economy by 2045, say ministers","Global heating of 2C would cause billions in damage each year by 2050, according to risk assessment","['Fiona Harvey', ' Environment correspondent']","The climate crisis will wipe at least 1% a year off the UK’s economy by 2045 if global temperatures are allowed to rise by 2C, the government has said.More action would be needed on key areas such as flood defences, restoring natural protections such as peatlands and wetlands, and making the built environment more resilient to extreme weather, ministers said.The government’s third five-yearly assessment of the risks from climate change was published on Monday. While taking what many regarded as a conservative estimate of future risks, the assessment painted a future of drastic disruption and costly impacts from the climate crisis.Damage to the UK’s food production, and to infrastructure, from extreme weather, and the risks of flooding, are all likely to cost more than £1bn a year each. In all, at least eight areas of risk were judged likely to cost more than £1bn a year by 2050 – however, some may cost much more, as the risks were assessed in bands, with more than £1bn the highest available.Many other potential areas of risk, such as risks to business supply chains and to the delivery of health services, and the potential damage to culturally important heritage sites, were judged unable to be fully assessed.Jo Churchill, the minister for climate adaptation, said: “The scale and severity of the challenge posed by climate change means we cannot tackle it overnight, and although we’ve made good progress in recent years there is clearly much more that we need to do. By recognising the further progress that needs to be made, we’re committing to significantly increasing our efforts and setting a path towards the third national adaptation programme, which will set ambitious and robust policies to make sure we are resilient to climate change into the future.”Green campaigners said the predictions showed the government needed to do far more to prepare for the effects of the climate crisis. Doug Parr, policy director at Greenpeace UK, said: “This report makes clear that even modest increases in global temperature will have profound impacts across every aspect of our lives. Adaptation can no longer be an afterthought, action on climate change of all kinds needs to be right at the heart of government policy and programmes.”The costs of cutting greenhouse gas emissions – a renewed focus of political attention, as some backbench Tory MPs have called the net zero target into question amid energy price rises – also looked modest in comparison with the cost of the impacts of climate breakdown, according to analysts. Matt Williams, climate and land programme lead at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: “The damage caused to the UK by climate change will be greater than the investments needed to avoid harmful levels of warming.”Signe Norberg, of the Aldersgate Group of businesses supporting sustainability, said: “Investing in a healthier natural environment is key to making the UK more resilient to the impacts of climate change and it will be critical that the government puts forward ambitious and credible targets under the Environment Act as well as a new and comprehensive environmental improvement plan later this year. The UK must also continue its efforts to deliver rapid emission reductions across the economy and beyond just the power sector. Key policy gaps remain in crucial areas, such as energy efficiency, agriculture and land use, and skills.”Labour said the government had failed to reduce emissions and to prepare the country’s infrastructure for the impacts of the climate crisis. Jim McMahon, the shadow environment secretary, said: “After more than a decade in power the Conservatives have failed to build the efficient homes, strengthened flood defences, and resilient natural habitats necessary to tackle the climate crisis. Their lack of action and empty promises are putting people, nature, and our economy at risk.”The government said it was investing £5.2bn to build 2,000 new flood defences by 2027, and increasing the nature for climate fund on peat restoration, woodland creation and management to more than £750m by 2025.",2022-01-17
 How to spot the difference between a real climate policy and greenwashing guffDamian Carrington,"Unless actions by governments and corporations cut emissions in the here and now, a dose of scepticism is in order",,"So it’s goodbye climate deniers, hello – and you’ll pardon me for being blunt here – climate bullshitters.The impacts of the climate emergency are now so obvious, only the truly deluded still deny them. Instead, we are at the point where everyone agrees something must be done, but many are making only vague, distant promises of ineffective action. As a result, we are currently on track for a 0.5% cut in global emissions from 2010 levels by 2030, when a 45% drop is needed to avoid climate catastrophe.So how to spot this greenwash? A good rule of thumb is whether the proposal actually cuts emissions, by a significant amount, and soon, and whether the proposer is in fact making the climate emergency worse elsewhere.Let’s start at the top, with the world’s governments, which have been setting out more targets than an archery competition. The global leader is the UK, which recently pledged a world-beating emissions cut of 78% by 2035. Targets are a necessary first step, but need action to be met and the instant, universal response: “Show me the policies!”The problem is some actual UK policies are pushing emissions up, not down: massive road building, a scrapped home energy efficiency programme and slashed electric car incentives, new oil and gas exploration, a failure to halt airport expansions and block a new coalmine (instead, the government belatedly ordered a public inquiry).But it is not just Boris Johnson’s government that says one thing while doing another. All are talking tough on climate, but China is building one large coal-fired power station a week, Japan remains one of the biggest financiers of overseas coal plants and Norway is developing giant new oil and gas fields.Canada’s premier Justin Trudeau says climate change is an “existential threat”, yet the country’s emissions have actually increased since the 2015 Paris deal, thanks to its tar sands exploitation. Oh, and many nations still subsidise fossil fuels, which is like buying more cigarettes when you’re trying to quit smoking.The world’s forests are suffering because of the same doublespeak. Indonesia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Peru and Colombia all pledged in 2014 to end deforestation by 2030. Yet in official carbon-cutting pledges submitted to the UN since then, none have confirmed that commitment.Companies are, if anything, even better bullshitters than governments, and the fossil fuel giants are masters. Many are still exploring for new reserves, when we already have more than can ever be safely burned.Chevron touts capturing CO2 emissions and storing them underground as a solution – one that of course enables the continued burning of its products. But its plans for carbon capture and storage cover less than 1% of its 2019 carbon emissions. ExxonMobil wants public money to help with its carbon capture project to store 50m tonnes of CO2 by 2030. That’s just 8% of the 2020 emissions its products resulted in.Another technological fix promoted is hydrogen, in theory a clean fuel when generated using renewable energy. But its most enthusiastic backers are incumbent fossil fuel companies. Members of the global Hydrogen Council include Saudi Aramco, BP and Total, while the UK parliament’s hydrogen group is funded by Shell and gas network and boiler-making firms.Why? Because hydrogen is a way for oil companies to move towards green energy without giving up fossil fuels. Pierre-Etienne Franc, co-secretary of the Hydrogen Council until 2020, explained: “It’s a way to avoid having stranded assets from the current fossil fuel-based system.”Heating homes currently produces 14% of UK carbon emissions and finding a green alternative is a major challenge. But hydrogen is a “very poor solution”, says one clean energy expert, Michael Liebreich, and should only be considered for heavy industry, and perhaps aviation and shipping, sectors where using electricity directly or via batteries is near impossible.SSE is one of the UK’s biggest electricity suppliers and a “major partner” of the crucial UN Cop26 climate summit that the UK is hosting. It is also the only company currently building a new gas power plant in the UK. Then there is Drax, which receives huge subsidies for burning wood in its power station. It insists this is climate-friendly – many scientists and environmentalists disagree.Drax proposes in future to add carbon-capture capability to its wood-burning power station, suggesting this would mean CO2 was being removed from the atmosphere, via trees and plants. But to work on the global scale some envisage, this approach would require an estimated 0.4 to 1.2bn hectares of land – 25% to 80% of the cropland that currently feeds the world. WWF and other NGOs recently walked out on the European Commission after the bloc’s “disastrous” decision to label bioenergy as sustainable.Next up, big banks – their financing of fossil fuels was bigger in 2020 than in 2016 or 2017, after the Paris climate deal. Top of the pile is JPMorgan Chase, despite it launching a “Paris-aligned financing strategy” and “aiming to finance and facilitate” $1tn in green initiatives by 2030.Barclays and BNP Paribas both became founding members of the UN-backed Net-Zero Banking Alliance last month, yet both are in the top 10 financiers of fossil fuels since 2015. Over at BlackRock, the world’s biggest investor and a company that says climate change is a “global threat”, its “Carbon Transition Readiness” fund includes Chevron, ExxonMobil and other fossil fuel giants.Now let’s turn to carbon offsets, which many companies proffer as a way to claim future climate neutrality. An alarm bell should already be ringing when long-term climate-change sceptic Nigel Farage is getting into the offset business.Offsets sound good in theory, but too often are fantasy accounting. Planting trees is a popular idea, but even if every possible new tree on the planet took root and started sucking up carbon, they would still be overwhelmed by fossil fuel emissions.Shell is keen on offsets – 120m tonnes by 2030 – while Nestlé’s goal of offsetting 13m tonnes of CO2 a year with “nature-based solutions” would require 4.4m hectares of land a year, according to NGO Grain – about the size of Denmark. Still, KitKats will be carbon neutral by 2025, the company says, so that’s nice.Even UN climate finance envoy and former Bank of England governor Mark Carney recently tripped up over offsets. He claimed that the investment company he vice-chairs was “net zero” despite investing in fossil fuels because the company also invested in renewable energy. Some called that an “accounting trick”. I call it a pile of rubbish.Aviation companies are also prime purveyors of green guff. Ryanair boasted before the pandemic that its CO2 per passenger kilometre was the lowest in Europe, neglecting to mention that its growth in passengers meant its total emissions were rising.London City is among the many airports claiming to be carbon neutral – actual flights not included. And British Airways’ owner has just pledged to powering 10% of its flights with sustainable aviation fuel by 2030, a date by which the world must halve emissions. Meanwhile, the UK is set to cut taxes on domestic flights – contrast that with France, which is banning short internal flights.Perhaps the worst transport offender is the shipping industry. In November 2020, the International Maritime Organization, which says it is “contributing to the global fight against climate change” sealed a deal that allows emissions to increase until 2030.I could talk next about the giant meat companies – such as the one promising to end its deforestation, but not for 14 years – or the motor or tech industries, but I think you’ve got the picture by now.So what to make of it all? Don’t think there is no real climate action: renewable energy and electric cars are accelerating rapidly. And companies’ pledges can sometimes be impressive, for example Burger King committing to less meat and more plants in the patties it serves up.But until every government and corporate decision has to pass the bullshit test – does it really cut carbon now – then we are kidding ourselves if we think we are treating the climate crisis like the emergency it is.

" Canada: Indigenous people fished sustainably for 1,000 years before settlers arrived – study","New research shows Tsleil-Waututh practices were destroyed during European colonization, and in recent decades wild salmon populations have collapsed","['Leyland Cecco', ' in Toronto']","A First Nations community on Canada’s west coast practiced the sustainable harvest of wild salmon for 1,000 years, before the system was largely destroyed after the arrival of European settlers, a new study has concluded.The Tsleil-Waututh, an Indigenous community whose traditional territory has been subsumed by the city of Vancouver, were long known to have used large weirs to capture salmon preparing to spawn.New research published on Wednesday shows that the Tsleil-Waututh used sex selection when harvesting spawning salmon, releasing the females to ensure the population would remain healthy for future use.Archaeologists studied chum salmon bones dating from between 400 BC and AD 1200 from four archeological sites around the Burrard Inlet.In their research, the authors of the study discovered that salmon bones taken from former village sites were overwhelmingly male, instead of an even mix with females.“People were harvesting the same sort of fish consistently, probably from the same places, for 1,000 years,” said Jesse Morin, archeologist for the Tsleil-Waututh Nation and an adjunct professor at the University of British Columbia, to the Canadian Press. “Here we are, 150 years later, 150 years’ worth of industrial harvesting, and we’ve really destroyed these resources.”Large weirs were likely placed in the inlet and then hauled ashore, where community members could select male salmon and set the females free.“If you take a good number of the males out of the system, the remaining males can still mate with the females to no detriment to the population,” he said. “One male can mate with 10 females and have just as many baby salmon the next year.”The Tsleil-Waututh weirs were torn down during European colonization, said Morin.In recent decades, wild salmon populations have collapsed.'We're sounding the alarm': half of Canada's chinook salmon endangeredRead moreHalf of Canada’s mighty Chinook, many of which spawn in the region, are considered endangered. All other species of Pacific salmon are in precarious decline. By some estimates, in just 100 years, 75% of sockeye have been wiped out.The crash of salmon – exacerbated by overfishing, poor watershed management and a changing climate – has significant effects on the region’s ecosystems. The endangered southern resident killer whale relies on healthy Chinook salmon populations, as do grizzly bears in coastal regions.The Tsleil-Waututh practices highlight the importance of properly managing a fishery as governments scramble to find a way to save the troubled salmon populations. In recent years, members of the Nation have not fished on their traditional territory, despite a treaty right to do so, in order to help rebuild ailing stocks.",
 This article is more than 1 month oldAd industry grapples with role selling consumption in climate crisisThis article is more than 1 month old,Does being an effective agency mean helping sell more products or can it mean helping mitigate climate emergency?,"['Amy Westervelt', '@amywestervelt']","When Bartle Bogle Hegarty won one of the advertising industry’s most coveted prizes – the Effectiveness award – for their amazing car-selling prowess, two executives from another company worked out that the resultant carbon emissions of the extra 132,700 Audis that BBH had managed to shift came to about 5.2m tonnes, roughly equivalent to the annual CO2 emissions of Uganda.The work has been a lightning rod in an industry that is deeply divided over its role in the climate crisis. There is increasing agreement that although individual behaviour should not be the primary focus for change, some individuals’ behaviour – namely that of the world’s wealthiest people – has a much bigger impact not only on global emissions but also on broader economic and political trends. But how should the advertising and PR industries grapple with the overconsumption of the top 10%?After all, advertising drives consumption – a fact of which the industry is intensely proud. The UK’s Advertising Association likes to brag that every pound spent on advertising returns six pounds to GDP. The US Advertising Coalition finds that every dollar of ad spend drives about $21 in sales.“The fundamental question is: is the advertising industry going to help or hinder society in its attempt to reach net zero?” said Jonathan Wise, a co-founder of the nonprofit group Purpose Disruptors, which aims to shift the industry away from high-consumption advertising. “At the moment, on balance of evidence, the decision is to hinder. It’s advertising driving consumption upward.”The industry disputes this. “Our research shows the goal of most advertising is to help brands, products, and services grow sales at the expense of their competitors,” a spokesperson for the Advertising Association said. “This leads to substitution rather than increased consumption overall.”Unsurprisingly, the sector knows the importance of sending out encouraging messages about the work they are doing. In 2020 the Advertising Association, along with the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising and the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers created Ad Net Zero, and billed it as the global advertising industry’s response to climate change. The action plan, however, focuses primarily on reducing the emissions of agencies’ own operations as opposed to those associated with the products they sell.There has been a push within the industry to get advertising to shift towards more sustainable products, for example electric vehicles rather than combustion engine cars, or plant-based foods as opposed to beef. This is seen by the industry as one of the critical ways they can have an impact, and such shifts do deliver reductions in emissions. But Wise worries that simply replacing emissions-intensive consumption with a lower-emissions version isn’t enough to decarbonise the economy.And while a handful of agencies are looking to sell greener options, the actions of the industry as a whole seem to show a resistance to considering such things as their responsibility. The transportation sector, identified as probably the most significant area of consumption for the top 10% by Julia Steinberger, a professor of ecological economics at the University of Lausanne and the author of a 2020 paper on the topic, is a good example. “The categories of consumption that the wealthiest people overconsume or overspend on and that constitute the big difference in their emissions is really flying longer distances, and driving bigger cars longer distances, so transportation is really the big one,” Steinberger said.View image in fullscreenA Lotus Evija electric sports car at a fair in China. Photograph: VCG/Getty ImagesData on ad spend from the data service Media Radar shows that advertisers in those categories drive that precise overconsumption. US automakers are spending at least twice as much to push their largest models of electric vehicles – SUVs, trucks and sedans that require extra large batteries, or in some cases two batteries – versus more compact options that would reduce the need for not only rare earth minerals but also steel, iron and plastic.In some cases the chasm between what is spent to push larger versus smaller EVs is even larger. From October 2022 to October 2023, General Motors spent more than $96m (£76m) to advertise its electric Hummer and Blazer models (not including agency creative fees). It spent just over $5m to advertise its compact Bolt option over the same time period. Ford spent $61.2m (£48.7m) to advertise its electric F150 , and around $9m to advertise its mid-size electric Mustang. Among the top automotive advertisers, only BMW and Hyundai are spending as much or more to market their more efficient EVs.Similar trends are evident in the air travel industry. More than half of Delta Air Lines’ approximately $151m ad spend from October 2022 to October 2023, for example, was spent advertising long-haul flights, encouraging travellers to rack up air miles to use for more travel, and pushing upgrades to premium classes, although the airline also spent tens of millions of dollars to advertise its commitment to “sustainable aviation fuels”.Qatar Airways, meanwhile, directed more than 85% of its advertising spend during the same year into marketing business class and long-haul flights exclusively.Short-haul flights are not necessarily environmentally preferable, particularly flights that could be replaced by a rail trip; they emit more carbon dioxide per kilometre than long-haul flights, making them more carbon intensive. However, long-haul flights emit more in total; they account for only 6% of total flights, yet are responsible for 51% of air travel emissions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

She points out, pragmatically, that the current situation is not surprising: “The highest carbon behaviours and products get the most advertising because they’ve got the biggest margins.” In short, big cars make big money for their makers, and for their advertisers.Another part of the problem, according to Townsend, is that ostentation is desirable. “All throughout human history and all throughout the animal kingdom, wasteful overconsumption is used as a signal of desirability of a mate,” she said, citing a peacock’s feathers as a good example. “And so one of the things which marketers who know this very well can do is to kind of go: how can we make sustainable products that look ostentatious?”But Wise is not sure that green consumerism is an answer. “At some point, we have to have a conversation about the relationship between the client, the agency helping them sell their product or maintain their share price, and our responsibility to the British people.”The Advertising Association says its industry has a role to play in enabling and encouraging the sort of behaviour change necessary to create a decarbonised society. “Advertising makes a valuable contribution to the social and cultural fabric, not just the economy, and has a crucial role in public messaging.”In the end, the decision may be taken elsewhere, because the amount of stuff people need to be satisfied in their lives is going down, according to Steinberger. “The empirical evidence is very, very strong and it shows that human development indicators, life satisfaction indicators, all of these things do saturate at a moderate level of income, at a moderate level of energy use, and not only that, but those income and energy levels are actually dropping over time.” This article was amended on 21 November 2023.

There are also flood warnings in Exeter, Sidmouth and Cullompton, according to the Environment Agency.Devon and Somerset fire service said it had deployed teams to support local people. It also asked local residents to avoid driving through floodwater, and for those who come into contact with it to decontaminate their bodies and clothing.The BBC reported that the village hall in north Cadbury was opened to residents on Tuesday night, and that about 18 households were thought to have been forced to evacuate.James Watts, the chairman of the village hall, told the BBC that the area had been cut off. “The water reached 4ft (122cm) in parts. The Parish Road end of the village is not as deep but there’s a torrent that is going across the road. It’s quite fierce,” he said.In Devon, the River Otter burst its banks, while Wilden All Saints school in Worcestershire was evacuated after it was hit by lightning. Tipton St John primary school and Woodbury Salterton primary school, both near Exeter, were affected by storms, Devon and Somerset fire and rescue service added.Hertfordshire constabulary tweeted on Tuesday night that it was experiencing a high volume of 999 emergency calls involving cars being stuck in flooded roads across Hertfordshire, in particular the eastern boroughs, following the afternoon’s downpour.Devon county council added that there were problems in Exeter “due to flooding and stuck vehicles”.Chilterns Railways reported cancellations and hour-long delays, while Greater Anglia cancelled services between Cambridge and King’s Lynn due to severe weather.Rescue services are asking anyone in an emergency situation involving floodwater to ring 999.An Environment Agency spokesperson said heavy thundery showers had resulted in “surface water flooding of several properties in parts of East Devon and Somerset overnight”. It is monitoring river levels and checking flood defences.He added: “Showers have been forecast for the next two days but as a precaution we urge residents to sign up for flood warnings and continue to monitor the weather reports.

Fossil fuels v our future: young Montanans wage historic climate fight,Sixteen young people are suing the state of Montana in what will be the first youth-led climate case to make it to trial,"['Supported by', 'About this content', 'Ray Levy Uyeda']","When Grace Gibson-Snyder was 13, she launched an independent project in her home town of Missoula, Montana, to encourage restaurants not to use single-use plastic containers. She found that youth activism enabled her to press the adults in her life to take the climate crisis seriously. Even if she was too young to vote, she could still be heard.Three years later Gibson-Snyder upped the ante by teaming up with 15 other young people on a novel approach to climate activism: to sue the state of Montana for failing to protect their generation from irreversible harm brought by the climate crisis.IPCC: We can tackle climate change if big oil gets out of the wayRead moreTheir case, Held v State of Montana, argues that state lawmakers have prioritized the business interests of the fossil fuel industry over their future. When their case is heard next February, it will be the first in a wave of youth-led climate lawsuits to successfully go to trial. Experts say a decision in favor of the 16 youth plaintiffs could have sweeping implications across the country, setting guard rails for how politicians are able to protect the interests of extractive corporations.“The world is literally burning all around them, and nothing’s being done about it,” said Nate Bellinger, a senior staff attorney with Our Children’s Trust, the non-profit law firm that is representing the youth plaintiffs. “Not only is the state not doing enough, but the state is continuing to affirmatively promote the fossil fuel industry and development.”The 16 young people, who were between the ages of two and 18 when they filed the lawsuit in March 2020, have already felt the impacts of climate change, from dangerous air quality brought by wildfires to the extreme drought that jeopardizes some of their family-owned cattle ranches. As these environmental consequences mount, young people have emerged as a leading force in the climate activism movement.In Montana in particular, the young activists face a political system that is deeply entrenched with the fossil fuel industry. Policy experts say Montana officials have shaped state laws around the financial interests of the energy companies, even while the science on the worsening consequences of climate change has been available and widely circulated.The most notable change occurred in 2011, when the legislature made it easier for fossil fuel companies to increase drilling and prevented agencies from considering how future extraction projects would contribute to climate change. The move essentially hamstrung future climate legislation by placing a gag rule on questions related to environmental impact. That same year Montana withdrew from the Western Climate Initiative, an agreement between western states and parts of Canada to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Anne Hedges, the director of policy and legislative affairs at the Montana Environmental Information Center, says that over the past 20 years the state legislature has undercut any progress that might have been made toward exploring renewable or non-extractive energy options.“[Legislators] just don’t want anything to compete with coal,” she said. “The majority is committed to continuing down the path of burning coal.”A freight train transports coal in Hardin, Montana. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesWith six coalmines and four private coal plants, Montana is the sixth-largest coal producer in the US. It also has four petroleum refineries and is one of the largest consumers of oil and gas in the United States. Since 2003, Montana has received nearly $650m in disbursements from oil and gas extraction on mostly public lands, making it the eighth highest total in the country.Hedges is adamant that the contributions from fossil fuel corporations don’t just pad the campaign coffers of elected officials – they keep them in power. Over the past 20 years, oil and gas campaign contributions have totaled nearly $450,000. But members of the legislature are not the only ones assisting fossil fuel corporations despite increasingly dire climate change impacts, such as drought, shorter winter seasons and increased air pollution.For instance, in 2020 the Montana Public Service Commission, the agency tasked with supervising public utilities and pipelines, was found to have undermined smaller solar projects in the state by favoring NorthWestern energy, the state’s primary energy utility company. “I call them out of control,” Hedges says. “They are only interested in building new gas plants and holding on to the Colstrip plant [in south-east Montana] for ever.”One of the largest recipients of fossil fuel contributions is Steve Fitzpatrick, a representative from Great Falls, who pushed through contracts to keep power plants open in previous legislative sessions. Another is Barry Usher, a Republican representative from Billings, who sponsored legislation to extend funding to the state coal board and lower the tax rate of coal companies over the objections of local governments, Hedges said.Then there’s Duane Ankney, a Republican senator from Colstrip, a town of 2,500 people located in south-east Montana, who helped construct the Rosebud coalmine in the 1980s. Ankney has passed dozens of bills that offer financial and regulatory benefits to the fossil fuel extraction industry, Hedges says, even attempting to eliminate the board of environmental review in a 2017 bill that was ultimately vetoed.The legislature also approves the governor’s nominee to the state oil and gas board. “They’re there to rubber-stamp what the industry requests,” Hedges says. The voices of constituents who live near or recreate in an area slated for extraction are ignored, she adds. “It really has been limited to just people who have a financial interest in oil and gas who are allowed to be on that board.”The oil and gas industry is particularly adept at recognizing who their allies will be in state legislatures, says Matthew Goldberg, an associate research scientist at the Yale program on climate change communication at Yale University. Goldberg has studied how oil and gas corporations motivate legislators to vote against the environment, and says that fossil fuel extraction companies do not necessarily look to persuade legislators with campaign contributions and lobbying funds, but to reinforce policy positions that harm the environment.“If this is a recurring cycle, where they’re being, in a sense, rewarded for their anti-environmental votes, then you can see how that can pile up where there’s this creation of an incentive to do so over and over across election cycles,” Goldberg said.The young people hoping to break that cycle in Montana are part of a larger youth-led movement seeking to untangle the fossil fuel industry’s grip on local and state government. But so far, activists have seen uneven success. At least 17 Republican attorneys general, including Montana’s, have attempted to block an earlier and ongoing youth climate lawsuit, Juliana v United States, saying that the economic implications of a finding in favor of the plaintiffs would jeopardize state economies. The Juliana case, which was filed in 2015, may head to trial next year if a federal judge finds that the young people have legal standing.Kelsey Juliana, a lead plaintiff in Juliana v United States, speaks outside the supreme court in Washington in 2019.

","['Paul Karp', '@Paul_Karp']","The Albanese government has ripped at least $9bn of regional, environmental and infrastructure spending out of the federal budget, much of it linked to Scott Morrison’s bid to win Nationals’ support for net zero.The cuts reverse some of the Morrison government’s most controversial spending, from pre-2019 election commitments including the urban congestion fund, the Hells Gate Dam and regional funds established by the Coalition’s last budget in March.In this explainer we break down some of the budget’s biggest savings and identify which projects will miss out.Six graphs that explain the 2022 federal budget: rosy views mugged by reality | Greg JerichoRead moreInfrastructureThe single largest saving in the budget is $4.7bn over four years for “building a better future through considered infrastructure investment”.This includes a cut of $769m from the urban congestion fund, including a $160m saving from the controversial commuter car park fund, which the auditor general found was used to fund Coalition election commitments.If you’re hoping to park and ride at MacArthur or East Hills on the T8 line, or Hurstville in New South Wales; or Bentleigh, Ferntree Gully or Hampton in Victoria then there is bad news: the budget axes the commuter car parks promised for these suburbs.Other cuts from the Coalition’s infrastructure investment program include upgrades to the Wakehurst Parkway in NSW and Dorset Road in Victoria.The government has also “reprofiled” the funding of existing projects, meaning the projects will still be built but over a longer timeframe, with $6.5bn of infrastructure spending pushed out of the forward estimates (the next four years) into the medium term.The budget papers explain this was done “to better align investment with construction market conditions”.Although this measure is a net $4.7bn saving, the government is also spending in the infrastructure portfolio, including:
$2.6bn for Victoria, including $2.2bn for the Suburban Rail Loop East
$2.1bn for Queensland, including $866m for the Bruce Highway
$1.4bn for NSW, including $500m for the early planning for Sydney-to-Newcastle rail
RegionsThe budget shows a $1.4bn saving for “responsible investment to grow our regions”.The energy security and regional development plan will be slashed by $6.4bn. Just $672.7m of spending remains from that program, which will be spent over seven years to help the Pilbara in Western Australia, the Hunter in NSW and central Queensland to support emerging industries and economic transition. The Northern Territory is now off the list.This is a budget of no surprises – designed to be sober, to build trust in the hope of better things to come | Katharine MurphyRead moreThe regional accelerator program, which the Coalition set up in the March budget promising $2.1bn for regional manufacturing and industry development, has also been gutted, with $1.8bn cut.

The community development grant program has been axed, saving $802m, while the building better regions fund is also gone, saving $256m. In their place, the Albanese government is promising $1bn over three years for the growing regions program and regional precincts and partnerships program – which it says will be “competitive” grants programs.But not all grants programs will be open and competitive: Labor will spend $1bn over five years for the priority community infrastructure program, including $120m to deliver the central Australia plan; and $350m over five years to deliver small-scale community, sport and infrastructure projects. Both of these are “closed grants program to deliver the government’s election commitments”.Labor will also give a $1.9bn equity injection to the Middle Arm sustainable development precinct in the Northern Territory.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

$5.4bn saved by not proceeding with the Hells Gate Dam project in Queensland
$900m of funding over four years for the Dungowan and Emu Swamp dams and pipelines, the Hughenden irrigation scheme and the Wyangala Dam wall raising will be deferred “to be reconsidered once business cases are completed and viable pathways to delivery” determined

$303m over three years of cuts to the manufacturing modernisation fund and modern manufacturing initiative
$198m over four years from redirecting uncommitted funding from the entrepreneurs’ program
MiscellaneousOther measures cut due to Labor’s spending audit include:
$115.3m in the employment portfolio including the mid-career checkpoint program and reboot participation initiative
$50m from axing round seven of the safer communities program
$16m from axing the future leaders program, for which the governor general, David Hurley, personally lobbied Scott Morrison
$16.8m from agricultural shows, field days and related grants
$15.2m in the home affairs portfolio
$15m in the social services portfolio
$10.4m in the education portfolio
There is also a further $1.6bn of “zombie” measures that were announced by the Coalition but not legislated, including the ​​four-year wait period for new arrivals to receive social security payments, voter ID, pensioner residency eligibility changes, and proposed drug testing of welfare recipients.Coalition reactionOn Monday the Nationals’ shadow infrastructure minister, Bridget McKenzie, accused the Albanese government of pursuing a “vendetta” against rural and regional Australia through the budget.Jim Chalmers’ first budget comes amid a darkening economic outlook. Here’s what could go wrongRead moreMcKenzie said it was “incredibly disappointing” that Labor planned to axe the building better regions fund and “quite offensive” that it framed regional spending as “waste”.She said the energy security and regional development plan was designed to “overcome the challenges which are finally being recognised by the broader commentary and society that are going to come with any trajectory towards net zero by 2050”.“If you’re going to increase our climate ambition, you cannot then simultaneously cut funding to those regions that are going to unequivocally be impacted by that decision.”",2022-10-26
" WWF Australia admitted Tasmanian salmon farms ‘not sustainable’, campaigner says ","Geoff Cousins says head of WWF made the comments privately, despite the organisation having certified a major operator in the past","['Royce Kurmelovs', '@RoyceRk2']","The head of World Wide Fund for Nature Australia admitted in private that Tasmanian salmon farming was “not sustainable”, despite WWF having endorsed the industry’s practice through its certification program until 2019, environmentalist Geoff Cousins has said.Cousins said the chief executive of WWF, Dermot O’Gorman, made the comments last month after Cousins challenged the organisation over whether its former certification program had worked to protect the marine environment or wildlife.WWF confirmed to Guardian Australia that conversations took place, but did not immediately respond to questions about what was said.The year after the 2018 Macquarie Harbour fish kill, when about 1.35m salmon and trout died, WWF cut ties with Tassal, its industry partner, and commissioned Seafood Advisory Ltd to investigate the causes of the kill.Its report, released on Wednesday, said the certification scheme had been successfully implemented over the six-year partnership between the organisations, but it had failed to prevent “adverse ecological outcomes”.“The [Aquaculture Stewardship Council] standard has not been set up to ‘prevent’ adverse situations occurring in the first place, and the outcome-focused metrics are not flanked by requirements for mechanisms to address identified potential impacts before they ‘become established’,” the report said.Tasmania’s salmon industry expansion has no sound scientific basis, expert who quit review panel saysRead moreWhile the WWF released a public statement, it was not as strident as the private comments reported by Cousins, who kept notes from his conversations.“I would have preferred they say it was unsustainable publicly,” Cousins said. “It did finally publish the report, it did finally issue a reasonably comprehensive statement and it was honest in saying there are major problems there.”O’Gorman said on Friday: “This independent report makes it clear that the Tasmanian government must play the central role in addressing these issues to achieve the industry-wide reform.”Tassal directed all questions to the Tasmanian Salmon Growers Association, whose spokesperson, Julian Amos, said the industry rejected the findings of the report “in the strongest possible terms”.“Accreditation involves a rigorous process,” Amos said. “It is passing strange that the WWF took no action for more than three years and left it for five years before making any comment, and has not acknowledged action taken since that time.”Jilly Middleton from Environment Tasmania said the report meant the industry could no longer “greenwash their product”.“There were local groups of just one or two people that were passionate about their local waterway being trashed, who were organised and coordinated to speak up and lobby WWF,” Middleton said.The Bob Brown Foundation and the Tasmanian Alliance for Marine Protection also welcomed the news and called for supermarkets to stop stocking the fish.Booker prize winning author Richard Flanagan, whose book Toxic has galvanised the campaign against the industry in recent months, said the pressure was now on the RSPCA to withdraw certification from Huon, another major fish farming operation.“The industry cannot go on as it is and needs to fundamentally transform – or it will collapse,” Flanagan said.Few details exist about the RSCPA’s certification scheme, though its financial reports show it generated $1.57m from its approved farming endorsement scheme.An RSCPA spokesperson said in a statement that the organisation’s certification scheme cost $1.8m to run across all species and that the licensing fees supported its independent monitoring.“Robust animal welfare certification schemes are expensive to run due to the high costs of conducting regular assessments,” it said. “Compared to other schemes internationally and nationally, the assessment frequency of the RSPCA Approved Farming Scheme is very high.”Huon’s RSCPA certification is a point of pride for the company, with the founder and chief executive officer, Peter Bender, telling investors in its end-of-financial year reporting last week that it “ensures best practice”.“The RSPCA accreditation is one that I am most proud of because Huon is the only seafood producer in RSPCA’s approved farming scheme,” Bender said.Huon rejected any suggestion its farms were not meeting RSPCA standards and said in a statement it shared concerns about why the WWF had “endorsed sub-standard salmon farming operations in Macquarie Harbour in the first place”.“The RSPCA subjects Huon Aquaculture to rigorous and ongoing assessment to ensure it is meeting the highest animal welfare standards,” it said.Salmon farming in Tasmania is undergoing a massive expansion, with plans by the state government to double the industry by 2030.The industry has met sustained opposition from environmental groups over what they say is the significant environmental impact on the state’s sensitive waterways and sheltered river estuaries from the concentrated effluent produced by the fish pens.",2021-09-10
Plastic rafting: the invasive species hitching a ride on ocean litter ,"There is now so much ocean plastic that it has become a route for invasive species, threatening native animals with extinction","['Seascape: the state of our oceans is supported by', 'About this content', 'Russell Thomas']","Japan’s 2011 tsunami was catastrophic, killing nearly 16,000 people, destroying homes and infrastructure, and sweeping an estimated 5m tons of debris out to sea.That debris did not disappear, however. Some of it drifted all the way across the Pacific, reaching the shores of Hawaii, Alaska and California – and with it came hitchhikers.Nearly 300 different non-native species caught a lift across the ocean in what can be thought of as a “mass rafting” event. The Smithsonian Environmental Research Center in 2017 counted 289 Japanese marine species that were carried to distant shores after the tsunami, including sea snails, sea anemones and isopods, a type of crustacean.A striped beakfish swims in a water-filled box onboard a Japanese boat that washed ashore in Washington state, US. Five of the fish survived hitching a ride across the Pacific. Photograph: Allen Pleus/APPlastic rafting poses a huge and mostly unknown danger. Invasive species that ride plastic litter to new shores can reduce habitats for native species, carry disease (micro-algae is a particular threat), and put further strain on ecosystems already pressured by overfishing and pollution. According to David Barnes, marine benthic ecologist at the British Antarctic Survey and visiting lecturer at Cambridge University, rafting increases “extinction risk [while] reducing biodiversity, ecosystem function and resilience”.The tsunami also showed something new: many of the animals survived more than six years adrift, longer than previously thought possible.Rafting – or oceanic dispersal – is a natural phenomenon. Marine organisms attach themselves to marine litter and travel hundreds of kilometres. Free-floating clumps of seaweed such as sargassum, sometimes 3 metres thick, provides a home for certain “rafting species” in the Atlantic, such as reef fish, or pipefishes and seahorses, which are both poor swimmers.A 2018 estimate of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch,A 2018 estimate of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, which disperses plastic litter to the remotest corners of the planet. Graphic: GuardianBut while it is relatively rare for a non-native species to successfully survive in a new environment, the huge increase in waste being dumped at sea, as well as abandoned fishing gear, enables biofouling: aquatic organisms attaching themselves where they are not wanted.This turns “a rare, sporadic evolutionary process into a quotidian one”, says Prof Bella Galil, curator at Steinhardt Museum of Natural History, Tel Aviv University. Invasive species can threaten biological diversity, food security and human wellbeing. Sea grapes from Australia arriving in the Mediterranean in 1990, for example, displaced other marine algae – setting off a domino effect that ultimately led to a reduction in native gastropods and crustaceans.One of the most potent corridors for marine invasions is from the Red Sea, via the Suez canal, into the Mediterranean. Galil notes that of 455 marine alien species currently listed in the eastern Mediterranean, most are thought to have come through the canal, thanks to the prevailing northward current or via ballast water, hitching a ride mostly on plastics.Ocean debris floating off Hawaii has become home to many fish and invertebrates. Photograph: Bryce Groark/AlamyThese invasive species do not just hang around. Many have spread into the central and western Mediterranean, again often colonising floating litter. As well as adversely affecting critical habitats, Galil says, some are “noxious, poisonous, or venomous and pose clear threats to human health”. Long-spined sea urchins and nomad jellyfish, both venomous and both native to the Indian Ocean, are just two examples now causing damage in the Mediterranean.The route is likely to become even more popular after the widening of the canal, Egypt’s response to the grounding of the container ship Ever Given earlier this year. “Larger canal, larger vessels [will mean] likely larger volume of Red Sea species arriving in the Mediterranean,” Galil says.Plastic rafting is far from limited to the Mediterranean. There has been a hundredfold increase in marine plastics in the past two decades, which Barnes calls an “ecosystem changer”.“Plastic, particularly, has massively increased the transport possibilities in terms of how much flotsam there is, its variety (in size and structure), where it goes and how long it floats for,” he says. “Furthermore, plastic can increase local spread of invader species when they do arrive and establish.” One compilation from 2015 listed 387 species, from micro-organisms to seaweeds and invertebrates, found to have rafted on marine litter, in “all major oceanic regions”.The most important thing is to plug the marine litter tapEva BlidbergBarnes has even found plastic raft invaders in the Southern Ocean, disproving the idea that Antarctica’s freezing temperatures would keep them at bay. The Antarctic may be particularly sensitive to such invasions, with its endemic species having evolved in near isolation, and within a very narrow range of environmental conditions. “Any species lost here is a loss of global biodiversity: they only live around Antarctica, and the blue carbon [CO2 held in oceans] they store provides some powerful fightbacks against climate change,” he says – blue carbon referring to the carbon held by ocean life, such as kelp and coral polyps.With the surface of the ocean now dotted with plastic, there is no limit to where it can travel, taking invaders with it. Tens of thousands of species can migrate from “anywhere to anywhere, on durations of days to decades”, Barnes says.One of the key interchanges on this marine expressway network is the North Pacific Gyre, home to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, the largest concentration of plastic in our oceans. Here, currents and marine debris converge, and the currents then disperse the litter to the remotest corners of the planet. Similarly, the South Pacific Gyre is thought to be responsible for the (mainly plastic) litter on beaches on Rapa Nui (Easter Island).According to a 2018 study in Marine Pollution Bulletin by researchers at Spain’s University of Oviedo, 34% of debris examined on Easter Island carried organisms from elsewhere. These included water striders, a stony coral called Pocillopora and Planes major, a species of crab. Another study by the same authors found plastic rafting along about 120 miles (200km) of coastline on the Bay of Biscay, with plastic fishing, leisure and household goods carrying non-native invasive species such as the giant Pacific oyster and the Australian barnacle.Burning marine organisms off a Japanese dock that broke free during the tsunami and came ashore in Oregon the following year. Photograph: ReutersSome of the world’s most precious environments could be threatened, including the Galápagos Islands. With a plastic crisis so bad that 400 plastic particles have been found per square metre on the islands’ worst-affected beaches, and some of that plastic already known to host non-native species, it is not hard to imagine an invasive species soon threatening the islands’ famously unique wildlife. Other remote islands such as Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha are also “highly vulnerable to invasion”, Barnes has reported, due to “little marine traffic and intact endemic species”.In 2018, Barnes went a step further, describing marine plastic as an ecosystem in itself, in which the only winners are the colonising fauna, what he referred to as the “plastisphere”.So what can be done about the plastisphere and who is responsible? In the context of the Suez canal, Galil says: “If we adhere to the ‘polluter pays’ principle, Europe is complicit – the canal mainly serves Europe.” But she also argues for an immediate reduction in the amount of plastics in the environment – and “until then, a strictly enforced prohibition of ocean dumping”.Tracking technology may also help, such as the Integrated Marine Debris Observing System (IMDOS), a proposed – though not yet implemented – system that would combine satellite imagery, trawl surveys, observations from ships, and data submitted to various organisations to keep track of marine litter.Inspecting a Japanese vessel on Long Beach, Washington state. Nearly 300 species of marine fauna are reported to have been carried across the Pacific on debris from the tsunami. Photograph: Russ Lewis/APAnother effort to standardise the monitoring of marine plastic is Floating Ocean Ecosystems (FloatEco), a multidisciplinary project, partly funded by Nasa, to “better understand dynamics of floating plastics in open ocean environments”. And there are organisations such as Ospar, which brings together 15 governments and the European Union to cooperate in the environmental protection of the north-east Atlantic Ocean.“A global problem like marine plastic litter, and all the challenges it creates, is impossible to solve without collaboration,” says Eva Blidberg, former project leader for Blastic, a recent EU initiative to map and monitor marine plastics in the Baltic Sea.But with the pandemic leading to an estimated 1.6m tonnes of single-use PPE being discarded daily, some of it ending up in the ocean, the problem is only worsening. When Barnes first flagged the threat of plastic rafting in 2002, he found it hard to convince people that it was a cause for concern. “Now society is so rabbit-in-headlights in a blizzard of climate and biodiversity problems that it is still difficult to convince folk that it is worth worrying about,” he says.Given it is impossible to stop organisms from doing what they will, the only real way to repel the raft invaders is to take away their rafts. Monitoring and collaboration are important, says Blidberg, but she adds: “The most important thing is to plug the marine litter tap.”",2021-04-02
ReviewUtama review – gentle study of Bolivian family facing the end of their way of life,Meditative drama follows non-professional leads playing a farming couple being driven from their home in the Andean plateau by global heating,['Cath Clarke'],"Bolivian director Alejandro Loayza Grisi started his career as a photographer then turned to cinematography; now he makes his feature debut with this slow and beautiful-looking drama set high on the Andean plateau. It’s a film that unfolds at such a measured pace that at times it felt to me like a piece of cinematic mindfulness or a concentration training exercise. I wouldn’t have been surprised if a voiceover gently interrupted proceedings, like a mindfulness app, to gently instruct us not to let our thoughts wander.Utama opens with the staggeringly gorgeous image of an elderly man walking towards the sun rising golden over mountains. This is Virginio (José Calcina), whose weathered face is as cracked as the earth beneath his feet. Virginio spends his days tramping across the plain grazing his flock of fluffy llamas; he and his wife Sisa (Luisa Quispe) live without running water or power. They are a couple in real life, non-professionals discovered by Grisi as he drove around scouting locations. You can see that closeness in every gesture, in Sisa’s arthritic fingers tenderly patting her husband’s hand.It’s Sisa’s job to fetch water while Virginio grazes the llamas. The trouble is that rain has stopped coming to the region; the village well has dried up. “Time has gotten tired,” a friend tells Virginio, to explain the drought. But the truth is that climate change is making life unbearable – not that global warming is ever spoken about.In fact, until the couple’s grandson Clever (Santos Choque) shows up wearing a hoodie, we could just as easily be watching a film set in the 1920s as the 2020s. Clever wants his grandparents to move to the city with the rest of the family. What he fails to understand is that the question for Virginio and Sisa is not where to live, but where to die. And when they are gone, there will be no one left in the family to speak the indigenous Quechua language or live their way of life. It’s a gentle and superbly shot film. Utama is released on 25 November in cinemas.",2022-11-21
Country diary: Make hay while the sun shines? That can be tricky in Cumbria,"Tebay, Cumbria: Getting the grass cut, baled and stored in the barn is one of the biggest and most important jobs of the year",['Andrea Meanwell'],"At least three days of hot, sunny weather are needed to make hay, and good weather is often in short supply in Cumbria. We had been watching our weather apps avidly, and a window appeared. The grass had grown long enough to make hay, the seed had set and there were no nesting birds in the fields, so it was all systems go.My son had mown the grass and “scaled it out” each day. As the grass is turned and tedded, the seeds can return to the meadow. The sheep’s hooves will trample in the seed and help it germinate to revive the meadow. Unfortunately, the starter motor had gone on the tractor – all our equipment is secondhand, and most of it very old – and I was queueing at the engineer’s parts counter when my son phoned to say that it was raining on the side of Blencathra where he was shepherding, and he was going to race home to get the hay in.Andrea Meanwell’s son takes a break after he and his friends brought the hay bales into the barn. Photograph: Andrea MeanwellGetting the grass cut, scaled out, rowed up, baled and stored in the barn is one of the biggest and most important jobs of the year. When I arrived home with the part, four friends from my son’s Young Farmers’ Club were helping and had already borrowed a neighbour’s tractor. We are delightfully old-fashioned in this valley; if someone needs to borrow something or needs help to do a job, it is never a problem. They say it takes a village to raise a child, but it takes a good farming community to get the hay in when it starts raining.The bales were getting slightly damp, so they were put into the cowshed and spread out to dry. It will take a week or so, but they will be fine. They can then be stacked in our 18th-century barn until we need them to feed sheep and goats over the winter. The scent of the hay is overwhelming in the farmyard. As soon as you open the farmhouse door, the smell hits you. Usually after haymaking, everyone is so hot and scratched that we jump in the river. This year, everyone was damp, so it was cups of tea for the Young Farmers before they went to play in a football match at Great Asby in the Westmorland Dales.

 This article is more than 5 months oldA giant oarfish: the mirrored harbinger of earthquakesThis article is more than 5 months oldHelen Sullivan,"Oarfish swim vertically, moving up and down and side to side like a cursor. It would be easier to believe they do not exist",,"A giant oarfish, also known as the “king of herrings”, is an eight-metre long ribbon of silver, tapered at its tail and on its head wearing a permanently stunned face – as though moments ago it was a normal herring and then the world’s largest chef slapped it down on a benchtop and rolled over it with a rolling pin.“These are unpredictable fish,” research biologist Milton Love told the New York Times 10 years ago. But in Japan, oarfish are considered highly predictable: they predict the future. See an oarfish, the story goes, and an earthquake will follow. In the months before Japan’s 2011 earthquake, one of the most powerful ever recorded, 20 oarfish were found on beaches.

Things don’t look good: looking east it sees plum and cherry blossoms, looking west it sees a maple tree making “fire in the branches”.A tortoise: it does not live inside its shell, it is its shell | Helen SullivanRead moreBecause the oarfish has no scales, its silver body acts like a mirror: from far away, it disappears into the grey of the sea, a polished knife dropping to the floor. Oarfish swim vertically and awkwardly, moving up and down and side to side like a cursor. And yet they are hardly ever caught in nets. It would be easier to believe that they do not exist, that 16 buff US navy sailors had not stood in a row, each one gripping part of the fish, and the tail and nose still stuck out on each side.A very, very small brain: ‘a pea in the head’.

The cookiecutter shark has a mouth like a miniature bear trap and weird, unsightly lips – lips that look like your mouth feels when its been in saltwater too long. It had bitten the oarfish, determined to taste the shine, to know if it was hallucinating – to taste, perhaps, its own reflection (a wish we must hope was not granted, for the shark’s sake).Isistius brasiliensis: the curious cookiecutter shark. Photograph: Wikimedia CommonsIn the French documentary, Roberto, a diver wearing a silver wetsuit, tries to collect samples from an oarfish that has come to investigate a buoy with a very long chain. As the diver uses a broom-like contraption to touch the fish’s skin, the subtitles tell us that Roberto relies upon the “curiosity of fish for man and for the buoy”.Of course, the fish does not read, so it confuses homophones and is stunned for the rest of its life that such a transformation has taken place. One side of the fish’s face sees a buoy/boy, the past, and on the other, the silver man he will become. The oarfish rolls its eyes downwards and tries to see its own tail, to know its own end, to predict, at last, something about itself. Helen Sullivan is a Guardian journalist.

","['Supported by', 'About this content', 'Eliza Spencer']","Almost 2,000 firetrucks in NSW still do not comply with national standards, three years after an inquiry found the trucks lacked the necessary safety features to protect crews during a burn over.With the state facing what is forecast to be the most dangerous fire season since 2019-20, the Rural Fire Service has so far upgraded or replaced only 400 of its 2,294 firetrucks that do not meet the standards.The NSW bushfire inquiry in 2020 recommended all of the service’s pre-2008 trucks be retrofitted with halo self-protection sprays and burn over curtains, which drop down to protect crew inside the cabin from the radiant heat of a bushfire.Australia now in El Niño climate pattern, increasing bushfire risk, BOM saysRead moreWithout those upgrades, the inquiry heard, firefighters have to shelter beneath woollen blankets. The service’s remaining 4,000 vehicles already fit the standards.“Fixing 400 of them in a few years is as much as we can physically get done,” RFS commissioner Rob Rogers told Guardian Australia. “Of course, there’s still a lot to be done.”The Bureau of Meteorology on Tuesday confirmed Australia was in an El Niño climate pattern, further increasing the chances of a hot, dry and bushfire-prone summer. Catastrophic fire conditions have already been recorded on the state’s south coast.Two years of cooler and wetter conditions have led to thick regrowth across the state, presenting a challenge for fuel reduction burns. The RFS set a target of 300,000 hectares of hazard reduction burns in the 2023-2024 financial year, and since 1 July has burned about 40,000 – or 13% of the target.“Last financial year we did 24% of what we wanted, which was quite bad,” Rogers said. “This year we’ve made a reasonable start, but we still have a lot more to do.”NSW RFS commissioner Rob Rogers. Photograph: Bianca de Marchi/AAPThe NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, which manages fires on public land, has conducted 76,000 hectares of hazard reduction burns since 1 January.

Jason Heffernan, chief officer of Victoria’s Country Fire Authority, said this partnership would play a significant role in reducing the risk of catastrophic fires in “one of the most bushfire prone areas in the world”.But he added that fire safety was a shared responsibility for all those living and working in high-risk areas.‘Worst risk since black summer’: NSW south coast fire danger upgraded to ‘catastrophic’Read moreFirefighters in Queensland have been working to contain a fire in the Glass House Mountains national park on the Sunshine Coast this week.The Queensland environment minister, Leanne Linard, commended their efforts and said the season ahead will be “challenging”.“After three years of above average rainfall across Queensland as well as forecasts of drier conditions this year, with below median rainfall and above median maximum temperatures, we knew the 2023 bushfire season would be challenging,” she said.Queensland has so far conducted 666,464 hectares of hazard reduction burns.The Australian and New Zealand National Council for Fire and Emergency Services, which manages the procurement and deployment of firefighting aircraft, said the lengthening fire seasons in both the northern and southern hemispheres has caused an increasing period overlap. The council’s CEO Rob Webb said this meant the “previously successful strategy” for sharing aircraft “will be challenged in future years”.Creating a sovereign aerial firefighting capability was a key recommendation from the royal commission into national disaster arrangements.Since the report’s release, Australia bought a national large air tanker, named Phoenix, to be used in firefighting efforts across the country.",
" Flood gardens to combat drought and biodiversity loss, says Natural England",Experts say ditching concrete and creating mini wetlands could help water systems cope better with effects of extreme weather,['Helena Horton'],"This year has seen one of the driest summers on record, with most of the country still officially in drought. Millions of people in England are under hosepipe bans because of water shortages, and reservoir and river levels remain low.The solution to this? People should flood their gardens and create bogs in order to stop the effects of drought and reverse biodiversity loss, according to the head of Natural England.Tony Juniper, who leads the government quango, said that concreted-over front gardens, and backyards which do not hold much water, could contribute to sewage spills into waterways as surface water runs off the hard or dry surfaces.He recommended that people turn their gardens into wetlands, which can hold water and prevent run-off. This would also create habitats for many creatures.“I was in a conversation the other day with a couple of colleagues in the water industry,” he told the Gathering nature festival at Wild Ken Hill in Norfolk. “Everyone knows about combined sewage outfalls, with sewage going into the rivers. Part of the problem there is rapid runoff coming off hard surfaces, where you’ve got a lot of water being put into the drains, which also get the sewage, and they overflow.”He said that one of the measures water companies are now thinking about is catching water in gardens, and part of this could be about creating a miniature wetland in our backyards.“It’s looking at the extent to which you might be able to interrupt water flow before it gets to the sewage and into the rivers,” said Juniper.“And that’s an interesting way of engaging people who actually don’t see a connection between their house and the river – by going down this route of making gardens wilder to hold more water.”Nature organisations agree, recommending that people create “bog gardens” which can help wildlife and store water. This could be a small, flooded corner of a garden in which insects thrive.Ali Morse, water policy manager at the Wildlife Trusts, told the Observer: “There are 400,000 hectares of domestic gardens in the UK – a vast area covering much more than all the nation’s major nature reserves put together – and they have huge potential to help us tackle the interlinked climate and nature crises.“Making your garden wilder and wetter will help wildlife and also play an important role in making your garden less prone to drought and in reducing pollution in local rivers.”The loss or degradation of natural wetlands, she said, is linked to a huge decline in wildlife, from frogs and toads to water voles and insects.“If you’ve no space for a traditional pond, consider a bird bath, a low-level water dish for hedgehogs and other mammals to drink from, a bog garden or a bucket pond, which can be a lifeline for insects such as butterflies and bees. Everything needs water. People are often amazed to discover the huge variety of aquatic wildlife that finds its way to ponds: dragonflies and damselflies, grass snakes, hedgehogs, foxes and birds all need water to survive.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many aquifers have their recharge cut-off by impermeable, hard surfaces like roads, driveways and buildings. This means rainwater is diverted into storm water and can cause sewage overspills during heavy downpours. We need to rebuild local water cycles and allow this water to infiltrate and follow its natural path.”Build back wetter: how to hold water in your garden Remove hard landscaping to let rain soak away into the soil Ponds and bog or rain gardens will retain water in times of heavy rain, helping to prevent flooding elsewhere; they also store water in times of drought Install a water butt for capturing rain to prevent it from adding to the overloaded sewage system.

 Death toll exceeds 180 as Germany and Belgium hit by devastating floods,"Search for missing continues, with Netherlands, Switzerland and Luxembourg also affected","['Jon Henley', ' Europe correspondent', '@jonhenley']","The death toll from catastrophic floods in western Germany and Belgium has risen to more than 180, as emergency services continued their search for hundreds still missing.The German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said he was “stunned” by the devastation caused by the flooding and pledged support to the families of those killed and to cities and towns facing significant damage. It is Germany’s worst natural disaster in more than half a century.“In the hour of need, our country stands together,” Steinmeier said on Friday afternoon. “It’s important that we show solidarity for those from whom the flood has taken everything.”The Ruhr river in Essen, North Rhine-Westphalia, before and after the floodingThe Ruhr river in Essen, North Rhine-Westphalia, before and after the flooding.Authorities in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate said that 110 people had died there, including at least 12 residents of an assisted living facility for people with disabilities, while neighbouring North Rhine-Westphalia put the death toll at 43. One person died in Berchtesgadener Land, a spokeswoman for the Bavarian district told Agence France-Presse.Officials warned the figures could rise further. Many people in the Ahrweiler district of Rhineland-Palatinate remain unaccounted for, although efforts to contact them were being hindered by damage to phone networks.Experts said the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS) issued an extreme flood warning earlier this week and questioned why the toll was so high. Hannah Cloke, a hydrologist, told Politico the disaster was “a monumental failure of the system”.The German weather service DWD said it had passed on the warning to local authorities, who should have been responsible for organising any necessary evacuations. The interior minister, Horst Seehofer, said Germany “must prepare much better” in future, adding that “this is a consequence of climate change”.mapSteinmeier called for greater efforts to combat global warming. “Only if we decisively take up the fight against climate change will we be able to limit the extreme weather conditions we are now experiencing,” he said.Experts said such disasters were likely to happen more often due to climate change. “Some parts of western Europe …… received up to two months of rainfall in the space of two days,” World Meteorological Organization spokesperson Clare Nullis said.While she said it was too soon to blame the floods and preceding heatwave on global heating, Nullis said the climate crisis was “increasing the frequency of extreme events while many single events have been shown to be made worse by global warming.”Belgium’s death toll has risen to 27 , with another 20 still missing. Most of the dead were found around Liège, a city of 200,000 people, despite an order for residents of central districts and areas bordering the Meuse River to evacuate.Verlinden said water levels on the Meuse running into the Netherlands remained critical. “There are a number of dikes on the Meuse where it is really touch and go whether they will collapse,” she said.The army has been sent to four of the country’s 10 provinces to help with rescue operations and evacuations, along with teams of emergency workers dispatched from Italy and France. Residents of some towns, including the resort of Spa, which has been under water since late on Wednesday, were being accommodated in tents.While they have so far suffered no loss of life, Switzerland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands were also severely affected, with flash floods sweeping through the Swiss villages of Schleitheim and Beggingen, several towns in the Grand Duchy evacuated on Thursday, and thousands told to leave their homes in the southern Dutch city of Maastricht.The water level in the Maas, as the Meuse is known in Dutch, reached its maximum forecast height in Maastricht on Thursday night but stayed below what authorities had termed the “doom scenario”, averting widespread flooding.Flood damage in the Blessem district of Erftstadt, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Photograph: Rhein-Erft-Kreis/APAt least 550 households were evacuated in Roermond, while authorities in Venlo evacuated about 200 hospital patients due to the looming threat of flooding from the river. The caretaker prime minister, Mark Rutte, formally declared a disaster, freeing up state funds to pay for the damage.By far the highest death toll was in Germany, where 114,000 households were without power and rescuers on Friday were focusing their efforts on helping people trapped in their homes in the town of Erftstadt, south-west of Cologne.Regional authorities said several people had died or been reported missing after their houses collapsed when the ground beneath them sank suddenly in a major landslide. Aerial photos showed what appeared to be a massive sinkhole.Moselle water levels“We managed to get 50 people out of their houses last night,” Frank Rock, a local official, said. “We know of 15 people who still need to be rescued … One has to assume that, under the circumstances, some people didn’t manage to escape.”Roads around Erftstadt were impassable, with rescue crews trying to reach residents by boat and having to rely on walkie-talkies to communicate. “The mobile network has collapsed. The infrastructure has collapsed. Hospitals can’t take anyone in. Nursing homes had to be evacuated,” a regional government spokesperson in Cologne said.More rain was forecast for parts of the region, where water levels in the Rhine and its tributaries continued to rise. Nearly 1,000 soldiers have been deployed to help with rescue operations and rubble-clearing in affected towns and villages.00:01:16Germany: hospital workers battle against rising flood waters – video reportAt least 24 people were confirmed dead in Euskirchen, one of the worst-hit towns. Reporters on the scene described a normally well-ordered centre transformed into a mountain of rubble and house fronts ripped off by the floods.Thousands of people remain homeless after their houses were destroyed or deemed at-risk by authorities, including several villages around the Steinbach reservoir that experts say could collapse under the weight of the floods.“I fear that we will only see the full extent of the disaster in the coming days,” the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said late on Thursday in Washington, where she is visiting Joe Biden, calling it a day “characterised by fear, despair, suffering”.00:01:33Merkel and Biden express sympathy for German flood victims  – videoShe said her government would not leave those affected “alone with their suffering,” adding that it was doing its “utmost to help them in their distress”.The conservative governor of North Rhine-Westphalia, Armin Laschet, who is running to succeed Merkel as chancellor in elections due in September, called an emergency cabinet meeting for Friday.Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said he would propose a package of immediate aid at a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, telling the Bild am Sonntag newspaper that it would cost more than €300m (US$354m). A rebuilding program was also needed, he said, and would cost in the billions of euros.Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler before and after the floodsBad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler before and after the floods“It is a reality that extreme weather events will influence our everyday life more strongly in the future,” Laschet said, adding: “We have to continue down Germany’s path towards climate neutrality at a faster pace.”But he also said that the problems caused by the climate crisis “cannot be solved in North-Rhine Westphalia, or Germany”. Malu Dreyer, the governor of Rhineland-Palatinate, said climate change was “not abstract any more. We are experiencing it up close and painfully.”",
Country diary 1922: the thrill of spotting a pine marten,14 September 1922: The rare animal’s reddish brown coat glistened gloriously in the sunshine as he made his way down the mountain,['George Muller'],"CumberlandIt gave us a thrill such as we have not felt for years to happen on the rarest animal in the British Isles. We were descending the steep face of a mountain dominating one of our largest lakes when we saw 200ft below us on an earthy scree an animal whose reddish brown coat glistened gloriously in the sunshine. The radiance of the fur was the impression which remained long after we dwelt with wonderment upon our great good fortune. Brush, almost as long as the body, was outstretched behind. It was carried as a fox carries his brush when he is hunting. We had seen a stoat some hours previously as we made our way up a ghyll between the mountain sides. This creature was of the stoat tribe. But it was almost twice as large.My first encounter with a pine martenRead moreThe pine marten, for this was the beast we saw, was leisurely making his way down the mountain. He neither saw nor winded us, and had we known that it was to disappear over a bank, and that we should never set eyes on it again, we should have alarmed it in the hope that the creature would turn round to examine the intruders on his haunts. But we caught a glimpse of the creamy-white breast and of the sharp-pointed triangular head. The pine marten was far away from a coombe which is supposed to be the stronghold of the remaining members of its race. We are encouraged, therefore, to believe that the woodland beast is increasing. No pine martens have been trapped for years in the district.",2022-09-11
Cuppas for crops: how to make your own fertiliser ‘teas’,"For frugal gardeners, weeds, manure and seaweed can easily be turned into fertilisers perfect for Australian soil – with the help of a pillow case and a bucket",['Paul West'],"Plants don’t need much to be happy.Sunlight, water and food are pretty much all that’s necessary for them to thrive and provide us with delicious homegrown produce. As long as you have chosen a nice sunny spot in the garden and go for the odd wander with a watering can or hose, the first two are taken care of – but providing your plants with all their nutritional needs is where things can get a little more involved.How to grow a verge garden: 'Since I've been doing my gardening, I know half the street'Read moreUnless you’re lucky enough to live somewhere with abundant volcanic soils or on the alluvial flats of an ancient flood plain, in Australia, chances are that you’re dealing with average-to-poor soils to grow your food. Of course, plant nutrition starts with building up your soil through the addition of compost, worm castings and well-aged manure, but we can also give our plants a little nutritional boost through the growing season by watering them with a diluted natural liquid fertiliser.There are plenty of liquid fertilisers that you can buy from hardware stores and garden retailers, though in true DIY frugal gardener fashion, you can easily make your own for next to nothing.Here are three simple natural fertilisers for you to try making. All you’ll need is an old pillow case that you’re happy to sacrifice to the cause, a 20 litre food-grade plastic bucket, and weeds, aged manure or seaweed.Weed teaWeeds are excellent miners of minerals from the soil, making them perfect nutritional bases for fertiliser. Photograph: David RogersWhat happens to all the weeds that you pull from your garden? Weeds are excellent miners of minerals from the soil, and while they can be composted or fed to the chooks, they also make excellent source material for a homemade fertiliser tea.The next time you’re weeding, shake any soil off the root balls, then stuff the pulled weeds into the pillow case. Once the pillow case is full, tie a knot in the top and pop it in the bucket. Fill the bucket with water and let it steep for at least 2 weeks.After that, you can use it to water the garden by diluting it to one part weed tea to 10 parts water. Once the weeds have decomposed, feed them to the worms or the chooks, or pop them on the compost heap.Manure teaSteep the ‘tea’ for two weeks before diluting it to make natural liquid fertiliser. Photograph: David RogersIf you live in a semi-rural area surrounded by farms, you should be able to track down some aged animal manure to use in your garden. Adding manure directly to the soil can be too rich for your tender plants – it could burn them or introduce weeds into your immaculate, weed-free beds.By using the manure to make a ‘tea’, you can gain all the nutritional benefit with none of the risk. All you need to do is stuff your pillow case ‘teabag’ with the aged manure, pop it in the bucket and fill the bucket with water.Let the tea steep for two weeks, then dilute the liquid in a ratio of one part manure tea to 15 parts water. After you’ve used the liquid, simply add the leftover manure to your compost.Seaweed teaIf you count yourself among the many Australians who live within a short drive to the coast, the next time you visit keep your eyes open along the sandy stretches for washed-up seaweed.Seaweed is loaded with all kinds of micronutrients that make an excellent tonic for plants. But before you take the trailer down to your local beach, make sure you check with the local authorities for any restrictions around collecting seaweed, as most shire councils will have some rules about where you can collect it and how much you can take.Break out the trusty pillow case ‘teabag’ and fill it up with seaweed (I don’t even bother rinsing it as the levels of salt will be negligible, but you can give it a quick rinse with fresh water if you like). Pop the pillow case into your bucket, then fill it up with water and let it steep for around a month. Once it’s brewed, dilute the liquid in a ratio of one part seaweed tea to 10 parts water.

"Country diary: A scarlet shimmer of poppies, irresistible to bees","The Marches, Shropshire: On a bright day after a thundery night, the bees are sometimes three or four to every flower",['Paul Evans'],"Scarlet flags unfurl and bees dance in revolutionary fervour. The flags are petals of an oriental poppy, Papaver orientale, in the Goliath group of species that may be called “Brilliant” or “Prince of Orange”. Depending on the intensity of light, it can flash through fiery red and sunset orange at the same time.The oriental species comes from the Caucasus, Iran and Turkey, and has appeared in gardens for centuries. These flowers are an explosion – dangerous, erotic, visionary. Oriental Poppies, painted by Georgia O’Keeffe in 1928, was groundbreaking, not just for its intense colour but for the textures of the flowers and their sense of movement. Maybe it also speaks of opium and sex magic, but it is a mesmerising image.It certainly has that effect on bees too. On this bright day in “flaming June”, after last night’s thunderstorm, the poppy flowers are full of garden bumblebees, Bombus hortorum, sometimes three or four in the same flower. Furry black-and-gold striped with white bums, the bees collide into the scarlet shimmer. Pulled by the visual lure of black patches inside the flower that give the illusion of dark, cavernous spaces, they crash into the rings of paddle-like stamens that carry a sable-purple pollen. These stamens skirt the curious seedhead structure with stigma of spidery, sticky-felt black arms, the diadem of the Mycenaean poppy goddess.The bumblebees have individual, high-pitched whines, like a kind of alarm or a magical note. Their wings vibrate the stamens at a certain frequency until the pollen baskets attached to their legs are full. The bees pull out of the flower to return to the nest. The pollen is potent enough and the bees do not receive nectar from the poppy.Like many bees, garden bumblebees have a cuckoo bee – an impostor species that steals the bee’s identity so that it can gain access to its nest to predate or exploit its colony. Bombus barbutellus looks very similar to Bombus hotorum, but has no pollen baskets on its legs; it steals from the labours of garden bumblebees. In the afternoon sun, the bees leave the poppies to their flames of riot and resurrection. Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary",2023-06-22
" Geese, skuas, cranes and even foxes: avian flu takes growing toll on wildlife ","One ecologist counted 160 dead wild birds while walking round a Scottish loch, and figures from other countries are just as worrying","['The age of extinction is supported by', 'About this content', 'Stephen Moss', '@stephenmoss_tv']","As he walked along the shoreline of a Highland loch on a fine May evening, ecologist and wildlife photographer Peter Stronach could hardly believe what he was seeing. The beach was littered with dead and dying birds: male eider ducks, several species of gulls, a gannet, a puffin and no fewer than 26 pink-footed geese, which should by now have been on the way back to their Icelandic breeding grounds.In all, Stronach recorded 72 individual birds of 17 species at Loch Fleet national nature reserve on the east coast of Scotland on that one day, plus many more in the following days.But these birds had not been killed by a passing predator; nor were they the hapless victims of a sudden storm at sea. The cause of these deaths was a highly infectious – and for birds, usually lethal – virus. Avian influenza H5N1 or, as it is more commonly known, bird flu, is back with a vengeance.What really worries Stronach is the range of species he found. “Earlier this spring, we noticed that avian flu was restricted to the geese; but since then it has spread to other wildfowl, raptors and seabirds.”In previous years, it mainly occurred in winter; now, he says, it is affecting the breeding populations of iconic coastal species such as the eider.Elsewhere in Scotland earlier this month about 20 great skuas were found dead or dying on Fair Isle, with more reported from other breeding colonies on the Shetland Isles. This followed a serious outbreak of bird flu in 2021, when hundreds of skuas died.For any species, these deaths are a serious setback, especially at the height of the breeding season. But for great skuas and pink-footed geese, this news is especially troubling. Scotland hosts 60% of the global breeding population of great skuas, and 90% of the world population of pink-footed geese overwinter in the UK. For these two species, both of which are on the amber list of birds of conservation concern, bird flu could pose a serious threat to their long-term future.Bird flu is by no means confined to the UK. In December 2021, an outbreak in the Hula valley, in northern Israel, killed more than 5,000 cranes out of a wintering population of 30,000 birds. In what the Israeli government called “the deadliest wildlife disaster in the nation’s history”, workers wearing hazmat suits were photographed collecting the corpses. After the outbreak, farmers were instructed to slaughter hundreds of thousands of chickens.Workers in hazmat suits dispose of one of the 5,000 cranes killed in December’s bird flu outbreak in Hula valley, Israel. Photograph: Ariel Schalit/APIn Canada, a deadly strain of bird flu has already ravaged the poultry industry, resulting in almost 2 million chickens being killed. Now it has transferred not only to wild birds but mammals too. While the disease is usually confined to waterbirds, this particular strain has attacked crows, jays, gulls, raptors and even young foxes.The US is suffering what looks to become the worst ever outbreak of bird flu – which farmers are blaming on transmission from wild birds. More than 37 million chickens and turkeys have so far been culled, with more to come. If just one bird tests positive, the farmers must destroy the entire flock.As one report noted: “In Wisconsin, lines of dump trucks have taken days to collect masses of bird carcasses and pile them in unused fields. Neighbours live with the stench of the decaying birds.” Even the bald eagle, America’s national bird, has been affected.Warning notices tell people not to feed the swans from Jennings Wharf in Windsor, England, after a bird flu outbreak in January. Photograph: Maureen McLean/Rex/ShutterstockCould it also affect humans? The answer is, in very rare cases, yes – usually those, such as farmworkers, who have been in close and prolonged contact with infected domesticated birds. From 2003 to 2021, almost 500 people around the world died after catching the virus.Clearly, bird flu is something we need to take seriously. But Stronach is concerned that the current monitoring and surveillance system is designed to protect commercial poultry firms, and is not really adequate for wild bird populations. “We need urgent research to find out what other species it is found in, and, crucially, the mechanisms by which it is spreading,” he says.How to spot bark beetles and deadly fungus: the UK’s new tree-saving lab needs your helpRead moreHe is especially concerned that if dead birds are not collected after an outbreak, they may be scavenged by buzzards, red kites, gulls and skuas, thus spreading the disease even faster.Anyone who finds a dead or dying wild bird, which they suspect might have the disease, should not touch the corpse; nor should they attempt to rescue it if it is still alive.

 Criticism intensifies after big oil admits ‘gaslighting’ public over green aims,Fury as ‘explosive’ files reveal largest oil companies contradicted public statements and wished bedbugs upon critical activists,"['Oliver Milman', '@olliemilman']","Criticism in the US of the oil industry’s obfuscation over the climate crisis is intensifying after internal documents showed companies attempted to distance themselves from agreed climate goals, admitted “gaslighting” the public over purported efforts to go green, and even wished critical activists be infested by bedbugs.The communications were unveiled as part of a congressional hearing held in Washington DC, where an investigation into the role of fossil fuels in driving the climate crisis produced documents obtained from the oil giants ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell and BP.“First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they wish bedbugs on you, then you win,” said Varshini Prakash, executive director of Sunrise. The organization accused Shell of a “legacy of violence and of ignoring the wellbeing of communities across the globe”.Pakistan floods ‘made up to 50% worse by global heating’Read moreThe revelations are part of the third hearing held by the House committee on oversight and reform on how the fossil-fuel industry sought to hamper the effort to address the climate crisis. Democrats, who lead the committee, called top executives from the oil companies to testify last year, in which they denied they had misled the public.The new documents are “the latest evidence that oil giants keep lying about their commitments to help solve the climate crisis and should never be trusted by policymakers”, said Richard Wiles, president of the Center for Climate Integrity.“If there is one thing consistent about the oil and gas majors’ position on climate, it’s their utter inability to tell the truth,” Wiles added.Ro Khanna, co-chair of the committee, said the new documents are “explosive” and show a “culture of intense disrespect” to climate activists. The oil giants’ “climate pledges rely on unproven technology, accounting gimmicks and misleading language to hide the reality,” he added. “Big oil executives are laughing at the people trying to protect our planet while they knowingly work to destroy it.”Several of the emails and memos within the released trove of documents appear to show executives, staffers and lobbyists internally contradicting public pronouncements by their companies to act on lowering planet-heating emissions.Exxon, which recently announced profits of $17.9bn for the three months until June, more than three times what it earned in the same quarter a year ago, has publicly said it is “committed” to the Paris climate agreement to curb global heating.However, the documents released by the Democratic-led House committee include an August 2019 memo by an executive to Darren Woods, Exxon’s chief executive, on the need to “remove reference to Paris agreement” from an announcement by an industry lobby group that Exxon is a member of.Such a statement “could create a potential commitment to advocate on the Paris agreement goals”, the executive warned. A separate note on a 2018 Exxon presentation also admitted that biofuels derived from algae was still “decades away from the scale we need”, despite the company long promoting it as a way to lower emissions.Shell, meanwhile, has committed to becoming a “net zero” emissions business by 2050, and yet the documents show a private 2020 communication in which employees are urged to never “imply, suggest, or leave it open for possible misinterpretation that (net zero) is a Shell goal or target”. Shell has “no immediate plans to move to a net-zero emissions portfolio” over the next 10 to 20 years, it added.A Shell tweet posted in 2020 asking others what they could do to reduce emissions resulted in a torrent of ridicule from Twitter users. A communications executive for the company wrote privately that criticism that the tweet was “gaslighting” the public was “not totally without merit” and that the tweet was “pretty tone deaf”. He added: “We are, after all, in a tweet like this implying others need to sacrifice without focusing on ourselves.”The UK-headquartered oil company, which in July announced a record $11.5bn quarterly profit, also poured scorn on climate activists, with a communications specialist at the company emailing in 2019 that he wished “bedbugs” upon the Sunrise Movement, a youth-led US climate group.Previous releases of internal documents have shown that the oil industry knew of the devastating impact of climate change but chose instead to downplay and even deny these findings publicly in order to maintain their business model.The hearings have been attacked by Republicans as a method to “wage war on America’s energy producers” and the oil companies involved have complained that the documents don’t show the full picture of their stance on the climate crisis.Exxon supports the 2015 Paris climate deal, a spokesman said, claiming that the “selective publication of dated emails, without context, is a deliberate attempt to generate a narrative that does not reflect the commitment of ExxonMobil and its employees, to address climate change and play a leading role in the transition to a net-zero future.”A Shell spokesman, meanwhile, said the committee chose to highlight only a small handful of the nearly half a million pages it provided to the body on its “extensive efforts” to take part in the energy transition.“Within that pursuit are challenging internal and external discussions that signal Shell’s intent to form partnerships and share pathways we deem critical to becoming a net-zero energy business,” he said.",2022-09-17
,Public health experts worry rising grocery costs could increase the risk for diet-related diseases in the long run,"['Supported by', 'About this content']","In April, Kimberly Hart made a resolution to lose some weight on the advice of her doctor. Hart, who is 61 and lives in New Haven, Connecticut, has high blood pressure and cholesterol. These factors, combined with her age and weight, put her at an elevated risk for developing diabetes, and she wanted to do whatever she could to prevent that from happening.One element within her control, Hart thought at the time, was her diet. She started seeing a nutritionist, a cost covered by Medicaid, and eating more healthily. But it wasn’t long before her efforts clashed with the reality of rising grocery costs.In May, Hart began to really feel the pinch of higher prices, and by June, she realized she had to completely upend the way she put food on the table for her and her son.Kimberly Hart prepares a weekend dinner for her and her son.She swapped wheat bread for store-brand white bread, “which is too bad” she said, “because I know that wheat bread is healthier for me, but I also know that white bread is cheaper”. She switched from frozen vegetables to cheaper canned ones, despite lower nutritional value and higher sodium content, and no longer buys fresh fruit. Four months since her April resolution, she said, the scale hasn’t budged.“The more color a plate has the healthier it is, because you get your color from fresh vegetables,” she said. But because of her financial situation, “I can’t really do that”.Inflation is pushing healthy eating out of reach for millions of people like Hart, a trend that public health experts worry could increase their risk for diet-related diseases in the long run. Over the past year, grocery prices have risen rapidly as agricultural supply chains bowed under the pressure of food scarcity, labor shortages and high fuel costs.By the end of July, the cost of eating food at home had increased by more than 13% compared to the same period a year ago, according to the Consumer Price Index. According to a survey conducted by the Urban Institute in June and July, more than 20% of adults reported experiencing food insecurity within the past 30 days, an increase of more than 6% from spring of last year.US launches effort to end hunger by 2030 by expanding benefits and access to healthy foodsRead moreIt might seem counterintuitive but scientists have long pointed to links between poverty and obesity. This week, the Biden administration launched a national strategy to tackle the country’s “urgent, nutrition-related health crisis”, including the “rising prevalence” of diet-related diseases such as obesity.In response to higher prices, people are buying cheaper, processed foods high in calories, sugar and sodium over costlier options like fruits and vegetables, protein and whole grains, according to public health researchers and anti-hunger experts.“Highly processed foods are still the most affordable for people and they can stretch longer and they have a longer shelf life,” said Mariana Chilton, professor and director of the Center for Hunger-Free Communities at Drexel University. “People want to buy healthy food, but then they make the choice to get food that is not as healthy but that stays on the shelf longer and can stretch and helps their kids feel fuller.”Hart gets a can of mushrooms from her pantry to add to a chicken soup.Over the long term, researchers have found that food insecurity – defined by the Department of Agriculture as uncertain access to nutritionally adequate food – is probably associated with obesity, a condition that in turn raises the risk of problems including diabetes, heart disease and strokes.“People in the United States who are more food insecure have higher rates of overweight and obesity,” said Parke Wilde, a professor of food and nutrition policy at Tufts University. Wilde added that low-income people without access to social safety programs are most harmed by inflation-driven food insecurity, and its associated health risks.While researchers have investigated the link between food insecurity and obesity for decades, exactly how the two issues are related remains unsettled, Wilde said. One explanation may be in the uncertainty it brings. “Having a boom-and-bust cycle in how much food you have might have sends a signal to your body that it needs to retain food energy, and that might put people at higher risk of overweight and obesity,” Wilde said.Anti-hunger advocates say that food insecurity driven by inflation illustrates the powerful role that poverty plays in shaping dietary choices and healthy eating, which have historically been framed as a matter of individual decision-making.“There’s this sense that low-income people don’t know how to eat,” said Thomas Reynolds, the chief executive officer of Northwest Harvest, a network of 300 food banks in Washington state. “I just totally reject that. It’s really about just making very practical decisions, because money is so tight right now.”Hart cooks a chicken soup with canned unsalted vegetables to watch her sodium intake.Katrena Ross, 40, a legal assistant and mother of three living in Redford, Michigan, first started worrying about inflation in February. At the time, Ross was already straining to feed her family on a monthly budget of less than $200, a situation that made her especially attuned to even the slightest price increase.As prices began to rise in the spring, Ross couldn’t afford to buy as much fresh produce and meat. Instead she reached for peanut butter and jelly, pasta, boxed macaroni and cheese and $1 ramen noodles – a food she hadn’t purchased in years.“I would love to say that I think about what eating like this would do to me and my kids but that’s not really a luxury that I have, because I can only think about: what am I feeding them now? What do I have to make sure that they don’t go to bed hungry?”Public health experts emphasize that food insecurity takes more than just a physical toll – it can also have harmful psychological impacts.“A lot of people just think about obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, heart disease and yes, all of those can get exacerbated, but a lot of people tend to forget about the emotional consequences,” said Chilton of Drexel University.Eventually, Ross made the decision to move her family back home with her mother and stepfather, a move that allowed the merged household to pool resources and shoulder the burden of inflation together. It’s a choice that also gave her a much-needed peace of mind.“My ability to not provide the basics for my family like food and keeping a roof … that was destroying my mental health,” Ross said. “I felt like I had failed them. I felt like I couldn’t keep them safe or provide for them properly, which for a mom or for any parent really, it really hits your self-worth.”Reynolds of Northwest Hunger said that there are numerous ways that lawmakers can strengthen the social safety net in order to prevent families like Ross’s from experiencing food insecurity in the first place, as well as help them cope with the unexpected costs of rapid inflation.“Poverty and hunger are so closely related, it’s almost interchangeable,” he said. He believes policies such as universal basic income, free school meals and higher payments to people in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap, formerly known as food stamps) could bolster food security and make healthy eating more affordable.Hart reaches for items in her kitchen.For Hart, more generous Snap payments could make a significant difference to her life. Before the pandemic, she estimates she received around $400 a month from the program. But her 20-year-old son recently got a part-time job and the additional income caused their household benefits to drop. Her son is now considering taking a higher-paying position, something that she supports, but she worries that will lead to even further cuts in their monthly Snap allotment.“It’s a catch-22,” she said. These days, she organizes her week around waiting in lines for food pantries, which she relies on for extra produce, dairy and meat.Hart said she feels demoralized that she hasn’t lost any weight since April. Sometimes, she lies to her nutritionist about following a healthier diet, just to sidestep the fact that she can’t actually afford it. “One day, I might wake up diabetic,” said Hart. “If I could just eat healthier … but I can’t.”",2023-12-07
‘People feel unprotected’: Greeks lose faith in state after Storm Daniel and a summer of wildfires,"Before the catastrophe in Libya, the cyclone brought devastation to Thessaly – and there are fears the climate crisis will bring more","['Helena Smith', ' in Athens']","The whiff of death permeates the once fertile plain of Thessaly. Thirteen days may have elapsed since Storm Daniel pummelled Greece – a prelude to the fatal descent it would make on Libya – but even now, as the flood waters slowly recede, families bury loved ones and the authorities begin to catalogue the scale of the destruction, it is clear the agricultural heart of the country has been devastated beyond recognition.What remains is a broken land, rain-sodden and bruised, covered with the detritus of all that fell foul of the storm, animate and inanimate, fish, birds, bees, dogs, cats, livestock, buildings, bridges and roads.This weekend, Greek soldiers in masks and protective suits were frantically collecting carcasses for mass incineration. More than 200,000 animals perished in the storms, officials say, and with fears of outbreaks of infectious disease, there is a race against time to remove putrefying remains from farms and pens in areas frequently described as impassable.“The stench is unbearable,” one reporter told viewers on state-run television. “And it hangs over Thessaly.”At least 17 people lost their lives in floods whose waters continue to submerge fields of cotton and corn, villages and towns in a thick layer of mud and sludge.After Daniel’s devastating impact on Libya – where the death toll has surpassed 11,000 – Greeks are counting their blessings. But anger is also mounting. In a region hit by a ferocious Mediterranean cyclone, or “medicane”, named Ianos, exactly three years ago on Monday, fury is widespread that almost no flood prevention measures had been taken even if most accept that this month’s storms, energised by a summer of unprecedented heat, had not occurred in several hundred years. The downpours unleashed by Daniel were the worst since records began in the 1930s.“You could call it the perfect storm,” Greece’s leading climatologist, Prof Christos Zerefos, told the Observer. “Locked between two meteorological systems it stood still, unable to move from west to east, taking its energy from the ever-warmer sea and [dumping] the equivalent of a year’s rain on Thessaly in two days.”At 80 years old, Zerefos has long been studying changing weather patterns at the Academy of Athens’ research centre for atmospheric physics and climatology. He is the first to say that Daniel was “a very rare” extreme weather event, a storm whose magnitude he did not think he would ever see.But what worries Zerefos is with the atmosphere so destabilised by a changing climate Ianos may not be a one-off. “The Ianos medicane cost about one fifth of the damage [predicted from] Daniel,” he said. “What frightens me is that we’ll have more events like Ianos, say every four or five years, which would not only be highly destructive but very costly.”With so many in Greece’s agricultural heartland facing financial ruin – livestock recovery alone is expected to take years – the centre-right government of Kyriakos Mitsotakis has been put on the defensive.After a summer of devastating wildfires – including a blaze described as Europe’s biggest after ravaging an area the size of New York City in the north-eastern region of Evros – there are growing public concerns that state authorities are ill-equipped to deal with natural disasters in a part of the world already singled out as a climate emergency hotspot. The sight of hapless residents in Thessaly being rescued by volunteers before civil protection units could get to them has reinforced the image of official incompetence.A picture taken with a drone shows a flooded area in Thessaly on 15 September. Photograph: EPAOn Thursday the polling company Metron Analysis, releasing its first survey of public opinion after the floods, noted that 61% of respondents had a negative opinion of the government’s work, versus 57% in May. For the first time since Mitsotakis, who won a second four-year term in June, assumed power, analysts have begun to speak of the nation resembling a “failed state”.“There is a prevalent feeling that Greece is a failed state, that it cannot meet our expectations or [global] challenges,” said Maria Karaklioumi, a political analyst at the polling company Rass. “When Mitsotakis first came to power [in 2019] he promised that the country and state would work better and that hasn’t happened.”Likening Greek sentiment to the backlash against US president George W Bush, whose reputation was badly hit by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, she added: “People right now feel unprotected and abandoned. After the floods and fires, any sense of security that the state should offer has evaporated.”Late on Saturday, in his first annual keynote economic speech since re-election, Mitsotakis emphasised that he would not only highlight challenges posed by the climate emergency – announcing local and EU-funded relief measures for those hit by the floods – but forge ahead with structural changes to a system that has clearly laboured under the pressure of dealing with successive disasters.With the wildfires and floods expected to weigh on an economy otherwise doing well in the aftermath of Greece’s near decade-long debt crisis, the climate, more than any other potential foe has, after Daniel’s passing, clearly become the leader’s public enemy number one.",
 Fukushima to ban Olympic spectators as Covid cases rise,U-turn deals blow to Japan’s hopes of using Games to showcase recovery from 2011 tsunami,['Reuters'],"The Fukushima prefecture of Japan will bar spectators from the Olympic events it hosts this summer owing to rising Covid-19 infections, its governor said on Saturday, reversing a position announced two days earlier by organisers.The decision deals another blow to Japan’s hopes of using the Olympics to showcase its recovery from a devastating earthquake and tsunami that hit the northern coast in 2011, destroying a nuclear power station in Fukushima in the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl.Organisers had said on Thursday there would be no spectators in the host city, Tokyo, as a resurgent coronavirus forced the prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, to declare a state of emergency in the capital that will run throughout the Games, which were already postponed by a year due to the pandemic.But they said some spectators would be allowed in Fukushima and several other prefectures outside the capital. On Friday organisers said football matches in the northernmost main island of Japan, Hokkaido, would be held without spectators.Fukushima, which is hosting softball and baseball games, asked Olympic organisers to ban spectators and the request was accepted, said its governor, Masao Uchibori.“The situation of rising infections in the prefecture warrants no optimism,” he told a news conference.Fukushima’s move comes a day after the Australian Olympic Committee president, John Coates, expressed optimism about audiences in Fukushima. Japan take on Australia in a softball game that will be the first competition of the Olympics on 21 July, two days before the opening ceremony.“Fukushima, which is hosting our girls in the first softball game of the Olympics against Japan – they are still able to have 10,000 at that venue,” said Coates, who is also a vice-president of the International Olympic Committee.Hokkaido’s ban on spectators affected Fukushima’s decision, Uchibori said. “It changed the premise for the organisers’ plans to hold matches with spectators in areas other than Tokyo and surrounding prefectures.”Organisers said there was no change to plans for limited crowds in Miyagi, Shizuoka and Ibaraki prefectures.",2021-07-10
 This article is more than 2 months oldEU agrees law to curb methane emissions from fossil fuel industryThis article is more than 2 months old,"Rules would require firms to report emissions, find and fix leaks, and limit wasteful venting and flaring","['Ajit Niranjan', ' Europe environment correspondent']","The EU has struck a deal that will force the fossil fuel industry to rein in dangerous methane pollution.Under the proposed law, the first of its kind, coal, oil and gas companies would be required to report their methane emissions and take steps to avoid them. The measures include finding and fixing leaks, and limiting wasteful practices such as venting and flaring gas by 2027.Jutta Paulus, a German MEP with the Green grouping who worked on the proposal, said: “Finally, the EU tackles the second most important greenhouse gas with ambitious measures. Less methane emissions mean more climate protection and more energy sovereignty.”Methane has more than 80 times the global heating power of carbon dioxide over a 20-year time span but does not last as long in the atmosphere. Cutting methane emissions is seen as a cheap and easy way to stop extreme weather growing more violent in the short-term.The new EU rules, which were agreed on Wednesday by the European parliament and European Council, mean fossil fuel companies must try to repair leaks no more than five days after finding them, and fully fix them within a month. By the end of next year, operators will have to survey their existing sites and submit action plans to find and fix methane leaks.The rules will also tackle imported fuels, which experts say could raise the bar for fossil fuel companies around the world. Analysis by the environmental nonprofit organisation Clean Air Task Force last month found global methane emissions from oil and gas could decrease by 30% if foreign suppliers were held to the same standards as domestic ones.Brandon Locke, a methane expert at the Clean Air Task Force, said: “Considering the prospect of an import standard was nothing more than a dream a year ago, this outcome is a major step forward. While we preferred a faster timeline to reduce emissions before 2030, this agreement will nonetheless go a long way to dramatically cut global methane pollution.”Methane, which is responsible for about one-third of global heating since the Industrial Revolution, seeps into the air from fossil fuel infrastructure, farms and landfills. The International Energy Agency has found that more than 75% of methane emissions from oil and gas operations and half of emissions from coal can be abated with existing technology, often at low cost.The campaign group Climate Action Network (Can) welcomed the monitoring and reporting measures in the EU’s new rules but said “the biggest loophole” was the timing. The European Commission will be tasked with determining a methodology for the maximum intensity of methane emissions by 2027, and the EU will apply it to imports by 2030.Esther Bollendorff, a gas expert at Can Europe, said: “Applying a methane intensity target only three years after entry into force of this regulation is far too little, too late, as methane emissions from producers outside the EU would risk remaining dangerously high up to 2030.”Under the new rules, EU member states will have to set up a public inventory of coalmines that have been closed or abandoned in the last 70 years and measure the methane leaking from them. Operators will also have to phase out venting and flaring in mines that are still operational. Such practices will be banned in mines that have been shut down from 2030.Sabina Assan, a methane analyst at the clean energy thinktank Ember, said: “The regulation is one of the first of its kind for coalmines, and a massive leap forward in terms of monitoring, reporting and mitigation of methane from underground and abandoned mines. Even so, the requirements for mitigation are not particularly ambitious.”Policymakers have started to pay more attention to methane emissions, which have been unregulated in much of the world. Since the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow two years ago, 149 countries and the EU have joined a pledge to reduce global methane emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030.China, which did not sign the pledge, published a methane action plan last week that did not include an overall target or date. On Tuesday, the US and China said in a joint statement they would include methane reduction targets in their next climate action plans.The Cop28 climate summit opens in the United Arab Emirates in just over two weeks’ time.Flavia Sollazzo, an energy expert from the European branch of nonprofit group Environmental Defense Fund, said: “This is a very clear message from the EU and particularly ahead of Cop28 – that climate responsibility doesn’t stop at its borders. And that as the world’s largest buyer of natural gas, it is prepared to use its influence to help drive global methane emission reduction.”The International Association of Oil and Gas Producers said it was waiting for the full text of the agreement but noted what it described as some “problematic provisions” in the announcement. These included restrictions on technology such as drones to monitor methane emissions and a requirement to quantify subsea emissions, which it said was not technologically feasible today.It said: “Our sector remains supportive of a proportionate, efficient and implementable EU methane regulation. Based on what we have gathered so far on the agreement, it seems to be a mixed bag and there are a lot of unknowns left to clarify.”It added that the rules may have broader consequences for the oil and gas sector, such as shutdowns or forced exposure to penalties for rules with which it cannot comply: “This is far from ideal from a security of supply and competitiveness perspective, even more so in the current context.”

 Fledgling success as hen harrier continues to recover in England,"This summer will have highest number of fledged chicks since 2002, according to Moorland Association","['Patrick Barkham', '@patrick_barkham']","The endangered hen harrier is continuing its recovery from near extinction in England with this summer set to have the highest number of chicks fledging since 2002.Of 24 successful nests producing at least 77 fledged chicks this summer, 19 were on moors managed for red grouse, according to the Moorland Association.The grouse shooting industry hailed the success as a vindication for controversial brood management, in which some chicks are removed from nests and reared in captivity if multiple nests are made on grouse moors.Hen harriers like to nest in proximity to each other, but grouse moor managers complain that concentrations of the bird predate too many red grouse, which provide a lucrative driven grouse shooting season.The brood management trial began in 2018 but was disavowed by conservation groups such as the RSPB, who argue that chicks should not be removed while the illegal persecution of hen harriers continues.“This is another excellent year for hen harrier breeding,” said Amanda Anderson, the director of the Moorland Association. “Three good years in a row shows that we have the right strategy to help the population to recover to a sustainable level, occupying a much greater area of England.“The management carried out on grouse moors by gamekeepers provides an ideal habitat for birds of prey, with fewer predators to steal their eggs, and good numbers of prey species such as small mammals and other birds.”The figures have not yet been confirmed by Natural England, the government’s conservation watchdog, and some conservationists argue the Moorland Association is using a very wide definition of grouse moor to claim so many successful nests are on grouse shooting land.“These are not official figures,” said Mark Avery of the campaign group Wild Justice. “They are from an incredibly vested interest which itself is responsible for the lack of hen harriers. They are trying to make a terrible situation look better than it is.Britain’s national parks dominated by driven grouse moors, says studyRead more“There should be more than 300 pairs of hen harriers nesting in England and there aren’t. There is one solution to the hen harrier problem – stop killing hen harriers, like the law says.”Four young harriers fledged from the RSPB’s Geltsdale reserve for the first time since 2016, but two male harriers disappeared there in the spring, with suspected illegal persecution being investigated by the police.Jim Wardill, the RSPB operations director for the north of England, said: “We know how important the management of our uplands is for the recovery of these birds and hope that this signals that attitudes are changing towards issues such as persecution. Whether the land is managed for water supply, farming, forestry or shooting, we need everyone to work together to build on this success and restore England’s population to the known potential of 300 nests.”Chris Packham and Megan McCubbin are hosting the eighth annual Hen Harrier Day on Saturday, celebrating the bird and efforts to save it, with artwork by Jim Moir – popularly known as the comedian Vic Reeves – being auctioned to raise money for hen harrier protection.",2018-09-25

Police said Bruce had set himself on fire at about 6.30pm on Friday, and was airlifted to hospital.A spokeswoman for the Metropolitan police told the Denver Post that investigators had not found a manifesto or note explaining Bruce’s motive.After the relentless rain, South Africa sounds the alarm on the climate crisisRead moreFriday was Earth Day, an annual global event to demonstrate support for environmental protection, and the supreme court has environmental cases on its docket.Bruce, 50, had recently edited a comment on his Facebook page, adding the date 22 April and a fire emoji. The comment was in response to a post about the global impact of climate change. Bruce had posted several times over the past year about the environment.On Sunday, Kritee Kanko, a Boulder-based climate scientist and Zen Buddhist priest, said Bruce was a friend and member of her Buddhist community, who had been planning the self-immolation for “at least one year”.“This act is not suicide. This is a deeply fearless act of compassion to bring attention to climate crisis,” Kanko said in a tweet.In a subsequent interview with the New York Times, Kanko said she could not be certain about Bruce’s intentions. She told the newspaper that “people are being driven to extreme amounts of climate grief and despair” and that “what I do not want to happen is that young people start thinking about self-immolation”.In April 2018 David Buckel, a prominent gay rights lawyer and environmental advocate, burned himself to death in New York.In a note, Buckel said: “Most humans on the planet now breathe air made unhealthy by fossil fuels, and many die early deaths as a result – my early death by fossil fuel reflects what we are doing to ourselves.”",2022-04-25

" Environment protest being criminalised around world, say experts","More than 400 climate scientists sign letter that says activists are being targeted at pivotal time in fight against global heating

‘I’ll continue to fight’: the prosecuted Extinction Rebellion protesters
",['Matthew Taylor'],"Peaceful environmental protesters are being threatened, silenced and criminalised in countries around the world including the UK and the US, according to some of the world’s leading climate scientists and academics.More than 400 leading experts – including 14 authors from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) – say that non-violent civil disobedience from groups like the school strikers, Extinction Rebellion and the Sunrise Movement have transformed the debate around the climate crisis in recent years.But in an open letter published on Monday they warn governments around the world are criminalising them at a pivotal time in the fight to tackle the escalating climate emergency.“We know that our research alone was not enough for this recent awakening to climate breakdown as an existential crisis for humanity, and recognise that protest movements around the world have raised the alarm,” the letter states, adding: “Those who put their voices and bodies on the line to raise the alarm are being threatened and silenced by the very countries they seek to protect..”In the UK, more than 2,000 people who took part in Extinction Rebellion protests are being taken through the court system in what experts say is one of the biggest crackdowns on protest in British legal history. The scientists also raise concern about efforts to silence climate protests in other parts of the world from the US to France, the Philippines to India.Dr Oscar Berglund, from the Cabot Institute for the Environment at the University of Bristol, helped coordinate the letter. He said the attempt to “criminalise climate protest” was central to the fossil fuel industry’s new strategy of delaying action on climate change.“Now that climate change denialism is in steep decline, they have put their money behind efforts to stifle dissent. Climate scientists, who have been subject to the slander of the fossil fuel lobby for so long, recognise this change in strategy.”The letter is signed by 429 scientists and academics from 32 countries, including leading figures such as Michael Mann and more than 70 other professors. It is also backed by three lead authors and 11 contributing authors on the UN’s IPCC reports.The experts warn that just months before a crucial global climate conference due to be held in Glasgow later this year, it is more important than ever that these groups are able to put pressure on politicians and highlight the role polluting corporations are playing in the escalating ecological crisis.The letter states: “It has become abundantly clear that governments don’t act on climate without pressure from civil society: threatening and silencing activists thus seems to be a new form of anti-democratic refusal to act on climate … [we] therefore urge all governments, courts and legislative bodies around the world to halt and reverse attempts to criminalise nonviolent climate protest.”Prof Julia Steinberger, a lead author with the IPCC who signed the letter, said governments had ignored scientists and the urgency of the climate crisis by claiming climate action was not politically popular.She added “Thanks to the alarm raised by climate activists, this has changed – but instead of acting, many governments are choosing to shoot the messenger, by criminalising nonviolent protest. As scientists, we have a duty to stand with the activists who are paying attention to the science, rather than these governments, who seem to be more swayed by powerful economic interests than by the life chances of their own citizens.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “It is completely incorrect to suggest the UK government is criminalising protest. We support the right to peaceful protest, but this does not extend to criminal behaviour. The public rightly will not tolerate protesters who use disruptive and dangerous tactics that can be incredibly dangerous and a drain on public funds. The measures proposed in the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill will allow police to take a more proactive approach in managing highly disruptive protests.”",
" This article is more than 7 months oldImports of ivory from hippos, orcas and walruses to be banned in UK This article is more than 7 months old",Ministers to close loophole in 2018 Ivory Act that means animals other than elephants can be targeted,['Helena Horton'],"Ivory imports from hippopotamuses, orcas and walruses will be banned under new legislation to protect the endangered species from poaching.The Ivory Act, passed in 2018, targeted materials from elephants, but a loophole meant that animals other than elephants, including hippos, were being targeted for their ivory.After a consultation, ministers have decided to tighten the ban to include all ivory-bearing species, so these will not be poached to fill the gap in the trade left by the elephant ivory ban.Ministers said the hippopotamus was the species most at risk from the trade in its ivory after elephants, and the other species were already threatened by the climate crisis. They added that continued trade in their ivory could exacerbate these threats and make their long-term survival less likely.The elephant ivory ban faced immense challenges, with antique traders taking the government to court in an ultimately unsuccessful battle to squash the legislation.Trudy Harrison, biodiversity minister at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), said: “This is a pivotal moment in delivering one of our key manifesto commitments on international conservation.“The Ivory Act is one of the toughest bans of its kind in the world and by extending greater legal protections to five more species, we are sending a clear message the commercial trade of ivory is totally unacceptable.“The UK has long led the way in conservation and our ban shows continued global leadership in doing all we can to protect the world’s most endangered species.”Ivory is used for ornaments, musical instruments and jewellery, among other items, and animals are poached across the globe for profit in what can be a lucrative market.The hard, white material comes from the tusks and teeth of animals. It consists mainly of dentine, one of the physical structures of teeth and tusks.Charities welcomed the ban. Frances Goodrum, head of campaigns and programmes at the International Fund for Animal Welfare UK, said: “[We] are encouraged by early indications that the ban is having a significant impact on the trade in elephant ivory, yet other species are still poached globally to meet an unnecessary demand for ‘luxury’ ivory products, including the hippopotamus, walrus, narwhal, sperm whale and killer whale.“We welcome Defra’s decision to extend this powerful legislation, which will go a long way in cracking down on a damaging trade. Today is a good day for conservation and a step change towards international commitments to safeguard our natural world.”",2023-05-23

","['Rafqa Touma', '@At_Raf_']","An astonishing number of cabbage hornets and butterflies were “all over the place” when Prof Mark Elgar walked out of the University of Melbourne campus on to Royal Parade last Friday.“I was really quite struck, I haven’t seen something like that before,” he said. In the bioscientist’s front garden, they were “hovering all around” the citrus plants too.“Melbourne and Sydney gardeners have got to be on the lookout, otherwise you are going to find a lot of leaf damage,” Elgar said.

Pieris rapae is colloquially referred to as a cabbage moth, but is in fact a butterfly.It is an invasive species originally from Europe, considered a pest in Australia because it will snack on any plant from the brassica family, which includes lettuce, cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale and brussels sprouts.The insect goes through distinct stages of growth, starting at hatching from an egg and turning into a larva.“That is when they will damage your plants,” Elgar said.The larva feeds on plants until they have expanded beyond their exoskeletons and go through a moulting phase. Then it wraps silk around its body and “goes through this extraordinary metamorphosis where it changes into a butterfly”.Female adults then “search for somewhere to lay their eggs,” which tend to be the underside of leaves.Elgar said the cabbage butterfly influx was occurring in Melbourne and Sydney but “probably hidden in places in-between as well”.“I am sure it is not just an urban city thing.”Gardeners across several states have been taking to social media with images and anecdotes of a “plague” of larvae “decimating” brassica plants and adult butterflies hovering around their gardens.“The reason for that would be the climate,” said Dr Thomas White, an ecologist from the University of Sydney.A mild winter meant more pupate survived than usual. A very warm start to spring, with days as hot as 40C combined with a few inches of rain, created “ideal butterfly and insect conditions” for an abundance of adults to survive and continue laying eggs for the start of a new 30-day reproductive cycle.How to protect your gardenPart of the reason the insect is considered a pest is because “they are just so hardy and resilient in a broad range of conditions,” White said, recalling seeing adults “floating around in winter”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Installing nets over plant bushes will prevent adults laying more eggs. The headline, text and picture caption of this article were amended on 16 November 2023.

Odds released on Monday afternoon by SportsLens had the Open at 4/7 to be hit by further activism. The damaging of Hoylake greens, as an example, could cause significant problems at the Open.Merseyside police, who also preside over the Grand National, say “contingency plans are in place to allow visitors enjoy the Open with minimal disruption”. More than 260,000 golf fans are expected in Hoylake during Open week.Chief superintendent Mark Wiggins said: “The public should expect to see high‑visibility policing across the event as we complement and support other security agencies.“There are a number of plans and processes in place to deal with any incidents that may arise and to prevent any significant or ongoing disruption to spectators and local residents and businesses. Antisocial behaviour, disorder and criminal activity will not be tolerated, and we will be robust with anyone who behaves in such a manner.“Visitors can help the organisers by giving themselves extra time to get to the course, arriving in good time and limiting the number of bags and other items they bring along. They should also expect to undergo the normal security checks, including bag searches.“Additionally, we will be deploying Project Servator officers in uniform and plain-clothes. These officers are specially trained to spot the tell-tale signs that someone may have criminal intent, such as gathering information that may help them plan or prepare to commit a crime.”The R&A has offered no comment on the potential for protests.

" This article is more than 1 month oldKiller kitties: cats are eating 2,000 species, including hundreds that are at riskThis article is more than 1 month old",The first study to quantify what our felines eat on a global scale finds they have a significant impact on wildlife,"['The age of extinction is supported by', 'About this content', 'Phoebe Weston', '@phoeb0']","Cats may be adored human companions, but they are also highly effective killers, according to a study that shows they eat more than 2,000 species globally – including hundreds that are of conservation concern.Since domestication 9,000 years ago, house cats have spread to all continents except Antarctica. In the paper, published in Nature Communications, researchers describe them as “amongst the most problematic invasive species in the world”.“Our study sheds light on the predatory habits of one of the world’s most successful and widely distributed invasive predators,” the researchers, led by Christopher Lepczyk from Auburn University in the US, wrote in the paper.Birds, mammals, insects, and reptiles are all on the menu, 17% of which are of conservation concern according to the research, which is the first to quantify their diet on a global scale.In total, cats eat 981 species of bird, 463 reptiles and 431 mammals – comprising about 90% of species consumed. They were also found to feed on 119 species of insects and 57 amphibians.Cats are particularly damaging on islands, where they eat three times the number of species of conservation concern compared to what they eat on continents. For example, they are known to have eaten species that are now extinct in the wild, including New Zealand’s Stephens Island Rockwren and the New Zealand quail.Their impact on wildlife has spurred fierce debate in New Zealand, where one politician is campaigning to eradicate them completely, and controversy has erupted over competitions encouraging children to shoot feral cats.In the German town of Walldorf, people have been ordered to keep their cats locked inside during spring in order to protect an endangered population of crested larks. Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/AlamyIn Australia alone, cats are estimated to kill more than 300 million animals every year, with conservation groups calling for cats to be kept indoors. Some places have implemented feline lockdowns. In the south-western German town of Walldorf, people have been ordered to keep their cats locked inside for three months in spring to protect an endangered population of crested larks, which breed at that time.Previous research has found there is a “considerable blind spot” when it comes to acting on the “large-scale negative impacts” of domestic cats on native wildlife.The study found about 9% of known birds, 6% of known mammals, and 4% of known reptile species are eaten by cats – and they are not fussy snackers. “Cats are largely eating what is present,” researchers wrote. “If a species is missing in the diet analysis it is likely that the prey is either absent or rare in the surrounding environment”.The scientists reached these figures by trawling through hundreds of existing studies. They believe their final estimates are conservative, and will grow as more research is done. Their study looked at free-ranging domestic cats. Some of the larger animals included in the total count might be scavenged by cats, not necessarily caught as prey.A spokesperson from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) said: “Fitting bells to quick-release collars and keeping cats inside overnight are simple ways to reduce the number of wild birds and other wildlife that they catch. Ultrasonic devices can also be a harmless but effective way to reduce the amount of time cats spend in gardens.Rock climbers like to connect with nature – but are they also destroying it?Read more“Beyond gardens, cat predation can cause particular problems for vulnerable and restricted populations of birds, in particular birds that nest low to or on the ground,” the spokesperson said.“It can also be an issue for birds that have evolved on islands where terrestrial predators would not naturally occur. So, it’s a good idea to limit new residential developments being built too close to important sites for ground-nesting birds, and reduce or remove feral cat populations on islands where they do not belong.”Mike Toms from the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), who was not involved in the study, said it provided “a welcome and much-needed global assessment of the impacts that free-ranging cats have on wildlife”.He said: “That [the study] highlights areas of particular concern – such as the impacts of cats on island populations – will help conservation action to be directed to where it is most needed.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on X for all the latest news and features",2023-12-13
 West accused of double standards over oil and gas exploration in DRC,"Calls by countries such as UK and US to halt auction for drilling permits in the world’s second-largest rainforest branded ‘galling’

Sale of oil and gas permits casts shadow over world’s second-largest rainforest
","['The age of extinction is supported by', 'About this content', 'Patrick Greenfield', '@pgreenfielduk']","The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has criticised the west for pressuring it to halt oil and gas exploration in the Congo basin rainforest, while continuing to search for fossil fuels in their own countries.The Congo basin, more than half of which is located in DRC, is the last rainforest on Earth that sucks in more carbon than it releases and is second only to the Amazon in size. The DRC announced in July that oil and gas permits in parts of the rainforest would be auctioned off. The blocks up for sale include areas in Virunga national park, as well as critically endangered gorilla habitats and the world’s largest tropical peatlands, which store the equivalent of three years of the world’s fossil fuel emissions.The auction has prompted behind-the-scenes efforts to avert oil and gas exploration in DRC’s vital ecosystems, with conservationists proposing alternative livelihood projects or even considering bidding for the licences.But DRC officials have defended the auction ahead of Cop27, where climate justice will be a key issue, arguing that the auction is important for the economic development of one of the poorest countries on Earth. They have also highlighted that countries such as the UK, Norway and the US are urging them not to drill while continuing to explore for new fossil fuels themselves.Map of DRC oil and gas permitsEarlier this month, Eve Bazaiba, DRC’s environment minister, strongly rejected a suggestion by the US climate envoy, John Kerry, to drop some of the fossil fuel auctions at a pre-Cop27 meeting in Kinshasa.“Nobody can put pressure on us,” Bazaiba told Reuters. “No convention in the world, not even the Paris Agreement, forbids a country from emitting CO2 for development reasons. This is not a working group in which a colonialist controls a colony … If we think it could destroy the environment, we will leave it.”Last week, the DRC president, Félix Tshisekedi, told an FT Africa event that the world needed to realise the Congo basin forest was a global asset and must help his country protect it. “We have never said we are going to put the planet in danger … Nobody is helping us,” he said.Sale of oil and gas permits casts shadow over world’s second-largest rainforestRead moreA group of donor countries that make up the Central African Forest Initiative – including the UK, Norway, and Germany – are working with the DRC government to identify conservation projects to benefit from a $500m (£431m) deal signed at Cop26 in Glasgow last year by Boris Johnson. No money has been released so far but DRC has made progress in meeting the agreement, which includes objectives to protect high-value forests and peatlands. In April, concerns were raised about the country’s “lawless” logging sector but it is understood that donor countries are generally pleased with progress since the Glasgow summit.Lee White, the environment minister in Gabon – an oil producer and Congo basin country with a largely intact rainforest – said that fossil exploration in DRC would not necessarily mean that vital ecosystems would be destroyed.“I think there’s a lot of naive, well-intentioned criticism,” said White. “Certainly the Norways and the UKs of this world cannot make a moral call for African nations not to exploit their oil. We are not seeing any of this committed climate funding. It’s not flowing into our countries at all. So, to then be preached to by countries that emitted most of this CO2 is galling.”Critics say drilling for oil in the Congo basin would be a social, biodiversity, climate and human health disaster. Photograph: Kevin McElvaney/GreenpeaceSimon Lewis, professor of global change science at University College London and a global expert on DRC’s peatlands, said drilling for oil in the Congo basin would be a disaster for biodiversity, the climate and human health.“Opening these forests to oil drilling will also lead to illegal commercial hunting and the loss of wildlife. Once forests are degraded outright deforestation typically follows. Add the carbon emissions from deforestation to those from burning the oil, and burning rainforest oil is worse for the climate than burning coal,” he said.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",2022-11-01
 Ofwat urged to do more to make water firms protect environment,Concerns government guidance will not bring an end to the ‘scandal of untreated sewage pollution’,['Sandra Laville'],"Ofwat must do more to make the water industry in England and Wales protect the environment, the government has said.Setting out the priorities for the regulator for the next five years the environment minister Rebecca Pow said water companies should significantly reduce the frequency and volume of sewage discharges from storm overflows.In a strategic policy statement laid before parliament on Wednesday, the government urged Ofwat to challenge water companies on how they would be more ambitious in protecting the environment, and deliver resilient and sustainable water supply.Pow said: “The priorities we are setting out today build on the work we have already undertaken to reduce harm from storm overflows, improve monitoring and reporting of pollution incidents, making this more transparent, to tackle runoff from agriculture, and protect the health of our rivers and seas.”Ofwat is responsible for setting out what water companies should focus their investment on during each five-year spending cycle, the next of which is 2025 to 2030.Martin Salter, the head of policy at the Angling Trust, said he feared the guidance given to Ofwat could fall well short of what was needed to end the scandal of untreated sewage polluting the nation’s rivers.He said the policy statement failed to ensure a step-change in investment by water companies in outdated waste water infrastructure, which has resulted in record levels of discharges in untreated sewage from facilities that can no longer meet demand.In 2020, water companies released raw sewage via storm overflows into rivers more than 400,000 times over a total of 3.1m hours.Salter: “We were hoping for more than warm words in this water policy statement and a bit of restating the pollution monitoring provisions that are already in the Environment Act. This is the government’s opportunity not just to will the end of pollution but to actually deliver the means by getting Ofwat to allow much needed investment to flow into England’s creaking and leaking waste water infrastructure.”The Rivers Trust said the regulator had for too long been too narrowly focused on keeping costs down in the short-term, with little regard for long-term impacts on the environment and the legacy for future generations.Amina Aboobakar, the commercial director for the Rivers Trust, said the statement needed to be more ambitious. She said: “It fails to specify the need for transformational change, provides no direct guidance around investment gaps in failing/ageing infrastructure and how this is to be addressed through the price review, and for the need for water companies to drive more environmental resilience.”Water UK, which represents the industry, said it had long stressed the need for regulation to take a long-term view of the sector and allow increased investment to help address the acute challenges posed by climate change and population growth.“Ofwat must now work with water companies to ensure that the next price review enables the sector to meet government targets by authorising investment in the right schemes such as net zero and improving river water quality,” it said.",2022-02-02
" Glow-worms: as soon as you think you’ve seen them, they blink offHelen Sullivan","As soon as you’re sure you imagined them, on they go again",,"“Thou aeronautical boll weevil / Illuminate yon woods primeval,” the Mills Brothers sang in 1952, imploring glow-worms to “Light the path below, above / And lead us on to love”. John Keats, comparing the fairness of goddess Psyche with the bright white moon and the evening star (spoiler: she is fairer than both), refers to the star as an “amorous glow-worm of the sky”. Seamus Heaney poked a glow-worm with a blunt stick and “a tiny brightening den lit the eye” – turning the stick into a wand.Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo. I’m in Mozambique, it is dark, and there is a wedding tomorrow. I have just had my first – and I don’t know it yet, but only – drink in a coconut. I chose Fanta Grape. Outside at the restaurant, I see my first glow-worms. It is possible that they are fireflies, but they’re still: on the branches of what I hope are hibiscus trees, but then again, I would happily plant a hibiscus in every memory I have.Daddy longlegs: there is one piece of information every child will know | Helen SullivanRead moreI had read about them in James and the Giant Peach. The centipede tells James, “Glow-worms are never worms. They are simply lady fireflies without wings.”“Never worms” is what they are like; you’re not sure of what you’ve seen, they pulse so strangely and each configuration of lit-up worms is so different from the last – so unlike stars, or fairy lights or candles. As soon as you think you’ve seen them, they blink off. As soon as you’re sure you imagined them, on they go again.The peach in the film version of Dahl’s book – like the biscuits eaten by the mice in The Aristocats – was an unattainably delicious thing. The best peach you could possibly imagine, and would never quite manage to eat.The glow-worms were different; they were better in real life. “Glow-worms sell themselves,” a friend said to me when she sent me the Mills Brothers song. And they do. But nonetheless: let’s turn on the light.In the latest of our ""Nature of ..."" series on unusual insects, animals plants and other natural phenomena, @helenrsullivan looks at ... glow-worms https://t.co/RYzkGkIfWJ pic.twitter.com/8iMr59kK3z— Guardian Australia (@GuardianAus) March 29, 2021
Glow-worms are, of course, quite ugly. And being insects, their lives are harrowing and strange in the way only insects’ lives can be. Europe’s common glow-worm injects poison into slugs and snails, liquifying the – why yes, I am prepared to use this term – slug/snail meat. Wikipedia describes it as a “brown broth that the larva can lap up”. The poison doesn’t kill the prey, and sometimes they just slide away, which reminds me of lines from Gus Ferguson’s Chanson: “we heave our heavy portmanteaux / that hold dark secrets none should know / and which is why we go so slow / along the Rue d’Escargot.”In New Zealand, there are caves filled with glow-worms patrolling thin strings of goo decorated with fine droplets. These droplets catch midges, which the glow-worms eat. They need to eat a lot, because the glow-worms eventually transform into “primitive flies” – fungus gnats – whose mouth parts don’t function, which means they are unable to eat anything at all. The flies are a kind of purgatory stage of the insect – a hungry ghost, a lost soul – and then they mate and enter the afterlife. (Fireflies are more romantic. In Mexico, they search for mates on moonless nights before rainy days. These precise conditions occur for just a few hours each year).Glow-worms, fireflies and lightning bugs remind me of thinking, memory and writing. There is the way an idea will appear seemingly by itself, and vanish if you don’t record it. The jump from one scene in your mind to another that “can communicate before it is understood”. The glow-worms laying down their sticky traps: early sentences ready to catch the perfect word – a gnat suspended in a droplet – to reel it in, chew it up, and start again. Is there another gnat, a better gnat? Don’t let it slip away. As the Mills brothers sing: “Shine little glow-worm, glimmer, glimmer / Hey there, don’t get dimmer, dimmer.”And yes, desire and distraction. All the glow-worms in England – “Ye country comets, that portend / No war nor prince’s funeral” – couldn’t help a lovestruck Andrew Marvell 400 years ago. “Your courteous lights in vain you waste, / Since Juliana here is come, / For she my mind hath so displac’d / That I shall never find my home.”“The Nature of … ” is a column by Helen Sullivan dedicated to interesting animals, insects, plants and natural phenomena.

Mud splats up from the dogs’ paws as we thread the upward path towards Bury Castle hillfort. Below us, just visible through the trees, the apple-dumpling thatched cottages on Selworthy Green begin to twinkle with a tea-time glow.Suddenly, the cosy scene is disturbed by a loud crackle of gunfire. Who is shooting here at this time of day? A second volley echoes in the combe – is it guns or fireworks? A pause – silence – then a heaving crash and the hillside is roiling and bouncing, the earth reverberating, the woodland collapsing on top of us.It stops, and we are unharmed. There’s a gap above showing grey sky, and below on the track is a confused heap of broken branches. An oak has split and toppled, smashing through the undergrowth, bringing down part of a laurel thicket knotted with skeins of bramble.Apple-dumpling cottages in Selworthy Green. Photograph: Sara HudstonThe dogs dash about in wild excitement while I stand still. More rain falls. I should turn back, but I am curious. Has a whole tree come down or only part? Why did it happen now, when there is no wind? Did the roots slip in the saturated earth?Cautiously, I walk forward. It’s difficult to see much because the base of the trunk is hidden in the understorey – I am not going to plunge in and thrash around for clues. I notice that some of the broken limbs are mossed and leafless, with ferns growing out of the bark. It’s likely that the tree was suffering from oak decline, a combination of pests and diseases that weakens and eventually kills. The “shots” I heard must have been the sound of heartwood cracking before the main body gave way.A couple of weeks later, I return to find the fallen timber has been cleared from the path. Gales have swept through since my last visit and the ground is pasted with wet autumn leaves and finger-size fragments of blackened twig.

","['Peter Hannam', ' and ', 'Benita Kolovos']","AGL Energy will shut down Australia’s biggest single carbon polluting power plant a decade earlier than planned, changing the closure date of its coal-fired Loy Yang A power station in Victoria from 2045 to 2035.The company, Australia’s biggest electricity generator and polluter, is accelerating its exit from coal, according to a plan released to the stock exchange on Thursday. The strategy details its transition to renewable energy after opposition from its largest shareholder, billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes, forced it in May to ditch plans to demerge.The company will leave unchanged the plan to shut its Bayswater black coal-fired power station in New South Wales’ Hunter Valley between 2030 and 2033, a statement by AGL to the stock exchange on Thursday showed.AGL predicted it will have the largest portfolio of renewable energy and storage of any listed company in the country. The early closure of Loy Yang A could avoid 200m tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions, the company said.“We have the ambition to supply up to 12 gigawatts of renewable and firming capacity up to 2036 to meet our customer demand, estimated to require up to a $20bn investment,” Patricia McKenzie, the new AGL chair, said in the statement.“Our interim target is to have up to 5GW of new renewables and firming in place by 2030, funding from a combination of assets on AGL’s balance sheet, offtakes and via partnerships – with battery, wind and solar priority investments at this stage,” she said.Confirmation of the earlier closure of the 2,210-megawatt Loy Yang A in the Latrobe Valley comes days after the Victorian government announced ambitious plans to bring in more storage to the power system.

Under the targets, Victoria would reach 2.6 gigawatts of renewable energy storage capacity by 2030 and 6.3GW by 2035 – enough to power about half of Victoria’s current homes at their peak energy usage.The Victorian plant supplies about 30% of the state’s electricity and is the biggest single carbon-polluting plant in the country. Nationally, only Origin Energy’s 2,880MW plant – due to shut in 2025 – is larger.AGL has already shut one of the four units of its Liddell coal-fired power station in the Hunter Valley and will shut the rest of the 1,680MW plant by next April. Bayswater, at 2,640MW, will operate for another six to nine years after Liddell’s closure.Mike Cannon-Brookes to back new AGL board members in bid to clean up climate polluterRead moreInvestors will be looking for how AGL plans to make up for the generation capacity loss with the closure of its three coal-fired power stations. New storage and renewable energy plants are expected to feature in the strategy.Through his family company, Grok Ventures, Cannon-Brookes released a statement on Wednesday afternoon naming four people he wants to join the five-member AGL board.The nominations, along with the recent appointment of renewable energy veteran Miles George as a board member, could give Cannon-Brookes effective control over the future of AGL if they are approved by other shareholders at the company’s annual general meeting planned for 15 November.Grok said the firm welcomed AGL’s strategic review and was “pleased with the board’s commitment to accelerate AGL’s coal plant closures and pivot to capture the major opportunity presented by the renewable energy transition”.“While this is a positive step in the right direction, as the largest emitter, and the leading energy company in Australia, AGL needs to assume a leadership position to achieve a Paris goal of below 1.5C,” a spokesperson said.However, to make sure the board does the right thing, Grok would continue to press for its four nominations to the board of five to be confirmed.“There is a monumental amount of work ahead to become a leading green ‘gentailer’,” the spokesperson said, referring to a generator and retailer.“To achieve this, the board must go further with its renewal – looking to fresh faces to provide a broader mix of skills, experience and capabilities around the table.”Cannon-Brookes, who holds about 11.3% of AGL’s stock and is the largest shareholder, has previously said he wanted AGL to be out of coal by 2035.According to data from the Clean Energy Regulator for 2019-20, the Loy Yang A power station emitted 16.68m tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent, with Bayswater’s pollution topping 14m tonnes CO2-equivalent, the two largest single polluting power plants in the country. Eraring’s emissions totalled 13.2m tonnes CO2-equivalent.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It does not get bigger than this,” said Bruce Mountain, the head of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre.Mountain said it looked like the Victorian government’s storage targets anticipated Loy Yang A’s closure and were consistent with what the Australian Energy Market Operator had modelled.“The big challenge here will be to build the circa 5GW of wind and 5GW of solar needed to fully decarbonise by 2035, which now seems to be the implicit target date,” Mountain said, referring to Victoria’s trajectory.“I don’t see technology or capital constraints,” he said. “The main challenge will be one of coordination and direction.“The foundations have been laid in VicGrid, the Solar Homes program, the Offshore Wind Target and now the Storage Target,” Mountain said. “The task now is to ensure that these are implemented.”The revised closure dates marked “a major step forward in Australia’s decarbonisation journey”, AGL’s interim CEO, Damien Nicks, said. It would also support the achievement of the Paris climate goals of keeping global heating to 1.5-2C.To get there, the company’s existing pipeline of 3.2 gigawatts of new renewables and firming including batteries and pumped hydro would be expanded to 5GW by 2030.Jayne Jagot appointed to Australia’s high court, creating first majority-female benchRead moreVictoria’s energy minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, said she was only informed of AGL’s plans “late last night”.D’Ambrosio said Thursday would “be a difficult day for the AGL workforce, the families and the local communities”.“Our commitment as a state government is to work with every worker to plan for the future,” she told journalists. “[We] will work with AGL to work on plans around transition, around retraining, reskilling and looking at finding opportunities for people to be able to find jobs close to where they live.”She declined to comment on how the earlier closure would affect power prices. AGL’s website notes Loy Yang A produces enough electricity to power 2m home, with the plant’s first units operating since 1984.AGL shares rose almost 3% on Wednesday, contrasting with a 0.5% drop in the overall market. In early trading on Thursday, they initially rose by 2.4% but pared gains to be up 0.9% in recent activity. 0.6%. The overall market was up about 1.8%.",2022-09-29
The goose whisperer: flying high with the wild geese of Norfolk,Nick Acheson has spent many hours studying wild geese. Now he’s written a book about the beauty of these birds and what they can teach us about how to live with nature,['Patrick Barkham'],"It is a grimy, grubby, dank dusk soon after the shortest day of the year. A mizzle prevents any view of anything as Nick Acheson squelches along a muddy seabank beside the Norfolk coast. Suddenly, from the far distance, a faint song pierces the gloom, the sound soaring like a choir singing in a vaulted cathedral. Hundreds of high-pitched voices draw nearer – and this vast, desolate landscape of wet marsh and damp air is animated by a glorious cacophony of pink-footed geese. We still can’t see them in the mist, but several thousand birds pass overhead, on their way to roost on the salt marsh. Acheson looks up and sighs. “They are the souls of winter,” he says. “The sight and the sound and the movement and the comings and the goings of winter – and they connect us with the world.”The spectacle is awesome, free and a rare and precious experience in the modern world: to be a human outnumbered by another species; to witness an abundance of wild birds in one of the most nature-depleted countries on Earth (the UK is ranked 12th worst for “biodiversity intactness” out of 240 countries, according to an RSPB study). Invariably, unfortunately, this experience is threatened by anthropogenic menaces: global heating, avian flu and changing farming practices. And so Acheson is determined to bring wider attention to the wonder of geese.In one sense, he feels an obligation to them. Two winters ago, locked down and alone, the global pandemic having robbed him of employment and family, Acheson, who for years made a living leading wildlife tours around the world, began following the geese. Virtually every day, he cycled 25 miles on his mother’s old red bicycle from his home to the coast and back to seek out not only the pinkfeet, but the brent, barnacle, white-fronted and other even rarer geese that flock here each winter before retreating to the high Arctic in summer.Geese are the sight and the sound and the comings and the goings of winter – and they connect us with the worldNick Acheson“Winter is hard. I’m scrawny, I don’t heat my house,” laughs Acheson, a boyish, enthusiastic naturalist who perpetually interrupts himself to point out the alarm call of a wren or the scent left by a fox. “That winter, my mum had a significant health diagnosis, so I wasn’t allowed near her. I didn’t have any income apart from a day a week’s work with the Norfolk Wildlife Trust. I didn’t know where life was going to go, and I was completely alone, month after month. So the geese were my flock.”He didn’t set out to write a book – “I thought, how am I going to get through this winter? I will write a story about the geese” – but his journal has become The Meaning of Geese, a gorgeously observed paean to the beauty and complexity of these birds, and the landscape of North Norfolk.Acheson grew up here, in a village called Little Snoring. As a boy, he was obsessed with wild animals and inspired to love geese by a teacher, Dave Horsley, who led his school’s bird club.“The world is a jigsaw of understanding,” says Acheson. “You need the first pieces put there for you to start seeing a pattern, and he gave us those pieces. What lives in this landscape? What noise does it make? Where does it come from? He peopled the landscape with what belongs there in an osmotic way. It was so gentle.”Acheson left Norfolk for university and then lived in the Bolivian Amazon for more than a decade. Fluent in Spanish, he travelled the world showing people rare wildlife. “I could have cheerfully lived in South America,” he says. But then, on a trip home to Norfolk, he took a walk on the marshes with an old birdwatching friend. “It was a bright, beautiful winter’s day with wigeon whistling everywhere, and then brent geese, and I thought, this is where I belong, this is where I’m from, this is calling to me.”Birds of a feather: during lockdown Nick Acheson found himself riding 25 miles from his home to the Norfolk coast on his mother’s old red bike. Photograph: Kate Peters/The ObserverHe returned home, but continued to lead wildlife tours abroad until he was struck by a crisis of conscience. “I always sought to do only what I thought was supporting conservation, working with ethical companies who put money into conservation, helping biodiversity on the ground. But the more I read about climate, the more convinced I was that everything we were trying to save by taking people to see it was more threatened by climate change.” So he gave up the foreign tours, renounced flying and embraced “low-carbon birding”. He’s contributed to a book of the same name.“Lots of us birders have talked about our move towards staying local or travelling by land or not twitching.” Twitching – rushing to photograph whatever rare bird flits into Britain – seems to be a dirty word. “No it isn’t,” says Acheson, “because I respect that for some people that’s a way of appreciating nature. For me, I’d rather have a relationship with a place and the things that live in it.”So watching geese via the medium of an old red bike is not an affectation, but why his mum’s bike? “Because it was a bike that was still available to me and in working order.” Lots of people bought flash bikes in lockdown, I say. “No!” Acheson looks appalled. Does that idea horrify him? “Yes. From a consumer point of view, it’s completely ghastly.”As you’d expect from a former tour guide, Acheson has a gift for describing geese, in words and while on our walk. “Pinkfeet are all shrill and excitable and full of stories,” he explains. “It’s a high-pitched sound, but underneath there’s this throbbing purr. Whereas the brent geese are all throaty and chesty – more of an all-consuming sound that rolls through you.” The brent are a particularly pretty goose: dainty with a black head and neck and a white rear end. Then there’s the barnacle goose whose “lustrous black neck embraces its pure white face, like a gloved hand holding a ball”, writes Acheson.Pinkfeet are all shrill and excitable and full of stories. It’s high-pitched, but underneath there’s this throbbing purrNick AchesonHis favourite are the pinkfeet. “They are family animals,” he says. “They pair for life and guide their young in the flocks back to us in the winter, and then stay with them all winter.” The geese were once common on the Norfolk coast, but appear to have been scared away by aerial bombing during the Second World War. By the 1980s they returned, and proliferated thanks to the spread of sugar beet farming – feasting upon beet tops left on fields after harvest. Today, Norfolk’s winter population has retreated from a high of more than 100,000, but 50,000 have been counted at Holkham National Nature Reserve this winter. “You can get 30,000 of them in one field and the sound of them – it reverberates in your chest. It’s a giant noise.”Acheson argues that geese and other wild birds can be enjoyed anywhere. “Right now we can hear 10,000 geese, which is the most extraordinary blessing, but there are geese everywhere.” Canada geese may be treated as pests, but when they settle in town parks “they are the only megafauna that some people might see,” says Acheson. “They are the last shard of a shattered thing and they are precious for that reason. But it doesn’t have to be geese. It can be starlings or pied wagtails roosting in a city street. It can be the blackbird that wakes you up when it starts singing in March. It’s about sensing that we’re dwarfed by this gigantic extraordinary thing that made us and will consume us, and to which we owe respect and space and love. God, look at that…” Acheson is distracted again by a chorus of goose voices. “That is tens of thousands of birds. Every single one of them with a story.”Beyond savouring this spectacle, Acheson, alongside a select band of goose obsessives whom he meets in his book, also seeks the possibility of one rare goose – a red-breasted goose, say – among thousands of pinkfeet. “It’s an immersive thing. Working through a flock of geese you’re absolutely lost, you’re completely focused down the barrel of a telescope for hours sometimes. It’s meditative. And it’s reaching out of our own lives into the lives of something beyond us. They take our Norfolk back with them. They are fed through the winter on the land that I belong to, and they take that with them to the Arctic. It’s almost like our gift. Then they bring back the gift of their abundance. It’s the most humbling thing – Bearded tit!” He points to a misty reed bed where a small bird has made a pinging call. “It’s like a badly tuned triangle.”The abundance of these geese is an everyday wild miracle in southern Britain. Unfortunately, as Acheson reveals, it is also in peril. “I didn’t want to write a relentlessly in-your-face book about climate change, but I wanted to show how much you can engage with the beauty of the wild while being aware of climate change and fearful of the effect it’s going to have on the species that we love,” he says.The smaller I can feel, the better it is. It’s a feeling of wanting to know my placeNick AchesonHe interviews a climate-change professor whose modelling predicts that with a 1.5C temperature rise, the pinkfeet will no longer spend winter in Norfolk. But is this just our loss? Presumably the pinkfeet will adapt and find new food sources as the Arctic melts. “Yes, in Britain it’s our loss. But we can’t assume it will all be OK. Because there are so many feedback loops that spin off from the melting of the tundra. The massive release of methane if we lose the permafrost, which then speeds up the process. All these crazy spirals of climate change. We talk about 1.5C, but it’s 1.5C of failure and denial. People sometimes say to me, ‘What a waste of your time to give up flying,’ but I feel that every gram of carbon that’s not released, every person who is influenced in a positive way, not in an aggressive way or in a holier-than-thou way, but somebody who stops and thinks, that’s a good thing.”There are other threats to the abundance of winter geese: more efficient harvesting means that fewer sugar beet tops are left on the fields for the geese to eat, and now there’s the menace of avian flu, which devastated breeding seabirds along Britain’s northeast coast last year. The virus has yet to rip through the flocks of pinkfeet, but it is surely only a matter of time.And yet our gloomy, misty, chilly walk is wreathed in hope – it seems inherent in the glorious chorus of thousands of geese. Their song does not sound like a lament. Acheson points out that simple tweaks in our farming system could make more space, and food, for them. “We can live alongside these things,” he argues. “We are humans and we have taken control of the landscape right across the world – 96% of mammals on earth by biomass are humans and our livestock. That’s terrifying and yet it doesn’t take much to give them space. That starts with paying attention to them. [Environmentalist] Robin Wall Kimmerer talks about ‘the honourable harvest’. If we’re going to take resources from the wild, at the very least we owe them our attention.”Through paying close attention to wild nature, Acheson, like so many of us, has found solace during difficult times. These geese make him feel small and he revels in it. “The smaller I can feel, the better it is. And that’s not a self-obliterating feeling, it’s a feeling of wanting to know my place, because genetically, the carbon, the genes, everything that makes me and you and us is part of this enormous flow, and these geese are a sacrament of that.”The Meaning of Geese by Nick Acheson (Chelsea Green, £20) is published on 9 February",2023-01-28

LettersThe Ordnance Survey map change that put horse riders in danger,"The OS decision that bridleways were obsolete is a typical example of discrimination against riders, says Catriona Cook",['Letters'],"The campaigners that your article refers to are right (Give horse riders equal access to English woodlands, say campaigners, 12 August). There is another example of the government’s discrimination against riders in the article (12 August) on Alfred Wainwright’s coast-to-coast walk being made a National Trail – yet another facility only for walkers.But it was ever thus. In 1946, the Ordnance Survey decided that bridle roads had been used by packhorse trains, which were no longer in use, rendering bridleways obsolete. It gave a directive that the letters BR, standing for bridle road, were to be replaced by the letters FP for footpath on the 2.5in OS maps. This had the effect of removing safe off-road routes, forcing later generations of riders and cyclists to risk their lives on the roads.It is time for the the government to practise what it preaches with regard to public facilities being fully inclusive for all – to allow riders free access to Forestry Commission woods, to include riders under the walking and cycling strategy, and to give a directive to all landholding public bodies to upgrade footpaths to bridleways and to dedicate new ones, to enable all to have safe off-road exercise facilities.Catriona CookScarborough, North Yorkshire Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

 This article is more than 1 month oldSunak accused of trying to ‘reset’ climate credentials at Cop28This article is more than 1 month old,British PM to tell UN summit of plans for rainforests and new national park – but green groups remain sceptical,"['Helena Horton', ' Environment reporter']","Rishi Sunak is to announce a new package of green measures as the Cop28 UN climate summit begins in Dubai, including a search for a national park, a strategy on British rainforests and landscape recovery projects with farmers.But green groups have told the Guardian the package is greenwashing and an attempt by the UK prime minister to “reset” his reputation after previously opposing environmental measures.Craig Bennett, the chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts, said: “There is very little indication that voters responded well to his anti-green spasm a few months ago.”The measures to be announced on Wednesday will include a countrywide search for the location for a national park in England. The government said it would be in one of England’s “most beautiful” nature spots, and chosen with accessibility for everyone in mind.It is unlikely, however, that the government can begin to fulfil that pledge before the next general election.Sunak will also propose a £15m boost in funding for existing parks and nationally important nature spaces, and a rainforest strategy with £750,000 for research. There will also be £2.5m to improve access to nature for children, though there was no detail on how this would be achieved.There is scepticism among environmental groups about the motivations for the announcement. Some news outlets reported that Sunak’s popularity had dived after he revealed a rollback of net zero measures in September, a strategy he thought would boost the party after the Uxbridge byelection, in which a supposed backlash against the Ulez emissions scheme was credited with playing a critical role.Sunak is due to attend Cop28 this week with the foreign secretary, David Cameron, and King Charles III. The prime minister made a firm commitment to attend the summit early this year after a last-minute U-turn on Cop27 in Egypt last year. No 10 had previously said he was too focused on the domestic economy to attend the 2022 conference and banned the king from going.Bennett said there was “good reason to believe Sunak is trying to reset his image”.He added: “Polls show climate and nature feature very high in voters’ concerns – above immigration, according to some polling – so it’s not a surprise that Rishi Sunak will be trying to tack back to those voters. It is also worth noting that there are many environmental promises the government has not delivered, such as releasing beavers, banning peat sales and the deposit return scheme.”Kevin Bishop, the chief executive of Dartmoor National Park Authority, said before the government announces a new park, it should be properly funding existing ones.Since the Conservative party came to power in 2010, national parks had experienced budget cuts that led to the closure of visitor centres, he said. Many were in a poor state for nature as they were overgrazed by livestock and otherwise poorly maintained.Bishop added: “The priority should be about funding the existing national parks. During the age of austerity, which for us has not ended, our core funding in real terms has been cut by 50%. The announcement does include additional money for existing national parks, which will not cover what has been cut but is welcome.

This is the area of the environment land management schemes that has been oversubscribed and has such potential for nature that to roll this out further will make a difference. The rainforest strategy also will be welcome, depending on what it contains.”The prime minister said he shared in the country’s “profound sense of anger” over the felling of the world-famous Sycamore Gap tree, near Hadrian’s Wall in Northumberland, in September “but the public’s outrage fundamentally demonstrated just how much love the British people have for the natural world”.He added: “From Yorkshire’s historic rolling moors to ancient rainforest on the Cornish coast, we are home to many globally significant landscapes. We must do all it takes to protect these much-loved spaces and ensure that love for the natural world continues into the next generations.“As I head to Cop28, we are reasserting the UK’s leading role in promoting our iconic landscapes and keeping nature at the centre of our action to tackle climate change.”",2023-11-29
Mafia mussel: the fight to save a mollusc from the mob,"As poaching of date mussels wrecks Naples’ reefs, police joined biologists to find the gangs behind it","['Seascape: the state of our oceans is supported by', 'About this content', 'Agostino Petroni']","After a three-year investigation into two organised crime groups in Italy’s Campania region that included wire taps, surveillance and nearly 100 suspects, police cracked down with a dozen arrests in March – not for offences linked to drugs or prostitution, but for the illegal harvesting of a small mollusc.Known as date mussels, Lithophaga lithophaga are cigar-shaped shellfish that make their homes inside limestone, secreting an acid that slowly carves out a tunnel in the rock. They take decades to grow – anywhere from 18 to 36 years to reach just 5cm in length – and can live for more than 50 years.But it takes just a few seconds, using sledgehammers or explosives, to pry them loose – devastating the marine environment in the process. Date-mussel fisheries are regarded by scientists as one of the world’s most destructive practices in marine habitats; ecosystems can take more than 50 years to recover from the damage.An Italian police diver with a date mussel illegally taken off Capri’s Faraglioni rocks. Photograph: Italian finance police/Reuters“What’s left after a date mussel harvest is a moon-like landscape: white rocks without any life form left on them,” says Giovanni Fulvio Russo, president of the Italian Society of Marine Biology.As a result, fishing for or selling date mussels is illegal in the EU. But date mussels are a revered delicacy in Italy, regarded by some people as an aphrodisiac. On the black market 1kg (2.2lb) can fetch up to €200 (£170).That has attracted shady operators – and has in turn led to the destruction of much of the rocky reefs along the renowned Amalfi coast and the sea stacks of Capri, where so far nearly half of underwater sea walls have been attacked by hammering and explosives. Although Italian police have been seizing mussels and fining poachers for 30 years, gathering mussels was long considered as merely a misdemeanour, with no threat of prison sentences, and leaving poachers free to continue their destructive harvesting.The fact that the mussel is banned has led to gangsters treating it as a status symbol, serving it to demonstrate powerMuch of the threat comes from organised crime groups. A few families oversee the poaching and trade of date mussels, according to Giulio Vanacore, an environmental prosecutor at the Naples public prosecution office. They sell some of the mussels to fish shops, restaurants, pizzerias and Italy’s elite, but prosecutors say some of the core clients are the camorristi, members of the Neapolitan mafia, the Camorra. The very fact that the mussel is banned has led to some gangsters treating it as a status symbol, serving it during celebrations to demonstrate their power.Date mussels have also been part of southern Italian gastronomic culture since ancient Roman times. People would walk to the shore with a hammer to extract a few mussels for dinner. Towards the end of the 20th century, however, the deterioration of the reef had become visible.Algae, crustaceans and any other life forms attached to the rock die from the violent extraction process. Debris settles on the seafloor, eroding it and creating oxygen-free “dead zones”. It is estimated that the illegal harvest of date mussels by a single fisherman can destroy up to 2,400 sq metres of seabed.“It’s as though to harvest mushrooms, gatherers would uproot the whole forest that took hundreds of years to grow,” says Marco Sacchi, a geologist at Napoli Institute of Marine Science (Ismar), who was hired by the Naples public prosecution office to investigate the damage done by the illegal harvest. The hammering and bombing can cause rock faces underwater to fracture and eventually collapse, which also endangers manmade infrastructure above the waves, he points out.Russo studied the harvesting’s collateral damage to local ecosystems, collecting evidence of widespread destruction along the Sorrento peninsula and Amalfi coast, which led the Italian government to ban fishing for date mussels in 1988.A rock in the Punta Campanella marine reserve, Italy, covered with yellow cluster anemone. A rock in the same reserve after date mussels have been gouged out of it. It can take 50 years for rocks to regain the plant and animal life it once had. Photograph: Franco Banfi“I looked for areas in pristine condition, a place that had not been fished, but I couldn’t find any,” says Russo. He says the entire Amalfi coast, Positano peninsula and the island of Capri have been damaged. Since date mussels take so long to grow, divers simply move on to the next spot, as if following a vein of silver. Marine life on the rock face can take decades to regenerate, even in ideal conditions.“When you scuba dive in places where the datterari [poachers] came by, you go back to the boat, and you mourn as if somebody died,” says Gianluigi Di Maio, the owner of Punta Campanella Diving, which runs diving tours. Many of his favourite dive spots have been destroyed, he says. “The problem is that there are not that many of us who go underwater. Damage is perpetrated constantly, but nobody talks about it because the deterioration is not visible to the public.”Some local people have tried to fight back. Antonino Miccio, the director of the Punta Campanella marine protected area, at the southern end of the Bay of Naples, persuaded some restaurateurs not to buy or serve date mussels. But he has received several threats over the years, and in 2010 poachers destroyed one of the most beautiful areas inside the marine reserve. “I am sure they did it as revenge,” Miccio says.His complaints to prosecutors mostly fell on deaf ears, but in 2018 Giulio Vanacore, a 37-year-old magistrate who had recently joined the environment section of the Naples public prosecution office, opened an investigation.Vanacore based his approach on Italy’s 2015 Ecodelitti law , which made environmental and pollution crimes punishable by up to 15 years in prison.“I had the idea that we should not punish only individual instances of the sale, holding or extraction of date mussels, because these actions hid a larger criminal process,” Vanacore says. “This is why I started investigations for felonies of environmental and pollution crimes.”The Faraglioni rocks off Capri, where the seabed has been devastated by the illegal collection of date mussels. Photograph: Yara Nardi/ReutersHis investigation took three years, and involved not just the wire taps and surveillance of suspects traditionally used in fighting organised crime, but scientific studies and environmental assessment reports showing the ecological damage from the alleged crimes. This culminated in a 1,100-page report that traced every step of the criminal business and named more than 100 people, from harvesters to restaurant owners.In March, the Naples public prosecution office issued arrest warrants that led to the detention of 12 suspects. If convicted, some of them could face several years in prison.“Now we have the tools, and we need to use them. Otherwise, all the work we are doing will be useless,” Vanacore says. “We’ll keep on doing our job to try to protect our environment from being destroyed by criminals.”",2019-02-02
"Country diary: hare today, and tomorrow","Allendale, Northumberland: Soon these ‘mad’ hares will be less wary as their mating instincts take over. Then the males will chase the females full pelt through these upland fields","['Susie White', '@cottagegardener']","We saw their tracks in the February snow, sensing energy in the mass of overlaying prints. Swirling, twisting and doubling back, they were evidence that brown hares, Lepus europaeus, had been having some wild party. Now, with the snow gone, I have to rely on sightings to know what they are up to, but brown hares are clever at hiding themselves, even out in the open.I watch one crossing the field. Every time the hare pauses, it stops beside a clump of dead thistles. Without seeing it move, I would never spot it among the dull stalks and the faded rushes. Sometimes it flattens down, camouflaged as a molehill or a heap from the muckspreader.Another hare streaks across the grass, legs at full stretch like a brooch. It gives a little skip, sees me and stands on its back legs, front paws dangling, black-tipped ears twitching back and forth, before effortlessly leaping the stone wall and disappearing into the wood.They have already started some tentative boxing. By mid-March, “mad” hares will be less wary as their mating instincts take over. Then the males will chase the females full pelt through these upland fields, racing between peewits and curlews.When a doe has had enough, she will spin round and ferociously pummel a male with her powerful front paws. He’ll respond and the sight of hares – sometimes two competing males – standing on hind legs, beating at each other, tufts of fur flying, is one of the sights of spring.With their top speed of 40 mph, it’s exhilarating to watch a hare sprinting round the perimeter of this wide field like an athlete on a racetrack. Once the spring fever is over, it will be harder to spot, lying up by day in a “form” – a small depression hidden in the meadow. Leverets are born fully furred and with eyes open.For the first month, they are left in separate forms a few metres from where they were born as safety from predators. They gather only at sunset to be fed. So it was with joy last July that I watched two leverets nuzzling their mother, skipping round her and playing through the tall backlit summer grasses.

 Draft EU policy to cut shipping emissions condemned as ‘disaster’,"Exclusive: leak reveals law promotes liquified natural gas and will lock in fossil fuel use for decades, says NGO",['Daniel Boffey'],"A leaked draft of a key EU policy designed to cut carbon emissions in shipping, one of the world’s biggest polluters, has been described as an environmental disaster for “promoting” liquified natural gas, a fossil fuel, as an alternative to heavy oil.The decision, says an NGO that has analysed the plans, will ‘lock in the use of fossil fuels for decades to come and make the EU’s target of net emissions neutrality by 2050 unreachable.The green fuel law for EU shipping – FuelEU Maritime – is due to be published on 14 July. But a draft of the policy seen by the Guardian reveals the European Commission has considered but rejected requiring specific green fuels to be used by shipowners.Brussels has instead opted for a goal-based approach that would set increasingly stringent “greenhouse gas intensity targets” to be met for the energy used on board.The commission’s leaked paper says this approach, rather than a “prescriptive” fuel regulation, “answers the needs for flexibility, which have been stressed by stakeholders during the consultation activities” (in particular operators and ports). The commission cites the fast pace of technological developments as a factor in its decision.Of the 136 responses to a consultation, 121 were either shipowners or ship managers, energy producers and fuel suppliers, short sea shipping companies, shipbuilding and marine equipment manufacturers or logistics suppliers, shippers and cargo owners.The result, environmental groups claim, is that liquified natural gas (LNG) would be eligible to power EU ships calling at the union’s ports until around 2040, and that fossil fuel would probably still be the cheapest compliance option for two decades.The sustainable transport NGO, Transport and Environment (T&E), has studied the plans closely and argues the decision will lock in the use of fossil fuels, in the form of LGN, for decades and make the EU’s target of net emissions neutrality by 2050 unreachable.The “flexible” policy, it is claimed by T&E, will encourage price-sensitive shipowners to opt for LNG ships as the cheaper solution over zero-emissions fuels such as green hydrogen or ammonia. Shipowners will then be locked in to using them for another 30 years, the average lifetime of a ship.More than half (55%) of the energy used by ships calling at EU ports could be LGN and “unsustainable” biodiesel, derived from biomass such as plant or algae material or animal waste, by 2035, it is claimed.T&E, which first obtained the leaked policy draft, claims most LNG-powered ships emit more greenhouse gas than heavy fuel oil ships.Faig Abbasov, the NGO’s shipping programme director, said the commission still had time to change the policy to explicitly exclude fossil LNG and first-generation biofuels from the scope of the regulation.He said: “This supposedly green fuels law would push the cheapest alternatives, which are also the most destructive.“Counting fossil gas and biofuels as green will lock shipping into decades of further pollution while we should be promoting carbon-free, renewable hydrogen and ammonia. There’s still time to kick out fossil fuels and stop the European Green Deal turning shipping’s transition into an ecological disaster.”The EU has set a target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 and becoming climate neutral by 2050, requiring a 90% reduction in transport emissions by 2050.The commission’s aim is for renewable and low-carbon fuels representing between 6% and 9% of the international maritime transport fuel mix in 2030 and 86% and 88% by 2050.A European Commission spokesperson declined to comment on the leaked policy document, but said: “Air and maritime transport have significant decarbonisation challenges in the next decades, due to the current lack of market ready zero-emission technologies, long development and life cycles of aircraft and vessels, the significant investments required in refuelling equipment and infrastructure, and international competition in these sectors.“EU international emissions from navigation and aviation have grown by more than 50% since 1990. Action in these sectors is urgently needed, including as they recover from the current crisis, and we will make proposals as part of our ‘Fit for 55 Package’ to address these challenges.“The ReFuelEU Aviation and FuelEU Maritime initiatives are intended to boost the production and uptake of sustainable aviation and maritime fuels.”The industry is also understood to have concerns over the sustainability of biofuels mandated for use but has been broadly supportive of the draft regulation’s flexibility.Claes Berglund, the president of the European Community Shipowners’ Associations, said: “The European shipping sector is committed to decarbonise the shipping industry as quickly as possible. However, shipowners cannot be held accountable for the quality of fuels. This is the sole responsibility of fuel suppliers.”",2021-06-23
How to use up old bread in a vegan Milanese – recipe,"If you think bread that’s past its best is fit only for the birds, think again. Stale bread can be one of the most useful of all ingredients",['Tom Hunt'],"Stale bread is one of the most useful of all ingredients. Once properly dried out, it keeps for years and can be upcycled into all manner of delicious dishes from an exotic fattoush to Danish brødtorte (a cake made from stale rye bread). Here, I’m transforming an old knob of spelt sourdough into a vegan take on Milanese. It’s traditionally made by dipping thin cuts of floured meat (chicken, beef, pork or veal, say) into egg and breadcrumbs, much like Austrian schnitzel, but I’m using aubergine steaks and the aquafaba from a tin of chickpeas. The wholemeal bread adds lots of flavour to the dish, but of course any breadcrumbs will do, really.Aubergine milaneseThis simple recipe transforms a stale knob of bread, some chickpea water and an aubergine into a delicious family meal; the leftovers are also incredible in a sandwich, especially if topped with aquafaba mayonnaise, pickled chillies, salad leaves and pureed chickpeas. This recipe calls for aquafaba, or chickpea water, which means in this instance the chickpeas themselves become a byproduct. Save them for another use, or make a mash to go alongside your Milanese: gently warm them up in a saucepan, stirring often, then mash coarsely and dress with extra-virgin olive oil, lime or lemon juice, and zest to taste.1 large aubergine120g stale bread, or breadcrumbs1 tsp dried oregano or thyme (optional)2 tbsp nutritional yeast (optional)The aquafaba from 1 x 400g tin chickpeas1 large aubergineSea saltBuckwheat, wholewheat or plain flour, for dusting – you’ll need 2-3 tbsp in all2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oilTo serve (all optional)Hot mashed chickpeasWatercressAquafaba mayonnaiseLemon or lime wedgesBlend the old bread into fine breadcrumbs, mix in the optional dried herbs or nutritional yeast, then tip into a wide bowl. Pour the chickpea liquid into another bowl.Cut the aubergine lengthways into four thick steaks and lay these on a baking tray. Season with salt, then dust lightly on both sides with flour, shaking off any excess. Dip the aubergine steaks one at a time in the aquafaba, to coat, then allow any excess to drip off. Lay the steaks one by one in the breadcrumbs and and turn to coat all over.Put the extra-virgin olive oil in a large frying pan on a medium heat, then lay in the breaded aubergine – don’t overcrowd the pan, so use two frying pans, if need be. Leave to fry, flipping once, until golden brown on both sides, then serve with optional mashed chickpeas, watercress, aquafaba mayonnaise and lemon or lime wedges.",2023-10-28
 This article is more than 7 months oldWeather tracker: power prices dip to negative in Europe amid clean energy boostThis article is more than 7 months old,Low demand combined with sunny conditions and meltwater lifts hydro and solar production,['Theo Gkousarov (Metdesk)'],"Over the last week, several European countries had power prices in the wholesale energy market dip into negative values during daylight hours. The decline in prices was mostly driven by the abundance of available energy generated by renewable sources, combined with the relatively low demand for energy for heating or cooling, caused by normal springtime temperatures.Negative prices often occur when there is an excess supply of electricity in the market. This can happen when renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, or hydro produce a large quantity of electricity that exceeds demand and cannot be stored for later use. In such cases, producers may offer negative prices to incentivise wholesale consumers to take the surplus electricity off the grid and avoid overloading the system. This situation occurred due to an area of high pressure dominating across much of central and north-west Europe, providing lots of solar power generation across the area. Meanwhile, Finland experienced an oversupply of hydroelectric power resulting from excessive springtime meltwater, which in turn led to negative prices here as well.High pressure will remain positioned over Britain and Ireland through the rest of this week and most of next week, leading to predominantly dry and settled conditions across much of the UK, central and northern Europe. Plenty of sunshine is expected, potentially leading to further opportunities for low or negative prices during the daylight hours. Spring-time school holidays including half-term in the UK and Whitsuntide in Germany have pushed many families to take their kids closer to the Mediterranean to enjoy some warmth and the seaside. Nevertheless, areas of low pressure will drive the development of showers and some thunderstorms across popular European resorts, some of these heavy with the risk of frequent lightning and surface flooding.Over in the western Pacific, Typhoon Mawar has reduced in strength to a category 3 typhoon. Now situated south-east of Taiwan in the Philippine Sea, Mawar’s current projections forecast the typhoon to continue to degrade while veering to the north-east before dissipating by the weekend. While unlikely, the greatest forecast error suggests Mawar could skim the north-east of Taiwan, bringing blustery conditions to the island.",2023-06-01
 This article is more than 3 months oldMinority communities are edged out of the UK’s green spaces. I’m trying to change thatThis article is more than 3 months oldHaroon Mota,"You might think that nature, being free, is available to all – but there are huge racial disparities in access to the outdoorsHaroon Mota is a mountaineer and the founder of Muslim Hikers",,"The British countryside is often perceived as universally accessible, a tranquil escape open for all to enjoy. But is this truly the case? From my experience as a member of and advocate for minority communities in the UK, it has become increasingly evident that time in the natural world is far less accessible to some of us than we would hope.I’ve been adventuring in the outdoors for nearly 20 years now, and from the very beginning I noticed that I wouldn’t bump into people like myself in rural spaces, despite my city being very diverse.One might think that nature, being free, is available to all. But free isn’t enough when we consider the barriers faced by minority communities. Geographical limitations are often the first hurdle: most minority communities are based in urban areas, making it an endeavour both in terms of time and resources to travel to rural areas. A recent study showed the whitest areas of the country enjoy an astounding 144% more local footpaths than the most ethnically diverse.When the pandemic hit, I sensed there was an opportunity to start improving the diversity in our rural spaces, while tackling loneliness and connecting communities at the same time. I founded Muslim Hikers, a global movement that is now the largest community in the world for Muslims interested in the outdoors. What started as an online community quickly grew to include walking events, where we meet up and enjoy these spaces together.We set out to normalise these activities for underrepresented communities like ours, because barriers to accessing rural spaces are just the tip of the iceberg. Cultural norms can also play a significant role in deterring minority groups from engaging with the outdoors. In communities where outdoor activities have not been traditionally emphasised, there’s a lack of knowledge about where to go, what to wear and how to prepare for something like a hike or camping trip. This absence of knowhow becomes self-perpetuating, preventing new generations from developing a relationship with the natural world.View image in fullscreen‘Organisations like Muslim Hikers (above, on a trip to Malham Cove, North Yorkshire), while geared towards specific communities, are promoting wider diversity in the outdoors.’ Photograph: Muslim HikersMoreover, there’s the overarching issue of not seeing oneself reflected in the outdoor community. From advertisements to social media, the faces we see enjoying green spaces often don’t reflect the diversity of our communities. This lack of representation discourages people from feeling as if they belong in these spaces, and it is further worsened by experiences of overt racism and Islamophobia – a reality our organisation knows all too well.The consequences are manifold. Multiple studies show that exposure to nature significantly boosts mental and physical wellbeing. Lack of access to these health benefits is a societal failure that disproportionately affects minority communities. This disparity is not just a niche “outdoorsy” issue: it is a public health issue.A situation in which only some people see nature as “theirs” diminishes our collective stewardship of these vital ecosystems. A person who has never felt the tranquillity of a forest, the grandeur of a mountain, or the vastness of an open field is less likely to advocate for the protection of these spaces.So what can be done? We must tackle this problem at both macro and micro levels. Policy changes need to be enacted that ensure equitable access to public footpaths and green spaces, especially in urban areas. Public transport routes to green spaces need to be improved and subsidised for lower-income households.Community-driven initiatives can also have an immediate impact. Organisations like ours, while geared towards specific communities, are promoting wider diversity in the outdoors. By organising group events that educate individuals on outdoor preparedness and etiquette, these initiatives are making the countryside more approachable and enjoyable for everyone, regardless of their ethnic or cultural background.Public bodies and private companies must also take responsibility. Whether it’s outdoor brands showcasing more diversity in their advertising or local councils investing in accessible, safe, well-maintained footpaths, it’s high time the outdoors became truly inclusive.While the British countryside may be open in theory, it is not, in practice, open to everyone. If we aim to cherish the universality of nature’s beauty, we must make it universally accessible, too.

","['Supported by', 'About this content', 'Natasha May', '@natasha__may']","Farmers have been left reeling by “devastating” losses of livestock and machinery amid severe flooding in south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales, with concern some may not be able to recover from the latest disaster.Paul Weir, a Lismore dairy farmer, could only watch as half of his 300-cow herd were swept away by flood waters in the early hours of Monday morning.“As the water came up they started like a crowd crush and popped a gate open,” Weir said.What caused the ‘rain bomb’?

It is too early to tell how much livestock has been washed away and the damage to equipment and infrastructure under water.One surviving cow is gaining online notoriety after washing up at Duranbah beach in Tweed Heads, while another was seen on a roof in Lismore.

Matt Dalgleish, an agricultural analyst for Thomas Elder Markets, said the combined estimate of cattle in the regions affected by flooding would amount to about 475,000, or about 2% of the national herd, according to Australian Bureau of Statistics calculations.Dalgleish said an estimated 600,000 head of cattle had been lost in the flooding in far north Queensland in 2019 but the impact of this year’s flooding would depend on how widespread it was in cattle regions.Shaughn Morgan, the co-chief executive of eastAUSmilk, the industry body representing dairy farmers in NSW and Queensland, said even dairy farmers whose cattle hadn’t been washed away were facing problems.Without power, milking sheds could not be operated, he said, and cows could develop mastitis, three-day sickness or lameness. “These are issues that need to be addressed quickly,” he said.Infrastructure losses will be ‘enormous’. Photograph: Australian defence force/AFP/Getty ImagesMorgan said flooding was also making it difficult for milk tankers to get to farms, with some stuck on highways.There had been “enormous” infrastructure losses including tractors, sheds, fencing, generators and irrigation equipment, as well as feed.Weir said he had lost everything. He estimates the water damage bill to be $1.5m and expects to miss out on $180,000 in income a month.“We’re in trouble the next three or four months,” he said. “I don’t know how Lismore is going to get over this. Every business in Lismore has been devastated. The people we would normally take these things to get repaired are cleaning up and repairing their own businesses.”Morgan said: “Farmers need to be able to stay on the land. We need to make sure we don’t lose them.”Paul Shoker, the chair of NSW Farmers’ Coffs Harbour branch, said the latest flooding could prove too much for some in the industry.He said the region, which is a major producer of macadamias and blueberries, had experienced significant crop damage, waterlogged paddocks, landslips, lost livestock and damaged fences.Shoker said his phone hadn’t stopped ringing with reports of damage from members since the area received 640mm of rain – more than 40% of their annual rainfall – in six days.Farmers would attempt to salvage damaged crops but some plants would not recover as the waterlogging created fungus and disease.Shoker, a banana and avocado farmer, said he had lost 300 avocado trees in the floods in March last year, a 10th of his total. While it was hard at this stage to assess the damage, he now expected “significant losses” of at least the same magnitude.Farmers who were constantly being squeezed on prices did not have a buffer to cover increasingly frequent bad seasons, he said.

So much so, the punters at the Marrickville golf club have joked they may as well strike a deal with Sea World and put shark cages on the greens.With two months to go until the end of the year, the Marrickville course has received more than double its annual average rainfall – placing it among six Sydney locations in the country’s Top 10 for above-average falls.Marrickville groundskeeper Wayne “Rocky” Beckhaus is not surprised. By 25 October, the Bureau of Meteorology had recorded 2,154mm of rain in the club’s gauge – 213.1% of its annual mean of 1,010.8mm.Now 63, Beckhaus lives in the club’s cottage after growing up playing the course and tending its greens most his working life. His dad, Merv, 88, still regularly plays there.“In all the years I’ve been here, I’ve never seen it like this,” he says. “I’ve seen floods, OK, the river’s broken its banks, sure, but I’ve never seen it this way.”Groundskeeper Wayne Beckhaus at Marrickville golf course.

 Elon Musk’s Tesla lobbied UK to raise tax on petrol and diesel,Electric carmaker’s submission to the government said grants for battery powered cars could be revenue-neutral,"['Jasper Jolly', '@jjpjolly']","Elon Musk’s Tesla lobbied the UK government to raise taxes on petrol and diesel cars in order to fund bigger subsidies for electric vehicles, alongside a ban on hybrids.The US electric car pioneer called for a rise in fuel duty and a charge on petrol and diesel car purchases to pay for grants and tax breaks such as a VAT exemption for battery-powered cars, according to submissions to the government seen by the Guardian.The proposals would theoretically add thousands of pounds to the cost of a new petrol or diesel car, while making electric cars cheaper.“Supporting zero-emissions vehicle uptake via mechanisms to make new fossil-fuelled cars pay for the damage they cause is entirely reasonable and logical,” Tesla wrote in a submission in July last year. “The result can be a revenue-neutral system for the government.”Higher taxes on fossil fuels are seen by many environmental campaigners as a key part of tackling the climate crisis. However, governments fearful of a political backlash such as France’s gilets jaunes (yellow vests) protests have proven reluctant to raise short-term costs for drivers. In the UK the Conservative government has frozen fuel duty for 11 years, a subsidy for petrol and diesel that has been worth more than £50bn.Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, has pioneered mass production of electric vehicles to tackle carbon emissions from transport, although the company’s purchase of $1.5bn (£1.1bn) in bitcoin has been criticised by some environmental campaigners because of the cryptocurrency’s high energy use.Tesla’s views on fossil fuel bans set it at odds with many of its rivals in the car industry, which have lobbied intensely against government proposals to ban all petrol and diesel cars, including hybrids, in 2030. In November the government said hybrids would be allowed until 2035, a relief to many traditional carmakers which still make large profits from fossil fuel engines.Tesla was the only carmaker in the submissions reviewed by the Guardian which argued in favour of a total ban on all petrol and diesel cars, including a ban by 2032 on hybrids, which combine batteries with an internal combustion engine. That would be in line with the UK’s Committee on Climate Change, which said hybrids should be banned in 2032.Research by InfluenceMap, a lobbying monitor, found that carmakers “opposing higher climate ambition” have met the UK government more often than those that generally supported a faster transition. Between 2017 and 2020 the government met those opposed 209 times, compared with 153 for more supportive companies.Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDeskTesla argued that £3,000 grants for new electric cars could be “revenue-neutral” at about £49 per petrol or diesel car sold in 2019. However, that would have to rise to about £750 per petrol or diesel car once electric car market share reached 20%. Grants would directly benefit Tesla sales.Tesla also argued that car manufacturers should be forced to sell a certain proportion of zero-emission vehicles – a “zero-emissions mandate” similar to the company’s home state of California. Other proposals included paying people to switch away from older polluting vehicles, tax breaks for corporate car users, and a “charging promise” that the government would install chargers on any street in the UK when requested.Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.",2021-03-16
How to turn spent corn cobs into a delicious jelly or spread – recipe,"This recipe dates back about 150 years, and has found new life as a delicious, plant-based alternative to honey",['Tom Hunt'],"This dish is a marriage of the old and the new. In an article called Jelly for Scrimpers in South Dakota magazine, Laura Johnson Andrews suggests that corn cob jelly most likely originated in about 1875, when settlers began canning jellies, pickles and preserves, including some delicious-sounding pear, cherry and peach pickles. Spent corn cobs are boiled with sugar and set with pectin to create a wildly delicious sweet jelly that is gorgeous spread on toast, pancakes or waffles. I particularly like it with cheese, especially when the jelly’s spiked with jalapeño.Because of its similarities in appearance at least, some pioneers of the plant-based world have adopted this frugal recipe as an alternative to honey, using a little less pectin to stop the syrup from setting, and to give it a honey-like viscosity. Historically, corn cob jelly has also been used in place of corn syrup, because it’s almost identical in flavour.Corn cob jelly (AKA vegan hot honey)This recipe turns a few spent corn cobs into a delicious sweet treat. It doesn’t matter if there are a few kernels left on the cobs – they will only add flavour and help turn the liquid into a glorious golden yellow. To give the appearance of honey, I’ve added a little optional turmeric, but it does impart some flavour, so add it only if you like the stuff.I strain the cob cooking liquid to create a clear, honey-like substance, but if you wish, add some corn kernels to the jelly mix before jarring, which both looks pretty and adds a wonderful texture. The syrup will keep in the fridge for a couple of weeks.Makes 1 300ml jar4 spent corn cobs1 jalapeño chilli (optional but recommended)¼ lemon300g unrefined jam sugar¼ tsp turmeric (optional)Put the spent corn cobs, jalapeño, if using, and lemon in a deep pan, and add cold water to cover. Bring up to a boil, then turn down the heat to low and leave to simmer for an hour.Lift out and reserve the poached chilli, then strain 300ml of the cooking liquid through a muslin-lined sieve and into a second saucepan. Add the jam sugar and turmeric, if using, then drop in the reserved chilli, turn on the heat to medium and bring to a boil, stirring all the while. Boil for five minutes, still stirring constantly, then pour into a large clean jar. Store in the fridge for a couple of weeks.",2023-09-23
‘We make nature here’: pioneering Dutch project repairs image after outcry over starving animals ,"Oostvaardersplassen reserve reshaped conservation in the 1980s as nature was allowed to take its course, now it is rewilding in a more managed way

","['Wild world is supported by', 'About this content', 'Phoebe Weston', '@phoeb0']","We are in a 4x4 driving through long grass on a bit of land that was once at the bottom of the North Sea. Drained in 1968, this landscape forms part of the world’s largest artificial island, home to Oostvaardersplassen, one of Europe’s most controversial and influential rewilding projects.Herds of free-ranging horses, white-tailed eagles, cattle egrets, high-speed trains, planes, powerlines, wind turbines and the city skyline of Almere all fit in a single frame. It is 7,500 hectares (18,500 acres), roughly the size of Manhattan, and 30 minutes’ drive from Amsterdam. Everything you can see is less than 50 years old.Like beavers, the Dutch dried out this land by building a huge network of dams. The site is up to five metres below sea level, flanked by miles of intensive, flat farmland and two new cities. Hans-Erik Kuypers, the park ranger who is showing us around the reserve, turns off the engine and birdsong enfolds us.Link to the Wild world seriesIt is sometimes referred to as the Dutch Serengeti, and there is a cacophony of rare meadow birds – bluethroat, reed warbler, willow warbler and Cetti’s warbler – all belting out their song. Two weeks ago there was a hoopoe. The wildlife sounds grateful for this little slice of manufactured wilderness. “You could imagine people thinking there’s nothing here,” says Kuypers. “It’s about listening, not looking.”In the flat distance are little black spots that look like mites but are herds of cows and deer. These herbivores are acting as ecological tools, helping maintain vast wetlands and grasslands that support these rare birds.We pass through a herd of about 250 Konik horses busily trying to attack and mate with each other. Open cuts are testament to the power struggle. Males are not castrated, because it is believed that testosterone is key to creating these interesting group dynamics. “Everything that happens here is a play for dominance and reproduction. They need to express their natural behaviour,” says Kuypers.Konik horses ‘need to express their natural behaviour’. Photograph: Judith Jockel/The GuardianThis herd of horses is alive and healthy, but many of their predecessors here starved to death or were shot. Oostvaardersplassen was embroiled in scandal after thousands of cows, horses and deer died during the winter of 2017-18 because the founders of the project believed that nature should govern, and starving to death was considered a natural form of population control.Numbers fell from 5,200 to 1,850 that winter, with 90% of animals shot before they starved to death. There was widespread outrage and the founders received death threats. “It was a terrible time,” says Kuypers.Quick GuideRewilding: what is it?ShowWhat is rewilding?Rewilding is the restoration of nature in places altered by human activity. From releasing apex predators such as jaguars and wolves to making space for native grasslands in urban areas, rewilding can happen on a big or small scale. While there are competing definitions, most have the rebuilding of sustainable ecological health at their core, be it the return of kelp forests on the Sussex coast in England or the reintroduction of mockingbirds on the Galápagos Islands.Why has the term become so popular?Rewilding has captured the public's imagination by being an environmental movement and a science-based process at the same time. With visions of a wilder planet, high-profile environmentalists such as David Attenborough and George Monbiot inspired millions with paths to a more biodiverse, ecologically healthy future. The success of rewilding pioneers around the world has shown what is possible: from the restoration of Gorongosa national park in Mozambique after the civil war to the Knepp estate in the south of England. Does rewilding have universal support? No. Critics of rewilding fear that the term is being used to justify the removal of humans from the landscape, especially farmers and indigenous communities. In the UK, some have dismissed the concept as a fad for 'toffs' and landowners with vast incomes, while others fear it is being used to attack agricultural communities who have farmed areas for hundreds of years. Can you rewild? While the boldest rewilding initiatives take place at a landscape scale, small changes can have a big impact. Millions of people changing how they mow their grass or let nature into their gardens, balconies and window sills can add up, providing more space for biodiversity to recover. Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.This was the birthplace of radical thinking about rewilding, which has had a huge influence in the UK (where it was one of the inspirations for the Knepp estate in West Sussex) and elsewhere in Europe. However, mainly as a result of these deaths and the outrage that followed, it has been blacklisted by some ecologists, who believe its “ecologically and ethically untenable” management has tarnished rewilding’s reputation.Kuypers says the story was never meant to be about grazing animals, explaining that it was originally a bird reserve, which continues to provide refuge for dozens of rare and declining species. Back in the 1970s, thousands of greylag geese flew over this reclaimed land and set up home. They turned the wetlands into an interesting mosaic of habitats. Other birds arrived too, including spoonbills, egrets and white-tailed eagles, which then spread elsewhere in the Netherlands. At the time, the land had been set aside for industrial development and was in the process of drying out, but an ambitious and influential group of ecologists led by Frans Vera were fascinated by what they were seeing and put forward another plan: to leave it for nature.‘The idea was that nature could take care of itself on this land, but that’s not true. It was not good for biodiversity,’ says Hans-Erik Kuypers. Photograph: Judith Jockel/The GuardianVera said seeing greylag geese engineer new habitats caused a “paradigm shift” in his thinking. “Nature conservationists didn’t have any interest in Oostvaardersplassen when I got involved in 1979 because they always believed it would develop into a thick forest and we would lose all the bird species we love so much,” he says. He then turned to larger mammals. “We found out that large grazers drive habitat creation and that’s now a cornerstone of rewilding.” By 1983 they had created a nature reserve with animals brought in to kickstart the natural processes.“Every square inch of land in the Netherlands is disputed,” says Kuypers, so ringfencing this land for rewilding – a totally new way of working with nature – was revolutionary at the time.Although the birds arrived by themselves, many other animals were brought in and the reserve became like a Big Brother house for nature. Different natural elements were introduced, down to the seeds for reedbeds, which were scattered from a plane. Ecologists wanted to slow the growth of trees in the park so it would remain an open habitat for wetland and grassland birds so they introduced grazing animals.“Back-bred” animals resembling their extinct relations that would have lived in Europe during the Pleistocene, or ice age, arrived: Konik horses from Polandin 1983; Heck cattle from Germany in 1984; and red deer from Scotland in 1992. They were hardy and fitted in with the carefully cultivated wild aesthetic. This work drove radical changes, pushing traditional conservation towards “nature development” with large herbivores as the “ecological main structure”, which is now common thinking in rewilding.In 2018, after an outcry over the deaths of so many animals, a committee coordinated by the provincial government called for an end to the policy of allowing “natural processes” to govern herbivore populations, and said numbers must be kept below 1,500. Today a vet comes regularly to check on the animals. Those in bad condition are fed over the winter. When numbers increase too much, they are moved to new areas or killed, and deer and horse carcasses can be sold as “wild meat”.An emaciated horse at Oostvaardersplassen in 2018, before the project’s shift in approach. Photograph: Utrecht Robin/Action Press/Rex ShutterstockMany lessons have been learned but the rangers working here are still trying to shake off the public image of animals starving to death. “A lot has changed. No animal has died of starvation in three years, yet we’re still seeing these images circulating,” says Kuypers, who has a weekly blog to update people on what is happening at Oostvaardersplassen. “I can’t do anything about it – it’s just one-way communication,” he says about people who troll their work on Twitter. “It really gets under my skin.”Another impact of having too many herbivores in the landscape is that bird numbers fell. Birds that like tall grasses and scrub such as little grebes, spoonbills and egrets suffered because they had less space to forage. “The idea was that nature could take care of itself on this land, but that’s not true,” says Kuypers. “It was not good for biodiversity.”We’re still governed by natural processes as much as possible, but we have enormous impacts as human beingsHans-Erik Kuypers, park rangerRangers now intervene in a number of ways. Within the park, land is divided into blocks, each with very different habitats, including mudflats, reeds, wet grassland, dry grassland and woodland. The terrain is shaped by dykes, pumps and water channels, allowing five different water levels on the site. Wetter sections of the reserve are metres higher than drier sections because, like a sponge, they have expanded as they absorbed water.The park rangers intentionally create dry times and wet times by modifying how much water gets into each section, because “change is good for nature”, helping create a dynamic landscape.They are currently carrying out a “marshland reset”, which means lowering the water level over a period of three years to encourage new reed growth, which will benefit marshland birds. In the grassland area they are creating wet areas and pools, which will benefit geese, herons and waders. Spoonbills, egrets and little grebes like eating small fish such as sticklebacks, and fish ladders are being constructed to make sure these can reach the reserve. Areas are being fenced off for planting trees. More than a kilometre of ditches has been built to give animals shelter and privacy from humans.Land is divided into blocks, each with very different habitats, including mudflats, reeds, wet grassland, dry grassland and woodland. Photograph: Judith Jockel/The Guardian“The goals of the area are human goals to biologically make this a richer place. It’s a huge human experiment and continues to be so,” says Kuypers. “We make nature here … We’re still governed by natural processes as much as possible, but we have enormous impacts as human beings.”Kuypers does not refer to “rewilding” because he thinks it does not accurately reflect how much humans control the landscape. Instead, he calls it “nature development” – which sounds more interesting in Dutch than in English, he says.Rewilders have made a real effort to dispel accusations of depopulating landscapes, which is another reason many have distanced themselves from Oostvardesplassen. The vast marshland of the reserve is totally closed off, and the grassland section is only open for a few visitors a day.“Everything flies away when we come. If you do that 10 times a day, it costs them too much energy. I’m driving around as a guest in nature. Every time a bird flies away I hate it,” says Kuypers.Water mint and marsh endive flourish in a wetland area. Photograph: Judith Jockel/GuardianDespite this, the wooded parts of the reserve are always open and very popular. Cycle routes, footpaths, viewpoints and the visitors centre, which receives up to 150,000 people a year, are being improved.For Vera, Oostvaardersplassen was part of a vision to link it with the Veluwe national park to the south-east. His plan included creating corridors so animals could move between reserves, but this long-term plan has been abandoned.Rewinding 100 years: the Devon neighbours who united to rewild on a grand scaleRead moreVera feels that the public outrage over the deaths of the animals was overblown. He is fundamentally against capping herbivore numbers and says what is happening in Oostvaardersplassen has nothing to do with rewilding because the park is no longer governed by natural processes.“What is happening now in Oostvaardersplassen is killing the integrity of the ecosystem. The people who do that are like stamp collectors creating things artificially to get as many bird species as possible,” he says.Oostvaardersplassen’s 7,500 hectares is roughly the size of Manhattan. Photograph: Judith Jockel/The GuardianDr Paul Jepson, head of innovation at the rewilding consultancy Ecosulis, says rewilding should be about shaping better futures, not creating an agreed natural state. “In talks, I use a music analogy. One, conservation had, like prog rock, become overblown and self-congratulatory. Two, the Oostvaardersplassen, like punk rock, burst on to the scene creating controversy and excitement and shaking things up, leading to, three, a proliferation of new bands (projects): the new wave.”The vast marshland of the reserve is home to many birds. Photograph: Judith Jockel/The GuardianRiver rewilding projects such as Gelderse Poort and Border Meuse, which started in the years after Oostvaardersplassen, have approached things differently and do not have the same notoriety.Despite addressing many criticisms, Oostvaardersplassen is still dogged by the past, with many rewilders looking to distance themselves from it a bit like an old relative with outdated views. It changed the face of nature conservation, however, and was a pioneering example of the benefits of embracing uncertainty and letting nature take its course.It was a rewilding milestone, and remains an extraordinary legacy of human ingenuity and determination. “We’ve been fighting for this area since the beginning,” says Kuypers. “And we still are.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",2022-06-22
 The threat of inflation is not so imminent as No 11 would have us believe,"While higher interest rates would add to the cost of financing the debt burden, central banks are unlikely to raise them soon",,"There was a warning after last week’s budget that Rishi Sunak’s recovery plans could be blown off course by a rise in inflation of such strength that it would force central banks to raise interest rates. A modest increase of just 1% in the interest paid on government debt would add between £20bn and £25bn to the cost of financing the UK’s debt and sink any hopes Sunak had of balancing day-to-day income and spending by 2026.Sunak said as much in his budget speech, using the prospect of higher interest bills as a reason to ramp up taxes on households and businesses in the second half of the parliament.The government’s economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, repeated the warning, giving it an almost ecclesiastical imprimatur. The Institute for Fiscal Studies devoted much of its budget analysis to the subject.When such prominent bodies spice their verdict on the budget with almost hysterical warnings of lava-like costs waiting to roll down from the financial volcano, it is reasonable to ask three questions. Is inflation likely to rise? Would central banks react by raising interest rates? And why, after all the lessons learned during the 2008 financial crash, has the UK left itself so vulnerable to an increase in rates?The answer to the last question is the Bank of England’s purchase of government debt through its quantitative easing programme. With more than a third of government debt on its books, the central bank has become a major mortgage lender to the UK government, and that debt is no longer on fixed-rate terms for 10 or 20 years, but refinanced overnight on the international money markets.Many in the febrile stock markets have bet that a surge in demand from US consumers will trigger rising pricesAt the moment that means a better deal for the government, reducing a 2% charge in the debt markets down to the Bank’s more favourable 0.1% base rate. The flip side of this benefit comes when the Bank, faced with spiralling inflation, increases the base rate and sends the UK’s debt servicing costs higher.At the moment, there are mixed messages from the global economy about the prospects for inflation. The vaccine programme is going well in the US and there is strong pressure on individual states to relax restrictions to the extent that even demands for people to wear masks in shops and indoor amenities will be dropped.Many experts in the febrile world of stock market investing have bet that a surge in demand from US consumers will trigger rising prices. Last week’s economic forecast in Beijing from premier Li Keqiang, when he said that China’s growth this year would be 6%, swelled the number of inflation hawks.Shipping traffic is increasing as trade picks up, and commodity prices have raced ahead. Copper is at a nine-year high while oil prices have rebounded to their pre-pandemic levels. In the first lockdown, a barrel of Brent crude slipped from more than $60 to below $20. By last week it had jumped back to $68.All the signs are that inflation will rise. Yet there will probably be no more than a temporary mismatch between supply and demand. It happened in 2011, when UK inflation spiked above 5% before rapidly falling back to below 2%.And for this reason central banks will look for more fundamental, long-term pressures on inflation. Mostly that means waiting for high levels of employment coupled with wage rises persistently above 4%. Is that possible when Brexit is still putting a drag on exports and pandemic costs are likely to persist for several years?In his latest speech, Jerome Powell, chair of the US Federal Reserve, said it would take a prolonged recovery before interest rates went up. The European Central Bank is of the same mind. There is no reason why the Bank of England should take a different view.Tidal could leave Dorsey holding a dud parcel when the music stopsThe streaming boom has delivered another hit as Jay-Z and his coterie of superstar partners sealed a $297m (£214m) deal to sell a majority stake in their music service, Tidal. The sale is undoubtedly a coup for the rapper and his fellow artist-owners, including Beyoncé, Madonna and Rihanna, who acquired Tidal for $56m in 2015. However, it is less clear whether its new owner – Square, the mobile payments company run by Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s co-founder – has struck a chart-topping deal.Tidal, which originally distinguished itself from other services by offering premium-priced hi-fi video and audio quality, suffered pre-tax losses that broadened significantly from $37.6m to $56.3m between 2018 and 2019, according to the most recent financial filing.The company has had a rocky ride in its short life, including a dispute with artist-owner Kanye West, who broke ranks and terminated his exclusivity deal with Tidal in 2017, and it remains embroiled in an investigation by Norwegian authorities over allegations that it inflated the number of streams for albums including Beyoncé’s Lemonade and West’s The Life of Pablo. Tidal has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.The company is going in the right direction, with revenues growing 13% to $166.9m in 2019, and it said it had enjoyed “steady demand” during the pandemic. However, it remains a minnow, with the last publicly reported numbers putting subscribers at 3 million in 2018, while the music research firm Midia estimates it had about a million as of the start of the pandemic. Spotify has 155 million paying subscribers, with 345 million overall globally, and along with Amazon Music has targeted Tidal’s unique selling point by launching hi-fi subscription tiers. Throw in Apple Music and there is a formidable global top three to fight.Four years ago, Tidal found a cash lifeline in the mobile company Sprint (now T-Mobile), which took a 33% stake for $200m, which Jay-Z recently bought back and sold as part of the Square deal. Now it’s Jack Dorsey’s turn to see if he can keep the music playing.A budget more notable for omissions than action on emissionsLess than a month after the Treasury published a landmark study of the need for economic policy to keep the green agenda at its core, the chancellor delivered a budget which failed to do exactly that.The 600-page review, conducted by Prof Sir Partha Dasgupta, a Cambridge University economist, was commissioned by the Treasury to assess the economic importance of nature. It was published last month amid a growing chorus of voices calling on governments to galvanise green policies to reignite the world’s struggling economies following Covid. But any sign that the chancellor hoped to spur a green economic recovery in the UK was missing in last week’s budget.Sunak’s course back to economic growth takes in protecting jobs, levelling up the regions, and attracting fresh investment into Britain. The green issue is not in the chancellor’s three-plank plan, but he apparently fails to recognise that putting climate policies at the heart of the UK’s economic recovery would achieve all three, while laying the foundations of a more sustainable economy.Instead, policies designed to bolster the country’s green economy were siloed within a two-minute portion of Sunak’s half-hour budget speech. It included green gilts for investors, green saving bonds for the public, and a greener remit for the Bank of England.But there were notable omissions: no mention of a scheme to tackle the UK’s draughty housing stock after the collapse of the Green Homes Grant; no plan to roll out fast electric vehicle charging across the country; and no fresh ideas to directly tackle emissions from aviation and shipping.These policies would all help the UK reach its goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050, but crucially they would spur investment and create green-collar jobs across the regions, starting today. The Treasury plans to respond to Dasgupta’s review in due course, but on the basis of its post-Covid budget, it is clear the message has yet to hit home.",2021-03-07
 Why our secret weapon against the climate crisis could be humourAdam McKay and Dr Ayana Elizabeth Johnson,"We can’t just sit back and watch what’s happening to the planet. We are not an audience. Like it or not, we are in this story",,"As a scientist and a movie maker, we both once naively assumed that data and storytelling would converge to help prevent the imminent collapse of our habitable climate. Fire tornadoes, mega hurricanes, biblical floods, fossil fuel companies misleading the public and gambling our lives for huge profits – of course, such apocalyptic imagery would lead to gripping newscasts, dramatic interpretations, and stirring speeches from our leaders, sparking action at every level of society.After all, the real-life story of the climate crisis makes even the wildest, biggest-budget film like Don’t Look Up seem like a charming EM Forster adaptation. But does this story-of-all-stories get wall-to-wall news coverage? Nope. Not by a long shot.Despite a horrifying parade of extreme weather events fit for an apocalypse film, only 0.4% of corporate news airtime in 2020 was about climate. According to a recent study by MediaMatters, corporate news coverage of the climate catastrophe plummeted by 53% in 2020 compared to 2019. Even before the pandemic, across the entirety of 2019, major networks devoted less than four hours of coverage total to the greatest threat to life on Earth in 65 million years, since the asteroid that took out the dinosaurs.I’m a climate scientist. Don’t Look Up captures the madness I see every day | Peter KalmusRead moreClearly we need to reassess how we’re communicating this massive story. So, Don’t Look Up tries to do something that perhaps doesn’t feel natural with a story as dark as climate change: make the audience laugh. Because when people laugh together it gives them perspective, relief and, most of all, a semblance of community. This is not conjecture. Research shows that humor can lower our defenses and make hard truths easier to hear.Hopefully comedy can help elucidate how our culture of swipes, clicks and likes is taking us further and further away from the one subject we must talk about.Corporations, advertising and PR firms are turning even the most basic exchange of information into a sales pitch or “brand enhancement” and it’s put us in a very dangerous place. What better way to rob this constant churning wall of spin, coercion and success porn than by simply laughing at it? FDR once said: “There’s no better way to disarm the Devil than by pointing out his fly is down.” (He didn’t really say that, but how cool would it be if he had?)The point of all of this is to welcome more and more people into the work of driving forward climate solutionsThis is not to say that everything should be jokes and memes. Some people need a book like The Uninhabitable Earth to give them a kick in the pants – in fact, that’s one of the things that inspired Adam to write this screenplay, along with the 2018 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. Others need a climate solutions podcast like How to Save a Planet, which Ayana co-created, to show a path forward. We need all manner of compelling creations to reach all types of folks.The point of all of this is to welcome more and more people into the work of driving forward climate solutions. Seventy per cent of adults in the US say they are willing to take action on climate, but 51% say they don’t know where to start. Though fervent climate science deniers get lots of attention, they are only 7% of Americans. Amid all the dire news, these are encouraging numbers.Maybe some film or gif or TikTok has jostled you to think seriously about what you can do. Specifically you. Well, here’s one way to answer that question: think of a Venn diagram with three overlapping circles. In the first, put what you’re good at. (So, which Avenger are you and what are your specific super powers?) In the second, put what part of the climate challenge you want to work on. (Your mission, should you choose to accept it.) In the third, put what brings you joy. (What, for you, isn’t work because you love it so much?) And then find your way to the epicenter of that climate action Venn diagram for as many minutes of your life as you can. We don’t all have to do the same thing – in fact we shouldn’t. And if you want some help getting started, we’ve got you covered with some specific suggestions for steps you can take toward a safer planet.You see, when it comes to climate change, we are all in the writers’ room right now, deciding how the story unfolds and how it ends. And that story can be funny, dire, hopeful or all of the above. But not every story is guaranteed a happy ending, even though that’s mostly what we see in movies. So we can’t just sit back and watch. We are not an audience. Like it or not, we are in this story.

‘The crocodiles bellowed at the sky – then mated like mad’: the sex frenzy sparked by helicopters,"There are 3,000 reptiles at the Koorana Crocodile Farm in Queensland, Australia. And all it takes to get them in the mood is some low-flying Chinooks",,"Name: Crocodile mating.Age: As old as crocodiles, presumably.Appearance: As ABC news puts it, “The deed itself is not a particularly romantic procedure.”Season: Mating times for crocodiles vary across the globe, but male arousal can often be triggered by a signal that the females’ optimal egg-laying time is approaching.What sort of signal? Helicopters.What do you mean, helicopters? Chinooks, specifically.The long ones with the rotors at either end? Exactly – they’re like Viagra for crocodiles.Why would that be? No one is certain, but the passing of low-flying Chinooks overhead routinely drives the 3,000 residents of Koorana Crocodile Farm in Queensland, Australia, into an all-out sexual frenzy. “The crocodiles start vocalising to each other,” said the farm’s owner, John Lever.Then what happens? “All of the big males got up and roared and bellowed at the sky,” said Lever. “And then after the helicopters left they mated like mad.”How long has this been going on? At least since the Singapore armed forces began holding joint military exercises in the area.So what is it about helicopters that crocodiles find so arousing? It could be that the males are reacting to what they think is thunder, heralding the wet season, which is ideal for mating.I suppose that’s plausible. Or it could be that the helicopter noise resembles the low-frequency territorial call of bull crocs, prompting all the males to get down to business asap.That also makes a certain amount of sense. It’s even possible that the choppers create a temporary drop in barometric pressure that fools the crocs into thinking a storm is coming.However it works, it sounds like it really works. Indeed.Do we know of any other animals that get excited by patrolling aircraft? No, but human-made noise can affect animal mating in many ways.Give me an example of a sound that spoils the mood. Studies have shown that traffic noise interferes with a female Mediterranean field cricket’s ability to distinguish a superior male courtship song from a less good one.I guess we’ve all made bad choices on that front. Scientists have also investigated whether the sound of new year’s fireworks disrupts the breeding habits of sea lions in Chile.Have they tried helicopters on them? Because I’ve heard that can help. More study is certainly needed.Do say: “I’m like a crocodile, baby – I get turned on by a big chopper.”Don’t say: “Thank you, but can this not wait until we’ve landed safely?”",2023-11-09

","['Anne Davies', '@annefdavies']","The pesticide testing Australia relies on to pick up chemicals in fresh fruit and vegetables sold domestically routinely picked up far fewer breaches than a government study in 2013.Unpublished results of a 2013 pilot study for a national produce monitoring system (NPMS) by the federal agriculture department have been revealed under freedom of information laws.The study was shelved by the former Coalition government despite some disturbing findings.Coalition scrapped pesticide monitoring program that found residues 90 times the limit on strawberriesRead moreTesting of strawberries revealed samples with up to 90 times the maximum residue limit (MRL) set for dimethoate, while one apricot and nine peach samples contained levels of the now-withdrawn pesticide fenthion that were “unacceptable from an acute or short term dietary risk perspective”.The study also looked at the adequacy of the self-regulatory system run by the fruit and vegetable wholesalers, known as FreshTest.The federal government runs a national residue survey that checks pesticides in exported meat and some fruits, but surveillance of food sold in Australia is left to the industry.Under FreshTest growers are tested once a year as part of their food certification. They know when they will be tested and provide the sample to FreshTest.

In contrast, the department’s 2013 pilot on strawberries, peaches and apricots involved randomly buying growers’ produce at the wholesale markets in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and Adelaide, without notice.The department found many more violations of the MRL than FreshTest over the same period.The department also detected agricultural chemicals that were not found at all by FreshTest.In the peach and apricot survey, FreshTest found one sample over the MRL for dimethoate out of eight detections of that chemical. The departmental survey found four samples over the MRL out of five detections.In the case of fenthion, which has now been withdrawn from use in Australia, FreshTest detected 32 instances and no violations. The department found 66 detections and 12 violations.The FreshTest survey did not detect any samples with thiabendazole. The department survey found three, all over the limit.The documents note that the discrepancies are not surprising, given the different sampling methods. FreshTest gives growers notice of when they will be tested, allowing them to potentially reduce their pesticide use and adhere to withholding periods.In relation to apricots the department wrote: “There were clearly big differences, the most striking being dithiocarbamates being detected at a high rate in the NPMS survey, but not at all in the Farm-Fresh survey. This difference is highly significant. The other differences are much weaker.”Gail Woods, the general manager of Fresh Markets Australia, which runs FreshTest, said the information in the NPMS related to processes that were in place over a decade ago.“FreshTest® is an independent fee based, commercial service offered by Fresh Markets Australia (FMA) to provide chemical residue and microbial testing for industry,” she said.“FreshTest® only uses NATA (National Authorities Testing Australia) accredited laboratories of which there are a number across Australia offering residue testing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The results of FreshTest testing are not publicly available.“As industry requirements, products being used by growers and the regulatory environment have evolved over the past 22 years, so has FreshTest®. For instance, we are now able to test for over 460 [agricultural] chemicals in one test compared with under 100 in 2001,” Woods said.“The completion of residue testing of produce is a verification of the ongoing management of chemicals and treatment programs by a business.”State and territory governments have responsibility for monitoring pesticide use and misuse.Food Standards Australia New Zealand, which is responsible for setting standards, said the most recent Australian total diet survey, released in 2019, found concentrations of agvet chemicals were generally low, with a large proportion of food samples containing no detectable residues. It was based on samples collected in 2013 and 2014.How big pesticide reaches into every element of rural life in AustraliaRead moreThe spokesperson said: “The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority and FSANZ take action to review chemical permissions and MRLs where relevant data supports the need to do so.“For example, the approved uses for fenthion have been removed and no MRLs for residues in food remain in the Code,” they said.The agriculture department said the final report of an independent review of the pesticides regulatory system had recommended the establishment of a national domestic produce monitoring program.The department has also recently asked a consultant to identify the sources of data available on pesticide use, residues in food and environmental exposures.“The government is currently considering the final report and its recommendations,” a spokesperson said.",2023-01-12
 Eighteen elephants found dead in Indian forest reserve,Lightning or poisoning cited as possible causes of deaths in protected area in Assam state ,['Agencies'],"Authorities are trying to establish how 18 wild Asiatic elephants died in a remote corner of India’s north-east.The elephants, including five calves, were found dead in the protected Kondali forest reserve in the state of Assam, Jayanta Goswami, a wildlife official, told Associated Press. The forest guard reached the area on Thursday and found 14 elephants dead atop a hill and four at its bottom.Forest officials and a local lawmaker, Jitu Goswami, told Agence France-Presse they believed the elephants died after lightning struck the forest. But Soumyadeep Datta, a prominent conservationist with the environmental activist group Nature’s Beckon, said that was unlikely, based on images shared on social media.“Poisoning could be behind the death of the elephants,” Datta said. “We have to wait for the autopsy report, which the forest department will do soon.”A team of vets and officials headed to the site on Friday together with Assam’s forests and environment minister, Parimal Shuklabaidya. The reserve is in Nagaon district, 95 miles east of Gauhati, the state capital.India is home to nearly 30,000 elephants, about 60% of the wild Asian elephant population. An estimated 6,000 or more wild Asiatic elephants live in Assam. They often come out of the forests in search of food.Conservationists have urged the government to prevent people’s encroachment into elephant territory and to establish free corridors for the elephants to move between forests safely. In recent years wild elephants have entered villages, destroyed crops and even killed people.",2019-12-07
 Joe Biden’s 50% emissions goal is ambitious. But it’s still not enoughWilliam J Ripple,Addressing the climate crisis will be the greatest undertaking in the history of humankind. We have to give it all we have,,"Joe Biden wants to cut US emissions in half from their 2005 levels. However, since emissions have been slowly declining since then, this amounts to only a 37% drop from 2020 levels.That, in a nutshell, is the issue. Our leaders are adhering to a template that doesn’t meet the urgency of the moment. The US is not even the world’s largest emitter any more, and China – the biggest polluter – seeks to build more coal-fired power plants, failing to reach carbon neutrality until 2060. Unfortunately, that is a perfect illustration of just how disconnected we are from the gravity of the situation.In his first 100 days, how has Biden handled the four crises he outlined?Read moreWe’re in a climate emergency, but we still have time to limit the pain. The policy choices, corporate actions and overall responses from the global community over the next 10 years will dictate whether we sink or swim as carbon emissions spark rising sea levels and extreme weather events. But, so long as we continue to use the Paris agreement as the benchmark for success, we will fail to make enough progress in time.Paris was supposed to be a starting point, not the end goal. It was an unprecedented effort to bring the world’s countries together, acknowledge a glaring and neglected problem, and set preliminary goals for substantive action. But it lacked teeth and ambition. The accords call for limiting warming to 1.5–2.0C, but significant climate disasters are already occurring at ~1C warming.Over the past five years, most countries have failed to make headway on reaching their individual commitments to the agreement. The US retreated from the issue, China ramped up its pollution, and only Morocco and the Gambia have been identified as being on track to limit warming to 1.5C. In the meantime, we’ve borne witness to the five hottest years on record, unprecedented storms, sweeping wildfires, uncurbed deforestation, and approximately 167bn tons of carbon being pumped into our atmosphere.Given all this, unsurprisingly, there is a mounting body of evidence that proves 2050 to be an inadequate target for reaching net zero emissions. In addition, we do not fully understand climatic feedback loops and potential tipping points that could be disastrous. The climate crisis is accelerating much faster than most scientists anticipated, and if we don’t immediately enact wholesale and socially just changes throughout our policies, economies, food consumption habits, and relationship to nature, we will fail.There is a lack of appreciation around the sacrifices we have to make to survive. Spending money on infrastructure, and betting on future technologies to save us, is not enough. We must reduce overconsumption by the wealthy who have been the primary beneficiaries of fossil fuel consumption. The US government urgently needs to declare a climate emergency and immediately start phasing in a national carbon fee to make the polluters pay. This list goes on.Biden’s messaging around climate feels aspirational – highlighting the job opportunities and promise behind realigning our society – and he’s not wrong. There are plenty of opportunities on the horizon for those bold and quick enough to seize them. But fixing our economy and providing incentives for green energy is just one piece of the puzzle.What about agriculture? What about over-consumption and the explosion in population growth? What about the mass gutting of our natural resources? Saving the world from a climate catastrophe isn’t going to be quick or fun. It’s going to require grit and tenacity, ingenuity and commitment.Holistic, comprehensive measures are the only way we get out of this. That’s the way you solve any complicated and massive systemic issue.Finding the solution to this problem is the focus of the World Scientists’ Warning of a Climate Emergency report I co-authored last year. Here, we have more than 14,000 scientists from 156 nations endorsing the six steps needed to survive the climate crisis. Those steps revolve around energy (pricing carbon and swiftly phasing out fossil fuels), cutting short-lived pollutants (methane, black carbon, hydrofluorocarbons, etc), restoring and protecting natural ecosystems (forests, mangroves, wetlands, etc), shifting the world’s diet to more plant-based foods (consuming fewer animal products), transitioning to a carbon-free economy using ecological economics, and reducing the unsustainable growth in population (~200,000 a day) that will likely bring the world’s total to more than 8 billion by 2023.This will not be easy. It will be the greatest undertaking in the history of humankind. And that’s what it’s going to take to survive and continue to thrive.

 This article is more than 8 months oldRock concert: Yellowstone seismic activity to be performed on live fluteThis article is more than 8 months old,Real-time data will be displayed for Dr Alyssa Schwartz to play at Atlanta conference,"['Nicola Davis', ' Science correspondent']","Move aside Metallica and Led Zeppelin: scientists are planning to make “rock” music by letting seismic activity headline in a live flute performance.On Tuesday, Dr Domenico Vicinanza of the UK’s Anglia Ruskin University will use a computer program he has developed to turn real-time data, recorded by a seismograph at Yellowstone national park in the US, into a musical score.“I am essentially mapping the [amplitude of the] vibrations and the oscillations to [notes],” he said.The score will be put on a screen as it appears and will be played, live on stage, by Dr Alyssa Schwartz, visiting assistant professor of flute and musicology at Fairmont State University, as part of the 2023 Internet2 Community Exchange conference in Atlanta, Georgia.As the amplitude of the vibrations produced by volcanic activity increase, so too will the notes rise up the musical scale. Likewise, if the seismograph data shows dramatic oscillations, so too will the melody.Vicinanza will use a computer program he has developed to turn real-time data, recorded by a seismograph the US Geological Survey at Yellowstone national park, into a musical score. Photograph: US Geological SurveyWith the musical notes determined live, the piece will – by definition – be a premiere.Vicinanza appears confident it will be a memorable event. “I’m pretty sure I am going to get something that is interesting because you always have some sort of [seismic] activity [at Yellowstone],” he said.Yellowstone – a super volcano – experiences between 1,500 and 2,500 earthquakes a year, with the activity detected by a network of 50 seismographs run by the US Geological Survey.“Nearly 50% of the earthquakes occur in swarms that cluster together,” said Vicinanza. “So it’s a fantastic playground for any kind of scientist that is interested in seismology, geophysics, mechanics or, like me, data science and music, because it’s a very unique.”It is not the first time Vicinanza, a composer, physicist and researcher in auditory display, has sought to tune into the unusual – he previously used 37 years’ worth of data collected by Voyager 1 and 2 to create a musical piece producing, as the Guardian described it, “a duet from deep space”.Extract of the last 15 minutes of seismic activity recorded by the US Geological Survey at Yellowstone National Park. Photograph: Dr Domenico Vicinanza/Anglia Ruskin UniversityVicianza said he was drawn to the idea of turning earthquakes into music as a way to provide a different perspective on something that seems familiar: the trace of a seismograph formed by a needle on paper.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But he stressed the human performer remained crucial, with Schwartz bringing her own interpretation of the score to the piece and using the notes to tell a story.“She will be able to highlight what she will think at that moment is the most relevant thing,” he said.Vicianza said he hoped the performance might also give listeners good vibrations about science.“[Science] is something that everybody can enjoy,” he said.",2023-05-08
Country diary: The old Twin Peaks are now a land of opportunity,"Willington, County Durham: Kestrels and fieldfares thrive on this grassy hillside that is steeped in history","['Phil Gates', '@WeardaleDiary']","The growl of high-street traffic had barely faded as we walked uphill, away from the town centre, when we saw the kestrel. She was sitting on a leafless branch of a cherry tree, feathers fluffed, her back turned towards the icy wind. She seemed reluctant to fly as we drew closer. Cautiously sidling around her, we could see that her pale eyelids were closed; dozing in the early morning sunshine, perhaps digesting her last meal.Then her head swivelled and our eyes met; mirrors of polished jet glared down at us. A shimmy of plumage, to smooth ruffled feathers, and she was away, chestnut wings scything across the grassy hillside.The gaze of a kestrel: ‘mirrors of polished jet glared down at us’. Photograph: Phil GatesWillington grew around a coalmine that closed in 1967. For 120 years, a jagged mountain of colliery waste, known locally as Twin Peaks, stood on this spot. Earlier generations called it Dante’s, a reference, some say, to coal spoil tips’ potential to spontaneously combust and become an inferno. Many would have experienced hellish conditions, hewing coal in labyrinthine mine tunnels under it. Miner and poet Richard Watson’s words, “Large rubbish heaps along the hillside show / the vast extent of hollow ground below”, chiselled into a commemorative stone, testify to their toil.In the early 70s, Twin Peaks was reduced to a gently regraded grassy hill, creating an open public space, a pleasant place to spend a morning watching birds or even, in summer, enjoying a picnic, just 10 minutes’ walk from the town centre.Now it’s known as Willington Woods. Oaks and hawthorns were planted by community groups and schoolchildren in 2005, more trees added later by a local hospice. This morning a noisy flock of fieldfares plundered a fine crop of haws. Much of the hillside remains open grassland, clothed in winter with a deep thatch of dead grass, riddled with tunnels of field voles; a land of opportunity for a hunting kestrel.From our kestrel’s-eye view on the hilltop we had a vast, panoramic view of the Wear valley beyond. Below, in the town, sunlight glinted from solar panels on house roofs that would once have been wreathed in coal smoke, rising from chimneys on winter mornings like this.

 Rowan Williams urges wealthy to stump up cash for climate fund,Former archbishop of Canterbury says richest nations and individuals must take lead on ‘loss and damage’,"['Fiona Harvey', ' Environment editor']","Rich countries and wealthy individuals must urgently consider how to come up with the cash needed to help poor countries afflicted by climate disaster, the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams has said.At the Cop27 UN climate summit in Egypt, which finished a week ago after a marathon final session ran more than 50 hours over deadline, the first steps were taken to establish a “loss and damage” fund for vulnerable countries stricken by extreme weather.But while he welcomed the achievement, Williams said the “much harder” work of filling the fund had yet to begin. “I’m not dancing in the streets yet,” he said.“The fact that the fund is now there is certainly an outcome to be grateful for, as it’s a key building block,” he said in an interview. “But it remains aspirational. We don’t know what the US Congress will do with it, for example. We need some strong statements from the major international players.”Williams said the world’s wealthiest people, who are sometimes referred to as the global “polluting elite” because of the very high greenhouse gas emissions resulting from their lavish lifestyles, must bear more of the responsibility for providing finance for vulnerable people affected by the climate crisis, and making changes to their own lives.“It’s quite difficult to get the wealthiest countries and the more conspicuous consumers to recognise the sheer physical urgency we face,” he said. “I think it would really help to bring [those consumers] into focus.”Poorer people in developed countries should not be asked to shoulder more of the burden at a time of high energy prices, he added. “It’s important to bear in mind exactly where the weight will fall on people, at a time of energy crisis,” he said.“Where the burden falls heavily on the poorest, we must make sure we are not simply transferring this urgent burden from one [set of poor people] to another.”Williams said a windfall tax on oil and gas producers could be one way to raise the cash needed for a loss and damage fund. “In principle, it’s a good thought and to be welcomed,” he said.He noted that Cop27 had failed to produce an agreement to phase out fossil fuels, and said he was concerned by the influence of fossil fuel companies at the summit. He called on governments to consider excluding them from future meetings. “It seems to me perfectly clear this is not a place for that kind of lobbying,” he said. “I would certainly be relieved if they were not there. I worry about next year at Cop28 a lot.”Cop28, the next UN climate summit, will be held in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, which brought a delegation of more than 1,000 people, including many high-ranking representatives of fossil fuel companies, to Cop27 in Sharm el-Sheikh.According to research seen by the Guardian, there were more than 630 fossil fuel lobbyists present at Cop27.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

People are urged to “do no harm”, to “look after tomorrow” and to “rise above ego for our world”.Williams said it was important for people to “keep positive” and to remember that “small actions can have big effects” on the planet. “This is not about making people feel bad,” he said.“There are better and worse, healthier and unhealthier ways to relate to the environment,” said Williams. “Think of that and of how to get yourself and those close to you into a better relation to the external environment.”",2022-11-29
 Rewilding the red centre: bilbies released into NT predator-free sanctuary in bid to save threatened species,"The animals are a crucial part of the Australian Wildlife Conservancy’s Newhaven scheme to reintroduce 11 vulnerable native mammals

Get our free news app; get our morning email briefing
",['Australian Associated Press'],"In the red centre of Australia, a ring-fenced refuge for threatened native mammals is slowly but surely expanding its population.Earlier this week, 32 threatened greater bilbies moved in and 65 burrowing bettongs will join them before the weekend is out.The new arrivals are part of an ambitious plan to “rewild” 9,450 hectares of central Australia with species that once thrived there before European settlement and the resultant feral pest invasion.‘No excuses’: limited conservation efforts could save at least 47 Australian animals from extinctionRead moreAs expert earthmovers, the bilbies and bettongs have a crucial role to play in bolstering the health of the Australian Wildlife Conservancy’s predator-free Newhaven Sanctuary near Alice Springs.Greater bilbies can each shift a whopping 20 tonnes of topsoil a year as they burrow about their business and forage for food.Burrowing bettongs do much the same, with the two species often dubbed ecosystem engineers for their ability to reform the landscape.“It’s pretty crazy to think they’re digging that much. It’s great to have them back here because they do so much,” says AWC field ecologist Aliesha Dodson, who released the bilbies on Wednesday night.“They dig up hard ground to form their burrow systems but even just eating, they dig up lots of soil and that helps germination and soil health and their burrows can also be used by other animals for shelter.”It’s hoped that over time the bilbies and bettongs will thrive and create a healthier home for the 11 threatened native mammals the AWC will return to Newhaven.Three have already been reintroduced including the mala, a small wallaby that used to be abundant in the Northern Territory but is now extinct in the wild. Six more species will follow, including the numbat, the western quoll and and the golden bandicoot.

You can much more easily introduce other species because they’ve done all of the gardening for us.”",2022-05-28
Could growing celery in rewetted peatland help fight climate change?,"A trial is farming crops that can tolerate high water levels on bogland, and prevent carbon being released",['Jeremy Plester'],"Could celery help fight climate change? Peatlands in lowland Britain have been drained for agriculture and releasing carbon for years, but paludiculture, or wet farming, aims to rewet drained peatland and grow crops that can tolerate high water levels. In Greater Manchester, the local wildlife trust is growing celery on bogland that was drained for farming, leaving a small relic of old peat below the surface. The drains and ditches of the old field were blocked up, the water table allowed to rise 10cm to 50cm below the surface, preventing the peat releasing its carbon, while celery has been planted – a crop that tolerates wet conditions.In the Fens, cattail bulrushes are being grown in rewetted old peat, then harvested and processed as fireproof insulation for housing, biodegradable food packaging, and as compost for commercial growers. The plants also clean up excess nutrients from the water they grow in and help store water. At the Great Fen in Cambridgeshire, a paludiculture trial is growing sphagnum moss. This is highly absorbent and naturally antiseptic, and was used as bandages in the first world war. The top of the moss can even be turned into a substitute for peat compost for growing seedlings.",2023-02-23
Honk honk! Can noise cameras reduce ‘potentially fatal’ sound pollution?,"As noise detectors are installed in a rich neighborhood of Manhattan, experts worry they will punish people of color",['Alaina Demopoulos'],"Honking cars, blasting stereos, babbling neighbors: consider it all part of the symphony that plays daily on New York City streets. Everyone knows the city is loud, and politicians have waged a long, losing war against noise. Now they have a new weapon: noise cameras.The cameras, which are paired with a sound meter to detect noise of at least 85 decibels from a source 50ft or more away, have recently been installed on certain streets in Manhattan’s wealthy Upper West Side.Property over people? New York City’s $52bn plan to save itself from the seaRead moreIt’s part of a program run by the city’s department of environmental protection, and last year the New York governor, Kathy Hochul, signed the Stop Loud and Excessive Exhaust Pollution (Sleep) Act, which raised fines for cars or motorcycles that have been illegally modified to be noisier. The deafening vrooms from vehicles are the primary targets of these noise cameras, which will lead to fines ranging from $220 for a first offense to $2,625 for a repeated default.It’s not just New York City. Knoxville, Tennessee; Miami; and sections of California are working with the UK-based company SoundVue to add noise detectors on streets. SoundVue is owned by Intelligent Instruments Ltd, and Reuben Peckham, a director, said the baseline infraction of 85 decibels that the cameras register is “similar to the noise level from a lawn mower at the operator’s position”.A ‘noise’ camera, equipped with microphones to detect unusually loud vehicles in Berlin. Photograph: John MacDougall/AFP/Getty ImagesPeckham would not reveal how much these cameras cost. He said the basic structure uses a microphone and algorithm to detect noise, and then logs the offender’s license plate.“The microphones are spaced a small distance apart, which means the sound hits each microphone with a tiny delay relative to the other,” he explained. This machine uses this delay to pinpoint where the sound comes from.Erica Walker studies the relationship between community noise and health at Brown University, where she is an assistant professor of epidemiology. She believes most noise comes from poor city planning rather than individual bad actors, and that noise cameras are merely Band-Aids for a more systemic issue.“I just think noise cameras are a very lazy and superficial solution,” she said. “A better noise mitigation strategy should be a pro-peace perspective, where everyone has to come to the table and agree to a solution, rather than the city just shutting down the acoustical culture of a community.”Walker used to do research in Boston, where people who lived near Fenway Park would often complain about noise streaming from the baseball stadium.“It’s not like they are going to put noise cameras in the middle of the field, and every time it hit a certain decibel, the Red Sox would be fined,” she said. “What’s more likely to happen is that the cameras are going to be put in a neighborhood with a lot of Black and brown kids who play loud music. So yes, you can punish and fine a lot of people, but it’s not going to address these bigger picture issues.”New York is building the world’s tallest jail in Chinatown. Can anyone stop it?Read moreWhen asked to address the argument that noise cameras could over-police communities of color, Peckham, the manufacturer, said: “Nonsense.” He added: “If no violation is committed, then there is no risk of surveillance.”Noise is more than merely unpleasant; researchers say there are serious risks that come with prolonged exposure to loud sounds.“Most people recognize that too much noise damages your hearing, but we’re getting increasingly concerned as there is a rich body of literature connecting noise with cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, risk of heart attack and strokes,” said Richard Neitzel, an environmental health studies professor at the University of Michigan. “It’s harming us in ways that are potentially fatal, and much more common than we historically understood.”While experts typically study noise in the city, Neitzel says people who live in rural areas also suffer from its effects. The Apple Hearing Study at the University of Michigan studied noise across 130,000 people in the US, and found that in some cases, smaller towns could be just as loud as urban areas.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In rural areas, it’s the workplace, agriculture or manufacturing plants.”But perhaps no place has tried to turn down the cacophony quite like New York City.In 1906, the Upper West Side physician Julia Barnett Rice began the Society for the Suppression of Unnecessary Noise, which counted Mark Twain and Thomas Edison among its members. Out of Rice’s activism came a flurry of reforms, such as legislation prohibiting steamboat captains from sounding their whistles without reason, city-mandated quiet zones and arrests of people setting off Fourth of July fireworks near hospitals.But as the 20th century unfurled, New York only became noisier. In 1935, Fiorello H La Guardia made conquering noise a top priority as mayor, tearing down some elevated subway lines and building playgrounds so children wouldn’t shout as much on the streets. The city passed its first noise bill a year later, restricting acoustic activities such as playing loud music, and the use of loudspeakers. It was updated in 1972 to account for more modern nuisances such as air conditioners, car alarms and horn-honking.‘No stopping New York’? Park performers condemn police crackdown on artists’ rightsRead moreThese laws did not fix New York’s problem, and only added more issues. In the 1990s, the NYPD launched “Operation Soundtrap”, a crackdown on boom boxes that primarily targeted young men of color.According to Audrey Amsellem, a lecturer at Columbia University with expertise on sound and surveillance, in that case, “the regulation of noise had more to do with the identity of the noisemaker than the sound itself.”Breakdancers on the street in New York City in 1981. Photograph: UniversalImagesGroup/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesShe also expressed concern about the surveillance capabilities of noise cameras. “Once these devices are installed, they rarely come down,” she said. “These are AI-driven, meaning capabilities can be added over time. We know that noise cameras are equipped with – at least – sensors and cameras. What other kind of data, apart from traffic noise, can they gather? Does this present a privacy risk for residents of the city? Who does it punish, and who does it protect?”Last year, the writer Xochitl Gonzalez became a finalist for the Pulitzer prize when she wrote about the classist policing of noise. Gonzalez, a Brooklyn native, grew up listening to the sounds of the city, and then attended an Ivy League university where “silence was an aesthetic to be revered”. When she moved back home after college, she noticed her neighborhood was being filled with monied white transplants who lodged noise complaints against her friends and family. To Gonzalez, “the sound of gentrification is silence.”",2023-10-04
"Ronald Blythe at 100: ‘A watchful, curious and gratefully amazed vision of life’ ",A life rooted in Suffolk has given the great nature writer Ronald Blythe a deep love of the countryside,"['Patrick Barkham', '@patrick_barkham']","The greatest living writer on the English countryside will celebrate his 100th birthday this week at his home, Bottengoms Farm, surrounded by the friends he calls his “dear ones”. Ronald Blythe is best known for Akenfield, his moving and intimate portrait of a Suffolk village through the lives of its residents, which became an instant classic when published in 1969. But Blythe, who has spent all his 10 decades living within 50 miles of where he was born, has also devoted millions more words – in history, fiction, and luminous essays and columns – to describe with poetry and precision not simply rural folk but the very essence of existence.His writing is honoured in a new volume, Next to Nature, a highlights package of nearly a quarter-century of weekly columns for the Church Times, written between 1993 and 2017. Fellow writers agree that Blythe’s work has improved with age. His friend Richard Mabey notes in an introduction that these columns resemble Virginia Woolf’s ideal diary, which she felt should be “like some old desk” full of odds and ends, which in retrospect refines itself “into a mould, transparent enough to reflect the light of our life”. For Mabey, Blythe possesses a “watchful, curious, compassionate, unifying and gratefully amazed vision of life”.The eldest of six children of a farm labourer and a nurse, Blythe was born in Suffolk in 1922. Although he read voraciously, he left school at 14. Later he was conscripted to serve in the second world war but friends say he was judged congenitally unsuitable for fighting, and he ended up working as a librarian in Colchester. In the late 1940s he met Christine Kühlenthal, the wife of the painter John Nash, who introduced him to the often bohemian writers and artists drawn to the area, including EM Forster and Benjamin Britten. Eventually Blythe, who has always lived alone, inherited the Nashes’ home on the border of Suffolk and Essex, which remains his home today. “Ronnie has always been elated that he had the life he wanted out of very difficult circumstances,” his friend the art critic and writer Ian Collins says. “He’s had to do it all himself, with the support of Christine Nash who recognised him and got him out of the library.”A life in writing: Ronald BlytheRead moreA life rooted in East Anglia has given Blythe a rare depth of vision. His writing is attuned to the physicality of existence, attentive to the world around him, and always listening to people and other species, as here, in June:
Early morning in the heatwave, the air still and sullen, the trees cardboard shapes, the birds silent. One can almost hear the dead rose-petals falling. David’s corn is a motionless bluey-green sea. At the moment, the day is holding back its potential and seems uncommitted, but in a little while the sun will spin up in the east like a gold coin. Yesterday, the washing dried in an hour.
As the writer Julia Blackburn observes in one of 12 introductions to the monthly sections in Next to Nature, Blythe “is able to move as seamlessly as a ghost between time past, time present and even time future”, often within one elegant sentence encompassing scripture, literature and oral rememberings.An account of night-walking is “a miniature masterpiece”, according to another contributor and friend, Robert Macfarlane. Blythe writes: “It is a night for a discreet wander – one must never forget the scandal caused by the Wordsworths and Coleridge at Nether Stowey by their nocturnal ramblings.” It is filled with vivid observations – “Cats emerge from ditches with golden glances at this late person” – and deep history: “The church tower is a charcoal stump, just as it was during the summer nights which followed the Conquest.”Blythe at home in Suffolk. Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/The GuardianBlythe has long championed the poet John Clare, and there are similarities, as Olivia Laing observes, in Blythe’s “attentive and unsentimental” view of the countryside. When he writes about “gaudy” fields of borage, Blythe knows how it is harvested and where it will be sold. “A very Clare-like knowledge, this, obtained by the steady, perpetual listening that gave Akenfield its power,” Laing writes.As well as being an adept listener, Blythe is also a free thinker and writer, which Collins attributes to his lack of formal education. “People from his class didn’t go to university,” he says. “He taught himself by reading and this has given him great freedom. It’s such a singular voice across forms. He’s not constricted by training. He has no received opinions at all.”For many years, Blythe was a lay reader for his local parish, often performing the de facto job of vicar without a stipend. Collins feels Blythe was slightly taken advantage of by the Church of England, despite the Church Times giving him the weekly column that arguably delivered his best work. Mabey, an atheist, admits he has never discussed with Blythe his “quite unselfconscious, unquestioning, sometimes irreverent, and just occasionally pagan-tinged Christian faith”.But Rowan Williams, who also contributes to Next to Nature, believes that Blythe’s faith has been crucial in liberating him as a writer and as a person. “He’s somebody who is very committed to the Christian tradition and he uses it to think with, he uses it as a structure – a Christian year, the round of festivals and commemorations, for him is woven into the round of the calendar year as it would have been for generations before him,” Williams says. “You can think more freely and you may be able to feel more deeply if you’re confident that there’s this steady backdrop. You don’t have to keep making things up. There’s a world you can inhabit, your feet are on the ground, and that means you can walk around, breathe deeply and look slowly. That’s faith.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Inside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Mr Buffett lives in a nondescript house with a nondescript car, and there is no computer in his nondescript office. He likes Evan, with his sweet, crocodile grin.”Blythe’s writing is not nostalgic for lost country life; it often refers to past hardships. “He knows how hard country life was,” Collins says. “He certainly doesn’t want that back. He said he’d like the countryside to be repopulated again but with the farmworkers coming back as their own masters.”And yet Blythe does represent a way of life that has all but disappeared and Williams detects a gentle moral in his writing. “He’s certainly saying to us, ‘This may be a way of life that’s passing, and it’s not perfect, but you’re going to be much worse off if you’re not ready to learn from it, so let me help you learn from it.’ He’s saying, ‘Society is moving on – don’t forget this.”In his 50s, Blythe wrote The View in Winter, a moving account of growing old which Collins feels is due a revival. “It’s a wonderful book, a very positive view of old age. He lives an incredibly contented life.” Collins helped his mentor “retire” in 2017 and began to manage his affairs after asking him about a pile of unpaid bills and receiving Blythe’s answer: “I’ve decided I’ve given them enough money over the years. I’m not giving them any more!”For all the brilliance of his memory a decade ago, he has now been diagnosed with dementia. “He lives in a kind of dream world and he’s probably still writing books in his head,” Collins says. “He’s so fortunate to have this amazing physical strength. He’s never taken any medication apart from a bit of sherry. He caught Covid on his 98th birthday. A short course of antibiotics just sent him into space.”Blythe recovered, and also survived a recent fall. His dear ones bring him three meals a day and everyone is determined that he will still be in his home, as he wishes, when he dies.Of night-walking, Blythe wrote that everywhere was “all so perfectly interesting that one might never go to bed”. According to Macfarlane, this captures Blythe’s sensibility in a sentence: “inquisitive, wandering, democratic, giving us the truth on the ground”.

‘Decades ahead of his time’: history catches up with visionary Jimmy Carter,"A new film rejects the popular narrative and recasts the former president, 96, as hugely prescient thinker, particularly on climate change",['Megan Mayhew Bergman'],"When I reach Jimmy Carter’s grandson by Zoom, he answers wearing a Raphael Warnock campaign T-shirt. Jason Carter is a lawyer and politician himself, mid-40s, animated and well-read, with blue eyes reminiscent of his grandfather’s. He’s just got off the phone with his 93-year-old grandmother, Rosalynn. It’s a special day; Joe Biden is on his way to the Carter house in Plains, Georgia.“My grandfather has met nearly everyone in the world he might want to,” Jason Carter says. “Right now, he’s meeting with the president of the United States. But the person he’d say he learned the most from was Rachel Clark, an illiterate sharecropper who lived on his family’s farm.“He didn’t pity her,” Carter says. “He saw her power. My grandfather believes in the power of a single human and a small community. Protect people’s freedoms, he says, and they can do great things. It all comes back to an enormous respect for human beings.”Joe Biden on his way to meet Jimmy Carter in Plains, Georgia. Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersCarter is openly moved speaking about his grandfather, though it’s also clear he does so often. A spate of recent biographies and documentaries shows not just a renewed interest in the former president, but a willingness to update the public narrative surrounding his time in office. Recent biographer Jonathan Alter calls Carter “perhaps the most misunderstood president in American history”.Carter, who lost his bid for re-election in a so-called landslide to Reagan in 1980, is often painted as a “failed president” – a hapless peanut farmer who did not understand how to get things done in Washington, and whose administration was marked by inflation, an energy crisis and the Iran hostage disaster.Subsequent presidents, especially fellow southern Democrat Bill Clinton, kept a distance – assumably not wanting to be seen as part of a political narrative that emphasized piety over getting things done. Even Obama was apparently wary of being associated with the sort of soft-hearted ineffectuality ascribed to Carter.But was Carter actually so ineffectual?In his 2020 biography of Carter, Alter speaks to a more nuanced interpretation of Carter, calling him “a surprisingly consequential president – a political and stylistic failure, but a substantive and far-sighted success”. It is, perhaps, the far-sighted nature of Carter’s ambitions, particularly around energy, that allows us to appreciate him more four decades after his term concluded.Born in 1924, Carter is now 96. Americans must process his mortality and the onset of climate change, which Carter explicitly warned the nation about 40 years ago.Carterland, a just released documentary, offers a particularly sharp focus on Carter’s extensive work on conservation, climate and justice.00:01:44Carterland: preview of the documentary on former president Jimmy Carter – video“Here’s what people get wrong about Carter,” Will Pattiz, one of the film’s directors tells me. “He was not in over his head or ineffective, weak or indecisive – he was a visionary leader, decades ahead of his time trying to pull the country toward renewable energy, climate solutions, social justice for women and minorities, equitable treatment for all nations of the world. He faced nearly impossible economic problems – and at the end of the day came so very close to changing the trajectory of this nation.”Will’s brother, Jim, agrees. “A question folks should be asking themselves is: what catastrophes would have befallen this country had anyone other than Jimmy Carter been at the helm during that critical time in the late 1970s?”Those late 1970s were defined by inflation, the cold war, long lines at gas pumps, and a shift in cultural mores. Carter himself showed a willingness to grow. Although Carter served in the navy himself, he pardoned Vietnam draft-dodgers. Though from a segregated and racist background in Georgia, Carter pushed for affirmative action and prioritized diversity among judicial nominees, including the appointment of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Amalya Lyle Kearse. He employed Mary Prince, a Black woman wrongly accused of murder, as his daughter Amy’s nanny, a move criticized by some contemporary thinkers as perpetuating domestic servitude.What was radical in the 1970s can appear backwards decades later; the public narrative works in both directions. Carter is, in some respects, difficult to narrativize because he could be both startlingly conservative – financially, or in his appeal to the deep south’s evangelicals – and progressive, particularly on human rights and climate. He seemed to act from his personal compass, rather than a political one.Carter taking a question during a speech in Yazoo, Mississippi, in July 1977. Photograph: Wally McNamee/Corbis via Getty ImagesHe startled the globe by personally brokering the critical Middle East peace treaty between Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin at Camp David. He ceded access to the Panama canal, angering conservatives who thought he was giving away an American asset. Through the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, he doubled the national park system and conserved over 100m acres of land – the most sweeping expansion of conserved land in American history.He was not afraid to make unpopular moves, or ask for personal sacrifice. He was old-fashioned and a futurist, and nowhere did his futurism matter more, or seem more prescient, than on climate and conservation. He risked speaking directly to the American public, and asking them to do a difficult thing – focus on renewable energy and reduce reliance on oil.He paid the price for this frank ask, and so did we.In advance of his trip to Plains, Georgia, Biden participated in a video tribute to Carter, joining an all-star cast of Georgia politicians, the familiar faces of Senator Jon Ossoff, Senator Raphael Warnock and Stacey Abrams serving as an affirming nod to Georgia’s return to political importance.The messages address the substance of the film, but also serve as a heartfelt thank you to a former president who has only recently begun to look prescient on climate, and singular in his moral bearing.“He has always lived his values,” Abrams says in the video.“Our world cries out for moral and ethical leadership,” Warnock offers. “Few have embodied it as clearly and consistently as Carter.”“He showed us what it means to be a public servant, with an emphasis on servant,” Biden says.00:07:51Joe Biden, Stacey Abrams and others pay tribute to Jimmy Carter ahead of documentary release – videoMany Americans can’t help but spot a link between Carter and Biden – who became the first elected official outside of Georgia to support Carter’s bid for the presidency in 1976. Biden’s colleagues decried him as an “exuberant” idealist at the time.There’s also an increasingly stark comparison between the Carter and the Trump administration.James Gustave Speth served as the chairman of Carter’s Council on Environmental Quality. As Carter’s chief adviser on environmental matters, Speth helped brief Carter on climate change and direct policy. He finds the contrast between Carter and Trump “striking”.“People see now that Carter was at a pole,” Speth tells me. “Carter was the opposite of Trump – and everything that people despised about him. Carter had integrity, honesty, candor and a commitment to the public good of all else. Carter was a different man, totally.”Carter’s vice-president, Walter Mondale, died a month ago at 93, perhaps putting an exclamation mark on the need to expedite overdue praise and understanding. Speth agrees that it would be best to speed up our recognition of Carter. “So many fine things are said over the bodies of the dead,” Speth said. “I’d love to have the recognition occur now.”Speth is also working on his own book on the Carter administration, that covers the Carter and subsequent administrations on climate and energy and highlights the failure to build on the foundation that Carter laid. His project, soon to be published with MIT, carries a damning title: They Knew.One of the most profound– even painful – parts of watching documentaries like Carterland is bearing witness to the fact that Carter was right on asking us to drive less, to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, to focus on conservation and renewable energy. Not only was Carter’s vision a path not taken, it was a path mocked. Reagan removed the solar panels from the White House, politicized the environmental movement and painted it as a fringe endeavor.“Carter was our only president who had a visceral environmental and ecological attachment. That was part of his being,” Speth says. “We had an opportunity in 1980 – but we’ve lost 40 years in the pursuit of a climate-safe path. We can no longer avoid serious and destructive changes, period. That didn’t have to happen.”Carter writes in the guest book at the end of his visit to the Cuban Jewish Community centre in Havana, in March 2011. Photograph: Adalberto Roque/AFP/Getty ImagesI ask Speth why getting Carter’s legacy right matters. First, Speth says, it’s important to recognize the example Carter set for looking ahead, in a culture that prizes soundbites and short-term gains. “Carter was a trained engineer who believed in science,” Speth points out. “He understood things on a global scale, and believed in forecasting. Preparing for the long run is rare in politics.”Carter’s biographer Alter agrees. “If there is a gene for duty, responsibility and the will to tackle messy problems with little or no potential for political gain,” he writes, “Jimmy Carter was born with it.”While none of these recent documentaries or biographies seeks to portray Carter as a saint or even politically savvy, they do insist that his presidency was more successful than history has acknowledged, particularly on the energy, conservation and human rights fronts. Still, there are aspects of his single term that will probably remain embedded in his narrative, such as his tenuous relationship with Congress, early catering to segregationists to win votes, and Iran’s hostage crisis.What can we learn from the shifting narrative around Carter’s presidency?“You can talk about how Carter was an underrated president,” film-maker Jim Pattiz says. “But can you ask yourself: what qualities do you actually want in a leader? Do you want someone who will challenge you to be better, or speak in catchphrases and not ask much of you?“This film is a cautionary tale,” Pattiz says. “We can elect another Carter. Let’s reward leaders willing to do the right thing.”Jason Carter has lived with the nuances and inconsistencies in the narrative surrounding his grandfather’s presidency his entire life. “Stories are always summaries,” he says. “They leave out so much so that we can understand them in simple terms. Public narrative, these days, is so often about politics. It should really be about the great, public problems we’re solving. There’s a difference.“I don’t want history to be kind to my grandfather,” Jason Carter tells me. “I just want history to be honest.”",
Legal eagles: how climate litigation is shaping ambitious cases for nature,Environmental lawsuits are nothing new but now lawyers are turning their attention to cases that address the loss of biodiversity,"['The age of extinction is supported by', 'About this content', 'Isabella Kaminski']","The Tagus estuary near Lisbon is Portugal’s largest wetland, a vital habitat and stopover for tens of thousands of migratory birds, including flamingos, black-tailed godwits and glossy ibis. It has also been earmarked as the site of a new airport, leading the environmental law charity ClientEarth and a group of Portuguese NGOs to sue Portugal’s government. When they get their day in court, they will argue that the authorities failed to properly consider how the project would affect an internationally protected nature reserve, and the knock-on effects on other countries visited by the birds.“If you destroy that site, you have an impact not only in Lisbon, but on all the sites up the flyway,” says Anna Heslop, head of wildlife and habitats at ClientEarth. “If the bird populations don’t arrive, they never get breeding.”Black-tailed godwits are among tens of thousands of migratory birds that visit the Tagus estuary in Portugal. Photograph: Jaime Sousa/SPEAWhile environmental lawsuits are not a new phenomenon – the earliest known case, a dispute over water resources, dates back 4,500 years – campaigners are thinking more deeply about how they can tackle the complex problem of modern biodiversity loss.Heslop says litigants are increasingly looking beyond a single site or narrow issue. “Those older school cases will continue. What we aim to do is to have a bigger impact across the whole, like every site in Europe or south-east Asia, or to push governments to be more ambitious. The trick for us is finding cases that will have a more strategic impact; I don’t think that was happening on the same scale before.”The importance of litigation is not to turn one ship around but set a precedent so others don’t wait for it to happen to themZaneta Sedilekova, Clyde & CoThe lack of a strategic approach to date is partly a reflection of a wider misunderstanding of the scale of the global biodiversity crisis, says Heslop. “Climate change advocates have done a great job over the last 10, 20 years, of making people realise this is a massive issue and therefore they get more of the resources,” says Heslop. “But they’re twin and equal crises and if you fix climate change and not biodiversity, we’re all screwed.”Guillaume Futhazar, a senior research fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law, is part of a team that has been studying biodiversity litigation around the world and is publishing a book on their findings. They knew it was an important issue, but it was not getting the same attention as the growing wave of lawsuits on the climate crisis.Q&AHow are the climate and biodiversity crises linked?ShowOur biosphere – the thin film of life on the surface of our planet – is being destabilised by temperature change. Extreme weather events are becoming more common, with flooding, sea level rises, droughts and storms all affecting biodiversity and its ability to support us. In the ocean, heatwaves and acidification are stressing organisms and ecosystems already under pressure from human activities such as overfishing and habitat fragmentation.The landmark Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report showed that extreme heatwaves that would usually happen every 50 years are already happening every decade. If warming is kept to 1.5C these will happen approximately every five years.The effect of the climate crisis on the Earth’s biodiversity is already being seen. The distributions of 47% of land-based flightless mammals and almost a quarter of threatened birds may already have been negatively affected by the climate crisis, the IPBES (Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services) warns. Five per cent of species are at risk of extinction from 2C warming, climbing to 16% with a 4.3C rise.Scientists increasingly argue the climate and biodiversity crises are linked. The destruction of the planet’s carbon-rich habitats, such as peatlands, forests, wetlands and grasslands, is damaging biodiversity and releasing vast amounts of greenhouse gases.If 15% of the world’s most degraded land was restored, and the remaining habitats which are still in good condition protected, it could store a third of all greenhouse gas emissions created by humans since the Industrial Revolution, according to researchers.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Futhazar notes that laws governing different facets of biodiversity, such as endangered species, clean water or land use, are well established in many countries. But he says a better understanding of ecosystem dynamics, the increasingly central role of science in lawsuits and greater judicial awareness of the systemic nature of the problem are helping lawyers choose and structure their cases more carefully.Founded in 1971, the US NGO Earthjustice is no stranger to bringing environmental lawsuits in defence of wildlife and habitats. But, last summer, it launched a new initiative “laser-focused” on using the law to address major drivers of the biodiversity crisis.Timothy Preso, managing attorney of the organisation’s new biodiversity defense program, says it wants to partner with groups whose voices have been ignored in environmental litigation, such as indigenous and frontline communities, as well as raise awareness of critical biodiversity problems.The first case brought under the project was on behalf of the Ojibwe tribes of Wisconsin, challenging the state’s wolf hunting plans on the grounds that they conflict with treaties negotiated in the 19th century. “It raises really critical questions about wildlife management from the perspective of peoples who have been stewards of the environment in Wisconsin for about 15,000 years,” says Preso. “It’s a different approach to those issues.”Ojibwe tribes in Wisconsin have taken legal action to protect wolves. Photograph: Gary Kramer/APBiodiversity campaigners are also learning from the success of climate litigation, which, Futhazar says, has “initiated a new creative way of thinking about how to deal with the environment”.Zaneta Sedilekova, a lawyer at Clyde & Co, thinks biodiversity litigation will go through a similar arc to its climate counterpart, with campaigners targeting countries first and then companies.She sees pollination as being at the forefront of such cases because of its importance to food security, “an issue that Covid has really highlighted”. In 2019, Costa Rica’s supreme court ordered the country’s agriculture ministry to undertake a scientific study into the ecosystem impacts of neonicotinoids, while legal action has more recently been threatened against the French government for failing to implement strong regulations to curb the use of bee-harming pesticides.Just as the fossil fuel industry is now in the direct sight of climate litigants, biodiversity campaigners are targeting the private sector too. Last year, indigenous peoples from the Brazilian and Colombian Amazon and NGOs filed a lawsuit against French supermarket chain Groupe Casino for allegedly selling beef products linked to deforestation. Casino argued it took a “rigorous” approach to its supply chains.A protest in Marseille against the French supermarket chain Groupe Casino for allegedly selling meat products linked to deforestation. Photograph: Christophe Simon/AFP/GettyHeslop sees more corporate liability cases related to biodiversity on the horizon. “The traditional way of telling companies that they were doing the wrong thing environmentally was to convince them that they needed to have some corporate social responsibility,” she says. “But the approach we’ve now taken is to say, well actually you have a duty to your investors and they will be let down if you do this because you’ll end up with a stranded asset or you’ll be sued. We’ve made that narrative for climate and we’re currently looking at how those sorts of cases could be applied for biodiversity.”‘It’s about survival’: the Yorkshireman seeking justice for the Mariana dam disasterRead moreJust as attribution science is enabling climate campaigners to link the emission of greenhouse gases with the harms caused by subsequent global warming, Sedilekova says growing requirements for corporations to be transparent about their supply chains and to exercise due diligence will help draw a line between a product and biodiversity loss, and hold companies accountable.She adds that the “corporate veil” that has historically shielded parent companies from action against their subsidiaries is increasingly being lifted. “The more supply chain data we have, the easier it will be to trace that ecosystem damage to a jurisdiction which has fast and efficient judicial service or judicial provision which is not corrupted, and where the defendant has a lot of money.”Sedilekova admits it is still hard to persuade businesses that biodiversity litigation is a real risk, but argues that it could be a powerful tool to change corporate behaviour. “The importance of litigation is to not turn one ship around, but to set a precedent so that others don’t wait for it to happen to them.”In the Tagus estuary case, ClientEarth argues the project breaches EU law and could have catastrophic effects on the migratory birds. Heslop hopes the case will have a wider impact and could set a precedent for the protection of other species in the world. “Not just birds, but maybe dolphins or whales or others. That’s where what feels like a very local issue actually could have a huge impact if we’re successful,” she says.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",2022-03-16
 This article is more than 2 months old‘We can’t live in this’: the tightknit Chesterfield street devastated by floodingThis article is more than 2 months old,"Neighbours speak of heartbreak from row of terraces where Maureen Gilbert, 83, was found dead after Storm Babet","['Jessica Murray', ' Midlands correspondent']","Almost every square inch of the houses along Tapton Terrace in Chesterfield is covered in a thick layer of wet brown mud.Inside the homes, brown lines across the walls show that water levels reached a height of 1.5 metres (5ft).Wallpaper has been ripped off, carpets reduced to soaking rags, and piles of rubbish – once treasured belongings – have been dumped outside in the mud-caked street.“We had the flood defences up but the water came over the top and started pouring through the letterbox and broke the back door off. Well, you’ve got no hope by then,” said Lorna Squires, 56, who has lived in her house for 13 years.On Friday night the Derbyshire street was one of many inundated by flood water when the nearby River Rother burst its banks as Storm Babet battered the country.Neighbours have left flowers at the front door of Maureen Gilbert, who died when flood waters entered her home. Photograph: Andrew Fox/The Guardian“All we could hear all night was the furniture smashing, and the next morning there was so much debris in the garden we had to break our way out. And the mud. It’s horrendous, I’ve never seen anything like it,” said Squires.In the house two doors down lived Maureen Gilbert, 83, whose body was found in the flood water on the ground floor of her home on Saturday.It is thought she might have drowned as mobility issues meant she was unable to escape the rapidly rising water, which residents say took just 20 minutes to take hold.Her death has devastated the close-knit street, most of whom knew her and assumed she was safe in the upstairs of her home. Outside her front door, alongside the sandbags, neighbours had left bouquets of flowers in her memory.Her son, Paul, said he had built 4ft-high flood defences outside his mother’s home on Friday, and when he received a panicked phone call from her later in the day saying water levels were rising, he advised her to stay upstairs.Jill Benson’s cafe – about a mile from Tapton Terrace – has also been damaged by flooding. Photograph: Andrew Fox/The GuardianA broken window at the property shows where rescue teams had attempted to reach her, before deciding it was too dangerous to enter.“The water was nearly up to basically my eyes. I was hoping she’d got upstairs and everything was all right and that we’d see her the next morning,” he told Sky News.But when he returned at 9.30am on Saturday, he said he “came to the window, forced it open and found my mum floating in the water”.“I honestly can’t put it into words at the moment. There’s a bit of anger because nothing ever seems to get done. For me to have to come and find her myself was more the upsetting thing for me,” he said.Anne Squires, 38, Lorna’s daughter, who lives further up the street with her husband, Eliot, 48, and their son, Odin, 11, said Gilbert’s death had been hard to take.“It is upsetting. She’s always been here, she’s been through the floods with us all before,” she said.“A lot of us have said, if we had known she was still in that house and we knew she was downstairs, we would have risked our lives to fetch her out.”00:01:11Four dead after Storm Babet wreaks destruction across UK and Ireland – videoAnne Squires, who has a disability, said her car and two mobility scooters were ruined by the water, along with most of their belongings on the ground floor of the house.“I still haven’t even finished paying off my sofa and I checked the paperwork this morning and it’s not covered for flood damage. So I have to keep paying for it even though it’s ruined,” she said.Stephanie Winnard was one of many who installed flood defences at her home after flash flooding in June 2007, although the barriers proved futile in the face of the water levels, the highest ever recorded.“We thought it would be inches of water, if that, but no – we had 5ft of water. It came up the drains, the toilets, it comes from everywhere and you’ve got no chance,” Winnard said.Stephanie and David Winnard in their garden, which is covered in a thick layer of mud. Photograph: Andrew Fox/The Guardian“I put a few things on top of the table thinking it would be OK but it got everything. We can’t live in this and we’ll be out [of the house] for about a year I bet.”A fundraising appeal for the flood victims in Chesterfield has raised nearly £28,000 in a few days, but residents said there needs to be a longer-term solution to support them and prevent future flooding.“I am very worried about it happening again because they’re building on flood plains. It’s been 16 years since it last happened but it’s getting worse everywhere,” Winnard said.“I sometimes wish the council would just buy us out and flatten it. They’re going to have to do something.”“We need better flood defences, and the river needs dredging – we’ve been after that since 2007 and nothing has been done. It’s full of silt,” said Lorna Squires, who, like many on the road, was unable to afford home insurance when premiums were raised after previous flooding.But she said the closeness of the community on Tapton Terrace means she has no plans to leave, and will simply replace the items she has lost.“It is devastating but the way I see it, it’s material possessions and the expense of replacing it all is going to be astronomical,” she said. “But we lost our neighbour and this is nothing compared to the loss of a life.”",2023-10-24
 London teenagers' road signs highlight effect of toxic air on people of colour,Choked Up group demands action from mayoral candidates to tackle traffic pollution,['Matthew Taylor'],"A group of teenagers who live in some of London’s most polluted neighbourhoods are putting “hacked” road signs up across the capital to highlight the disproportionate impact that toxic air has on people of colour.Choked Up, a group who describe themselves as “black and brown teenagers from south London”, have set up the campaign, which is being backed by more than 100 doctors.Anjali Raman-Middleton, 17, a co-founder of the group, went to primary school with Ella Kissi-Debrah, who died in 2013 as a result of London’s air pollution crisis. “I’m terrified that my daily commute to school along the South Circular has already had a negative impact on my lungs,” she said. “I urge London mayoral candidates to commit to transform these roads to give me and my generation a greener future.”Choked Up are backed by more than 100 doctors. Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianThe guerrilla road signs read “pollution zone” and warn that “breathing kills”. They come just as new research from the Environmental Defense Fund Europe (EDF) is published showing that London’s poorest areas and black, Asian and minority ethnic communities are hit hardest by the toxic air.A group of 100 London health professionals who work in the NHS have backed the call for action with a letter to the capital’s mayoral candidates, urging them to commit to tackling air pollution inequalities and to develop an “urgent action plan to … reduce our dependence on cars”.UK has broken air pollution limits for a decade, EU court findsRead moreLevels of air pollution across the capital are “a public health emergency”, according to Dr Laura Jane Smith, a respiratory consultant at King’s College hospital and one of the signatories of the letter organised by Medact.“There are far too many people in our hospital wards and clinics who might otherwise be healthy if it wasn’t for the toxic air they breathe,” Smith said “Air pollution affects every single one of us from birth to old age, but we know the least well off and marginalised communities, including those from black and Asian backgrounds, are being hardest hit.”A growing body of research underlines the devastating impact that air pollution – both indoors and outdoors – is having on the nation’s health. Recent studies suggest it may be damaging every organ in the body, with effects including heart and lung disease, diabetes, dementia, reduced intelligence and increased depression. Children and unborn babies may suffer the most.Air pollution disproportionately affects minority ethnic communities, campaigners say. Photograph: Choked UpThe EDF study highlighted the uneven impact of air pollution, with nitrogen dioxide (NO2) 24-31% higher in areas of London where people from black, Asian or minority ethnic backgrounds are most likely to live. Additionally, it found the most deprived Londoners are more than six times more likely to live in areas with higher pollution than the least deprived.Choked Up is calling on the mayoral candidates to dramatically improve air quality along the capital’s major roads, the so-called “red routes”, which make up 5% of London’s roads but carry a third of its traffic.Choked Up co-founders, from left, Nyeleti Brauer-Maxaeia, Anjali Raman-Middleton, Destiny Boka Batesa.

We need a green recovery that undoes decades of damage, using a clear traffic reduction plan – one where polluting trucks can no longer cut across the city and parking for cars becomes parks for people.”",2021-03-11
 This article is more than 7 months oldUK heatwave prompts National Grid to fire up coal plant to meet aircon demandThis article is more than 7 months old,National Grid asks for two units at Ratcliffe-on-Soar plant to be brought into action after temperature tops 30C,['Alex Lawson'],"National Grid has broken a 46-day run in which coal has not been used to generate electricity in Britain in order to meet extra demand for air conditioning as the country swelters in hot weather.The grid’s electricity system operator (ESO) asked Uniper, the owner of Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station in Nottinghamshire, to start producing power from the coal-fired plant, prompting criticism from green campaigners.Temperatures broke 30C for the first time this year over the weekend and meteorologists forecast the chance of Britain experiencing a hot summer was 45% – 2.3 times the typical figure.The hot weather is expected to push up demand for power, as households and businesses switch on air conditioning units. Air conditioning accounts for about a fifth of the total electricity used in buildings around the world.One unit at the Ratcliffe plant was brought into action on Monday morning, with a second unit warmed up to cover the evening peak in power demand.The consultancy LCP Delta said wind generation was low on Monday and planned maintenance at the Torness nuclear power station on the east coast of Scotland, which began on Sunday night, had reduced available generation by a further 1.3 gigawatts.Last week, a fault was found on the 1,400-megawatt North Sea Link interconnector that carries power between Norway and the UK, cutting electricity supplies. The power flowing through the 450-mile subsea cable has been reduced by half while the fault, discovered at an onshore facility in Norway, is repaired.The decision to turn to the fossil fuel angered green campaigners. Ami McCarthy, Greenpeace UK’s political campaigner, said: “It is a sign of failure that the National Grid is turning to one of the most polluting forms of power generation to deal with a summer heatwave that we know has been made worse because of climate change.”She added: “The government must get to work and upgrade our energy grid. In summer, we should be turning to solar power, yet we currently have renewable energy going to waste because our grid cannot transmit the power, and hundreds of renewables projects which are on hold because they can’t get connected.”National Grid has previously advised consumers to improve the energy efficiency of air conditioning by changing or cleaning the machine’s reusable filter, closing windows and doors and by shutting curtains to block the sun’s light and heat coming into the home.Ratcliffe-on-Soar was among the coal-fired power stations put on standby to provide extra power by the ESO over the winter amid concerns that a cold snap and a reduction in gas from Russia to Europe could lead to rolling blackouts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The network operator said last month that households and businesses saved enough power over the winter to power 10m homes.",
 Rattlesnakes thrive in California amid increasingly hot temperatures,"Study finds Pacific rattlesnakes, which can’t control their own temperature, prefer places where the climate averages 80F",['Katharine Gammon'],"Many species are suffering at the hands of a warmer world, but one California inhabitant seems to be enjoying hotter temperatures: the Pacific rattlesnake. Their populations across the south-west are thriving, according to a study by researchers at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and the University of Michigan.The study found that when given the choice, rattlesnakes – which cannot control their own temperature and rely on the environment for warmth – actually prefer to live in places where the climate averages more than 80F, suggesting they’re likely to do well as the planet gets hotter.“The moral of the story is that as temperatures rise, it approaches the snakes’ optimal temperature,” says Hayley Crowell, lead author of the study, which was released last year. “That’s a favorable change for these snakes.”Crowell and her colleagues didn’t set out to investigate climate change – they wanted to know more about physiology and thermal ecology of rattlesnakes: how they warm up and cool down, comparing seven species of rattlesnakes living in coastal areas and central California. They wondered how the same snake can live in cool foggy areas and high arid deserts, considering they can’t control their own temperature.The researchers implanted small temperature loggers – about the size and shape of a watch battery – inside the snakes to record how warm they were. They found the average internal temperature of coastal rattlesnakes is usually 70F, while inland rattlers have an average of 74F.They also brought snakes into the lab and set them in a box that had different temperature areas, letting the snakes pick where they wanted to sit. Given the choice, the snakes preferred their body temperature at a balmy 86 to 89F – much higher than their temperature in nature. “All the snakes were choosing higher temps,” says Crowell, “warmer than where they were living.”Being warm brings with it certain benefits: the snakes can spend more time out of hibernation, more time growing, and more time reproducing. They typically hibernate from September to May, but this could shorten in the future. Even on a given day, the snakes could have more active hours as the temperatures rise.The snakes digest very slowly, and need to eat only about 500 to 600 calories a year – the equivalent of a single ground squirrel. (Humans, on the other hand, need more than 1,300 times more calories to survive.)While warmer temperatures may make it easier on their bodies, the changing climate can threaten snakes in other ways, Crowell says. More heat can mean more fires, less available water during mega-droughts, and it might not be great for ground squirrels, which happens to be the food rattlesnakes are specialized to eat. There’s also a tradeoff of staying in the sun to bask for too long: a hawk might see the snake and go in for a meal.Rising temperatures could mean more snakes in the future, but not an overwhelming number: “I don’t think there will be thousands more snakes,” she says. “You might see more, if their food allows it.”Each year, about 300 Californians a year are bitten by rattlesnakes, according to the California Poison Control System, though the risk of death from a rattlesnake is lower than the risk from a dog attack or a lighting strike.Overall, rattlesnakes are ideal model organisms for examining the physiological effects of climate on cold-blooded animals, the researchers say – because their life-history traits, simple behaviors, and metabolism are well studied.Crowell is now studying how snakes deal with different environments and balance their water uptake. She also wants to know how their colors – which differ widely between different areas – play a role in their heating and cooling systems.Rattlesnakes are some of the most hearty creatures around, she says: “They have a pretty wide thermal tolerance, a super low metabolism, only eat a half-dozen meals per year,” she says. “So they are pretty content just hanging out, as long as it’s not too hot or too cold.”",2022-05-27
LettersEngland’s water crisis should be blamed on privatisation,"The Labour MP Dr Jack Cunningham warned of the dangers of water privatisation three decades ago, writes Preston Witts. Plus letters from Pam Lunn, Robert Kelso, Brian Marshall, Alan Couchman and Amanda Epps",['Letters'],"The crisis facing the nation’s water supply because of the drought (Ban bonuses for water firm bosses until they fix leaky pipes, say Lib Dems, 8 August) reminds me of the words of Dr Jack Cunningham MP, who was Labour’s shadow environment secretary at the time of water privatisation in 1989.As the bill to privatise the water industry in England and Wales was going through parliament, I interviewed Dr Cunningham for a political programme called Agenda transmitted by Television South. Dr Cunningham (now Baron Cunningham of Felling) said it was appalling that a natural resource like water should be put in the hands of people with a profit motive. It was unbelievable, he said, that the provision of such a resource should be subjected to commercial criteria like any other commodity. He thought the ultimate losers would be the public.Twenty-eight years later, in 2017, opinion polling indicated that 83% of the British public would like to see renationalisation of all water services. In the same year, research by the University of Greenwich suggested that consumers in England were paying £2.3bn more every year for their water and sewerage than they would be if the water companies had remained under state ownership. As the disaster of water privatisation becomes ever clearer, I think Lord Cunningham has every reason to say: “I told you so.”Preston WittsBidford-on-Avon, Warwickshire I would go further than the Lib Dems’ proposal: set tough legal requirements, and create the means to police them adequately, to fix leaks, build reservoirs, and curb the discharge of untreated sewage into rivers and coastal areas. Create a deadline and make it clear that if the targets have not been met, swingeing fines will be issued, equal to the total value of the company.In other words, fix the problems or you’ll be nationalised with no compensation. At that point “shareholder value” is maximised not by profits continuing to go to bonuses and dividends at the expense of consumers, but by preventing the company’s value being reduced to zero as a result of fines. So that will mean no bonuses or dividends, but all operating profits to be ploughed back into the necessary improvements. If the targets are achieved, normal business can be resumed, as long as the new infrastructure is maintained and incrementally improved.That should fix it, and the model could be applied to other failing industries that were formerly publicly owned utilities.Pam LunnKenilworth, Warwickshire Based on the figures given for baths and showers in your article (Flushing the loo to gardening: how to save water around the home, 9 August), baths seem to use less water, especially if someone gets in after you.

LettersWhy building homes on golf courses is a terrible idea,"John R Fox, John Moore and Mike Stein respond to an article by Phineas Harper on housebuilding ",,"Phineas Harper has missed a serious point regarding golf courses (Building houses on Britain’s vast, exclusive golf courses makes sense for everyone – even golfers, 28 November). They are corridors for wildlife and green havens for fixing carbon as well as providing a healthy leisure activity for local communities. At my golf club, in the past three years we have installed more than 80 nest boxes (including raptor boxes), developed five wildflower zones, encouraged wildlife with bird-feeding stations, left felled branches and logs in wooded areas for insects and fungi to thrive, and allowed grass to grow wild at the edge of  fairways.My club has been accredited by the Golf Environment Organization for its sustainability and social responsibility.May I suggest that housebuilding policies should focus on using brownfield sites, which are more suitable for repurposing, and reusing buildings and land that has previously been developed, rather than undeveloped land or greenfield sites.John R FoxLiverpool Phineas Harper’s contention that building on golf courses would help tackle our chronic lack of housing and also let the sport shed its elitist tag is flawed. This would lead to a huge loss of green spaces that are enjoyed by golfers and walkers alike, given that many golf courses have public footpaths running through them, and would also have an environmental impact.It also ignores the obvious fact that golf courses are often on land that is exposed, undulating or otherwise unsuitable for development.

Britain loves swans. So why do we cause them untold harm?,These elegant birds have long held a special place in the nation’s heart and imagination. But now they are dying in untold numbers,"['Stephen Moss', '@stephenmoss_tv']","To the British, the swan is not so much a bird as a national treasure – the avian equivalent of Dame Judi Dench or Sir David Attenborough. Its unique status is a result of its long and complex history living alongside us, a relationship that goes back well over a thousand years.Alarm at reports last week that dozens of swans and cygnets have died of bird flu in Shakespeare’s home town of Stratford-upon-Avon – up to half of the town’s population – reminded us just how passionate the British public are about the bird.Swans are both more vulnerable than many other birds to the disease, and being so large and obvious, when they do have symptoms more likely to get noticed. The town’s former mayor, Cyril Bennis, who has been campaigning on behalf of the local swans for four decades, has described the deaths as “heartbreaking”.The swans in Stratford – and the species we usually see on our park ponds, lakes, rivers and gravel pits – are mute swans; yet despite this name, they can and do make a wide range of sounds. “Mute” was chosen to contrast with the whooper swan which, as its name suggests, makes a loud, honking call when in flight.What is not so well known is that the mute swan used to be called the “tame swan”. This was partly to distinguish it from the two species of “wild swan” – the whooper and its smaller cousin, the Bewick’s – both of which are winter visitors to Britain from Iceland, Scandinavia and Siberia. The description “tame” was applied because, for more than a millennium from the Anglo-Saxon era through to the 19th century, swans were farmed in swanneries. Today, only one of these, at Abbotsbury in Dorset, survives.Natalie Portman as Nina in the film Black Swan. Photograph: Fox Searchlight/AllstarSwans were kept not simply as a source of feathers and meat (the tender cygnets being preferred to the adults’ much tougher, gamier flesh), but also as a status symbol; owning them was in the gift of the monarch, who would bestow on favoured nobles the right to keep swans. Such was the value of these magnificent birds that to kill a swan was classed as treason, and taking even a single egg could result in a year’s imprisonment.The fact that swans were in the gift of the crown led to another myth – that all Britain’s swans are owned by the Queen. They are not; although the annual swan-upping ceremony on the River Thames, in which the year’s new cygnets are caught and marked, does denote royal ownership of some.A poster for Disney’s 1939 Ugly Duckling. Photograph: LMPC/Getty ImagesUnlike most birds, swans are indeed very tame. Sometimes they may approach closer than you would prefer, especially if you are on their territory in the breeding season. And although the belief that a swan can break a man’s arm with a single blow of its wing is another myth, when a large male shuffles towards you with wings outstretched, hissing loudly, it can be pretty scary. As the Queen’s official swan warden, Professor Christopher Perrins, points out, not everybody likes swans.Not surprisingly for such a huge and noticeable bird, swans feature more than almost any other species in myths and legends, art and literature, across much of the northern hemisphere.Ancient swan myths include Leda and the Swan. This dates back to ancient Greece, when the all-powerful god Zeus supposedly turned himself into a swan so that he could approach – and then seduce – Leda, Queen of Sparta. This story has featured prominently in art, poems and music by, among others, Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, WB Yeats and Lou Reed, all of whom were seemingly captivated by the taboo subject of sex between a swan and a woman.Perhaps the most celebrated depiction of swans is in Tchaikovsky’s stunning Swan Lake, the most performed, and possibly best-loved, ballet of all time. As well as the wonderful music, its popularity is surely also due to the visual beauty of the white swan at the heart of the story. A darker side to swans was explored in the 2010 film Black Swan, starring Natalie Portman, a tale of rivalry and madness, which swept the board at the following year’s Oscars.Mutating Australian white ibis could diverge from its rural cousins, or save them, scientists sayRead moreAmid all this history, mythology and culture, it is easy to forget that the swan is a real bird which, despite its size, can also be extremely vulnerable. As well as suffering from bird flu, swans can die from attacks by dogs, plastic waste, discarded fishing tackle, collisions with pylons or wind turbines, and – a very current threat – waterways polluted with raw sewage.At the end of the first lockdown in summer 2020, there was also a steep rise in the number of swans being deliberately killed with airguns and catapults – often leaving behind cygnets to starve to death. As a nation we may love swans, but we also cause them untold harm.The Swan: A Biography, by Stephen Moss (Square Peg) is out now.

" This article is more than 10 months oldPlan to incinerate soil from Ohio train derailment is ‘horrifying’, says expertThis article is more than 10 months old","Soil is being sent to a nearby incinerator with a history of clean air violations, raising fears the chemicals will be redistributed",['Tom Perkins'],"Contaminated soil from the site around the East Palestine train wreck in Ohio is being sent to a nearby incinerator with a history of clean air violations, raising fears that the chemicals being removed from the ground will be redistributed across the region.The new plan is “horrifying”, said Kyla Bennett, a former Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) official now with the Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility non-profit. She is one among a number of public health advocates and local residents who have slammed Norfolk Southern and state and federal officials over the decision.‘Crafting an illusion’: US rail firms’ multimillion-dollar PR pushRead more“Why on earth would you take this already dramatically overburdened community and ship this stuff a few miles away only to have it deposited right back where it came from?” Bennett asked.Incinerating the soil is especially risky because some of the contaminants that residents and independent chemical experts fear is in the waste, like dioxins and PFAS, haven’t been tested for by the EPA, and they do not incinerate easily, or cannot be incinerated.A Norfolk Southern train carrying vinyl chloride used to produce PVC plastic derailed on 3 February in the small industrial town of 4,700 people, located at the edge of the Appalachian hills in Ohio.As the fire threatened to ignite tankers full of the chemical days later, emergency responders, fearing a major explosion, conducted a controlled burn of the substance.Environmental researchers say the combustion of vinyl chloride almost certainly created dioxins, a highly toxic chemical that can remain in the environment for years. However, the EPA has resisted calls to test for it, and the agency removed from its website the results of its in-depth soil analyses, so it’s unclear which chemicals are in the soil.Chemicals like dioxins must be incinerated at extremely high temperatures, and the combustion of some substances can be difficult or unpredictable during incineration, said Carsten Prasse, an environmental health professor at Johns Hopkins University who focuses on risk science. Those issues are generating uncertainty about the plan’s safety.“My concern is basically do we just translate the issue that’s right now in the soil into another medium by blowing it into the air?” he asked. “That is not necessarily the case, but I’m not sure that we can exclude this at this point, so it is an issue.”The ground also likely contains PFAS, informally called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down, and no human-made method to destroy the compounds has been fully developed.“The effectiveness of incineration to destroy PFAS compounds and the tendency for formation of fluorinated or mixed halogenated organic byproducts is not well understood,” the EPA has written.Still, it is putting residents’ health at risk by sending potentially PFAS-contaminated soil to the incinerator, Bennett said.“The most important thing in my mind is the human health and health of the environment, so right now that should be priority number one, and things like this fly in the face of basic human decency and science,” she added.The incinerator, owned by Heritage Thermal Services, is already burning PFAS waste from the Department of Defense, which prompted a federal lawsuit from a coalition of local environmental groups. Heritage also faced an investigation and enforcement action from the EPA in 2015 after officials determined the facility had violated the Clean Air Act nearly 200 times between 2010 and 2014.Among the chemicals that had been released at dangerous levels was dioxin, and among the issues cited by the EPA were a failure by Heritage to maintain a required minimum temperature, raising questions about whether the facility can handle more dioxin and PFAS waste.The facility has also recorded air quality violations in eight of the last 12 quarters, EPA records show.Local environmental groups have been fighting with Heritage over its emissions since the incinerator was built in the 1990s, said Amanda Kiger, director of River Valley Organizing. She has been assisting residents in East Palestine about 15 miles north, but lives near the incinerator in East Liverpool, both of which are in Columbiana county.“[Environmental officials] are just dumping more shit on Columbiana county,” Kiger said. “They say, ‘We already poisoned them so it doesn’t matter if we poison them more.’”In a statement to news outlets, Heritage said it is “providing support at the site in accordance with the cleanup plan approved by government agencies with jurisdiction over the response to the event”.East Palestine’s waste disposal has raised fresh questions about the disposal of toxic substances. Some of the waste is being sent to incinerators around Ohio, while about 1.5m gallons of wastewater is being injected into wells deep into the Earth’s crust near Houston. Deep wells can leak waste into groundwater, and are thought to cause earthquakes.Meanwhile, some contaminated soil was shipped to a Michigan landfill with a history of discharging PFAS into a public sewer system. A state-of-the-art incinerator in Arkansas is likely equipped to more safely handle the East Palestine waste, Kiger said.“But how do you say, ‘Not in my backyard – give it to someone else’?” she asked. “They got us fighting each other.”",2023-03-04
ReviewNomad Century: How to Survive the Climate Upheaval by Gaia Vince review – a world without borders,"In an optimistic new work, the author of Adventures in the Anthropocene argues that planned mass migration is essential for humanity to inhabit a world 4C warmer",['Bob Ward'],"Gaia Vince’s new book should be read not just by every politician, but by every person on the planet, because it lays out, much more clearly than any existing scientific assessment, the world we are creating through global heating.Nomad Century is the much-anticipated follow-up to Vince’s award-winning book, Adventures in the Anthropocene, which explained how human impacts on Earth have created a new geological epoch. In this new work, the author makes the pessimistic, but entirely plausible, assumption that by the end of this century the Earth will be 4C warmer than during the period before industrialisation. And while this may sound like the stuff of nightmares, she also offers an optimistic vision of how humans might cope after rendering large swathes of the globe uninhabitable – through massive migration towards the poles.The early chapters outline a dystopian future, based on scientific projections of a world that will soon be warmer than at any time for tens of millions of years. This, she says, is what awaits us if we carry on failing to drastically reduce our emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases: coastlines will be transformed by rising sea levels and stronger tropical storms, forests razed by wildfires, drought-stricken fields will lie barren, and deserts will expand to swallow up villages and towns. Other communities will be wiped out by terrible floods, or abandoned because of a lack of rainfall.In a growing zone around the equator, temperature and humidity will be so high that people will be unable to prevent themselves from overheating through sweating, making it dangerous to undertake any strenuous activity outdoors. Faced with such an inhospitable environment, Vince argues, humans will do what we have been doing throughout our evolutionary history: we will move. But this time it will be in our billions, on a scale never seen before.Gaia Vince: the UN should offer global citizenship to everybody, she says. Photograph: Sent by publishersMost of these migrants will try to move north from the tropics, seeking to settle eventually in countries such as Canada and Russia, where the climate will have changed but which will still be inhabitable. This flow of humanity has already started, and will only increase over the coming decades. Some will move because their livelihoods have been destroyed by the changing climate, others will be refugees who have lost their homes to extreme weather events that have become more frequent and intense.Vince provides a short history of human migration, explaining that it has been key to the success of our species in settling across the globe. Without migration, modern humans would never have ventured beyond their origin in Africa. The author then moves on to a passionate and powerful presentation of the benefits of migration. She highlights the wealth of evidence showing that it enriches both migrants and their destinations and attacks the rhetoric of British politicians and media who seek to demonise asylum seekers who arrive on our shores.We do now have to contemplate an extraordinary future in which the impacts of climate change make the migration of billions inevitableShe points out that the creation of political boundaries to prevent people from moving unchecked about the globe is a relatively new development in human history. It is, in many ways, an unnatural restriction of our fundamental freedoms. She also illustrates the desperation of many current migrants by describing her visit to the Kutupalong refugee camp in Bangladesh, where hundreds of thousands of Rohingya have sought sanctuary from persecution in Myanmar. She notes that the camp is in effect a poorly planned city in which human potential is being wasted, breeding a sense of hopelessness.But it does not have to be this way, Vince argues. The coming migration of billions of people from the tropics can be planned, with new cities constructed to accommodate the climate migrants and provide them with the opportunity to build new lives. Already across the world there has been a mass exodus from the countryside to cities, but unplanned urban development had led to a proliferation of slums and shantytowns. However, China has more successfully managed the flow of about 400 million people into its cities over the past three decades through huge construction and infrastructure programmes.There are plenty of examples in which large populations of migrants have been successfully integrated into their new communities through enlightened policymaking. The Neukölln neighbourhood of Berlin, for instance, welcomed tens of thousands of refugees from Syria’s brutal civil war, creating new jobs and economic opportunities.Vince makes clear that political hostility to migrants is often based on prejudice rather than fact. Millions of refugees from Ukraine have been accepted by European countries that simultaneously claim they cannot possibly cope with the influx of smaller numbers across the Mediterranean. One way of ensuring a more just treatment of climate migrants, she suggests, is for the United Nations to create a new organisation for global migration, and to offer global citizenship to everybody alongside their national citizenships.Vince’s deeply humane vision of facilitated mass migration may seem unrealistic against the current backdrop of hysteria about asylum seekers in many parts of Europe and the United States. But we do now have to contemplate an extraordinary future in which the impact of global heating makes the migration of billions inevitable. Unfortunately, the same politicians who are failing to deal properly with migration are the same ones we are depending on to avoid dangerous climate breakdown.Gaia Vince: humans have caused untold damage to the planetRead moreVince is optimistic about our chances of successfully managing the massive dislocation caused by warming of 4C, and does not dwell on the alternative: a world that does not cope with the displacement of billions of people. The result would be widespread and perpetual conflict across the world, and a tragic new chapter of suffering in human history.Bob Ward is policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science

 This article is more than 5 months oldWhat frightens me about the climate crisis is we don’t know how bad things really areThis article is more than 5 months oldRoger Harrabin,"As the barrage of bad news from places like Greece continues, all we can be certain of is there are many surprises lying ahead",,"Over the past few decades, climate scientists have made huge strides in understanding the future climate. But after recent weeks of extreme heat and devastating floods it’s clear that, although climate models have provided good information about overall rising temperatures, they can’t be sure what level of destruction each notch on the thermometer will bring.Climate modelling is extremely complex, but its fundamentals rely on basic physics – X tonnes of emissions will bring Y increase in temperature, with some error bars. Supercomputers have been able to factor in shifts in land use that will change the reflectivity of the Earth’s surface. Improved temperature records helped verify their findings.But lately, leading researchers have made a painful confession: even their most sophisticated models can’t yet foresee exactly how Earth systems will respond to those higher temperatures.The influential Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says cranking up global temperature by half a degree will bring much more extreme weather, and it can be more often, more intense, or extended in duration – but exactly how much more, it can’t precisely say.So, for instance, we’ve already had a global temperature rise of about 1.2C: that’s in line with IPCC projections. Yet the panel couldn’t warn us about the appalling heat dome that’s been searing North America. I can’t find heat domes mentioned in the bible of climate change, the IPCC report. This periodic report inevitably lags behind new science and – under pressure from some governments and industries, as well as a desire not to scaremonger – its pronouncements tend to be conservative.The models also couldn’t warn us accurately about the emergence of the heat trapped deep in the ocean, which soaks up 90% of the world’s excess warmth. In the 35 years I covered the environment for the BBC, I recall speculation that the warmth could stay deep for decades, perhaps centuries – not that some of it would suddenly burst up to the surface off the coast of northern Britain.Major uncertainties remain, too, over rainfall. Good information about the future of monsoon rain would be a godsend for farmers who rely upon it – not just in India but in southern China. Unfortunately, good information on precipitation is proving a bit tricky to find.The macro models also failed to project the effect of current elevated temperatures on ice at both poles. The former IPCC chief, Prof Bob Watson, told me: “I am very concerned. None of the observed changes so far (with a 1.2C temperature rise) are surprising. But they are more severe than we predicted 20 years ago, and more severe than the predictions of five years ago. We probably underestimated the consequences.”This is a massive admission. He added: “Scientists are only now starting to understand the response of large ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica – and it is very disturbing.”Prof Jane Francis, director of the British Antarctic Survey, told me a few months ago the latest science on ice melt was “truly scary”.‘The US has considered itself less vulnerable. But tell that to people in Phoenix trapped under that heat dome.’ Photograph: Matt York/APWatson said at current rates the world would almost certainly exceed the agreed maximum temperature rise of 1.5-2C. We would be lucky to get away with 2.5C, he said. More likely, we’re heading towards 3C.That number positively frightens many climate scientists. But, as India starts stockpiling rice with a temperature rise of 1.2C, what useful advice can scientists offer for a 3C world? Just how bad will things be by then?Should holidaymakers avoid buying homes in Greece? China is vulnerable to extremes – how should its economy adapt? The US has considered itself less vulnerable. But tell that to New Yorkers choking on wildfire smoke, or people in Phoenix trapped under that heat dome.While immediate harm to people grabs the headlines, what’s even more destructive could be the impact of heat and humidity on food production for an expanding population. A global shift towards a plant-based diet could halve the land and water used for agriculture – and halve the carbon emissions – but politicians fear angering voters by recommending a dietary shift.Facing all this gloom means we need imagineers as well as climatologists. Watson said civilisation will still exist in the future, but with much worse living conditions. But what sort of a degraded civilisation might that be? By then we may even have triggered some natural tipping points that could result in a massive release of trapped methane in the tundra – let’s hope not.As Greece burns, we see the existential climate crisis dragged into shoddy UK party politics. That can’t happen | John Harris Read moreWhat we do know is that so far, the effects of heating the climate are sooner and worse than many scientists projected (in public at least). This has policy implications. The world has agreed to cut emissions to net zero by 2050, but the UN secretary general, António Guterres, says rich countries should be aiming to squeeze the timetable to 2040. But what is the use of a net zero policy if it relies in part on planting trees that may shrivel in future drought or crackle in wildfire?To make matters worse, climate heating is one thing on a list of huge environmental problems – including pollution of the air and water, destruction of wildlife habitats, overfishing, insect population declines, loss of birds, plastic pollution, nitrates, soil loss and more.Watson says we don’t know how these phenomena will interact with each other, but he urges politicians to err on the side of caution, as the stakes are so very high. Every 0.1C warming matters, scientists say: 1.5C is better than 1.6C. That in turn is less bad than 1.7C.As the barrage of bad news continues, all we can be certain of is that there are many climate surprises lying ahead of us. Governments, companies and individuals need to urgently squeeze down emissions to insulate ourselves as far as possible from what we may face.

,These are the arguments spun by big beef titans to persuade consumers that meat eating has negligible impact on the planet,"['Supported by', 'About this content']","It’s a hard, unpalatable, disorienting truth: if we’re serious about avoiding the worst scenarios of the climate crisis, people – particularly those who live in wealthier nations – need to consume fewer animal products.Inside big beef’s climate messaging machine: confuse, defend and downplayRead moreBut for the corporate titans who stand atop the nearly trillion-dollar global meat industry, this modest change represents an existential threat, which is why they’re spinning the truth about the full climate impacts of animal agriculture.In the Guardian’s review of dozens of industry-aligned articles, op-eds, fact sheets, blog posts, informational videos, educational assets and social media messages, several themes repeatedly surfaced. Taken together, this vast body of industry-funded messaging works to perpetuate five myths to suggest that beef production is not a problem for the climate, and cutting consumption will not help – and may even hurt – environmental progress.Myth 1: fossil fuels are the only real problem to fix“What we eat matters environmentally to some degree, but it pales compared to what we drive or how we use energy,” Frank Mitloehner, a UC Davis animal scientist, who works with the beef industry on research and messaging, said in a 2018 article for the industry publication Meatingplace. “So, have the burger. Just make sure you walk to the restaurant.”The implication – made repeatedly in Mitloehner’s blog posts and public comments and reinforced through industry marketing materials – is that the impacts of energy use so far outweigh agricultural-related emissions that we might as well not worry about what we eat.It’s true that fossil fuels have been the primary driver of the climate crisis. According to most estimates, all of agriculture – not just livestock – is responsible for one-quarter to one-third of global emissions, while energy consumption for transport, industry and heating contributes the bulk of the rest. For that reason, some experts, like University of Pennsylvania climatologist Michael Mann, argue that we should laser-focus on transforming the energy sector. Once we’ve done that, Mann has said, we can argue about food.But other experts disagree.A chart showing how agriculture is the second-largest source of emissionsWhile fossil fuel consumption has done the most to put us on our dangerous path to climate catastrophe, a widely cited 2020 study in the journal Science argued that we can no longer avoid the worst of the climate crisis by cutting fossil fuels alone. Staying below the average global temperature rise of 2C – a threshold that scientists say will lead to systems collapse, mass extinctions, fatal heat waves, drought and famine, water shortages and flooded cities – will require “rapid and ambitious” changes to food systems.The single most impactful food-related change we can make, according to their findings, is not increasing yields, ramping up agricultural efficiency or cutting food waste, though those approaches all would help. It’s adopting a plant-rich diet.While building out energy infrastructure can take years, changing our diet is something we can work toward today.“Whenever you model out having the world manage massive climate change, you pretty much have to build in dietary moderation for people in wealthy countries,” said Tim Searchinger, a senior research fellow at Princeton who studies the climate costs of agriculture. “No one can get there without that.”Myth 2: methane is different – and it isn’t the problemMethane – the greenhouse gas cattle emit in their belches – is highly potent. Since its warming potential is 28 times higher over 100 years than carbon dioxide’s, every ton of methane emitted impacts the climate over two dozen times more than a ton of carbon dioxide. When measured in a shorter time frame, over the course of just 20 years, methane’s impact is even more dramatic, causing about 85 times more warming a ton than CO2.But industry messaging works to systematically downplay this impact, mostly by pointing out that methane only persists in the atmosphere for about a decade. In contrast, every ton of CO2 emitted sticks around for generations.“Every time you’ve ever driven a car, or burned coal or gas,” Mitloehner said in an interview published by the trade group Dairy Farmers of Canada, “you’ve put out CO2 into the atmosphere and that gas is still there throughout your entire lifetime – and that of your parents, and that of your grandparents, and so on.”graph depicting methane emissions Sara Place, a former executive of National Cattlemen’s Beef Association (NCBA) and a student of Mitloehner who is now a professor of animal sciences at Colorado State University, has told audiences that carbon dioxide builds up like water in a tub when the faucet is set to the max – overwhelming the drain’s ability to clear out – while methane is like running the faucet at a flow speed low enough to drain right away. As long as emissions stay constant, we lose methane about as fast as we pollute with it; therefore, cattle aren’t actually adding net emissions, she argues.But using that argument to dissuade people from eating less beef makes no sense. If we reduce the overall number of cattle being raised worldwide, the climate gains from that reduction are more or less immediate, thanks to methane’s short half-life. To use Place’s metaphor, it’s like slowing the faucet’s rate of flow while keeping the drain open, so that the water seeps out faster than it comes in. Significantly reducing global cattle stocks through a shift to other nutritious foods, then, could lead to rapid cooling – one of the most powerful levers available to slow climate crisis right now, this moment.Responding to questions from the Guardian, Mitloehner said he could not recall “ever downplaying methane”. Mitloehner said: “I have gone on record many times about the problems associated with methane and the great need we have to reduce it. I stress this each time I speak to or work with agriculture groups. However, I go beyond just informing members of the agriculture sector that they need to reduce their emissions; I work with them to get it done.”Emitting methane will always be worse than emitting the same quantity of carbon dioxide, no matter the time scaleUniversity of Melbourne researchersHe added: “Let me say this clearly. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and managing it appropriately will limit warming.”Still, beef advocates frequently use his statements about methane to minimize the potency of cattle emissions – and suggest only fossil fuels are worth worrying about. But other climate scientists warn that we shouldn’t take methane reduction off the table.As University of Melbourne researchers put it: “Emitting methane will always be worse than emitting the same quantity of carbon dioxide, no matter the time scale.”Myth 3: eating beef isn’t a problem in the USIn 2019, researchers from the US Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) published the first cradle-to-grave life-cycle analysis of emissions from US cattle, factoring in everything from the climate costs of feed production to the methane emitted by the animals themselves. (The study was funded, in part, by the beef checkoff.) Their central finding: beef production contributes only 3.3% of the nation’s overall climate footprint.In a press release published by ARS, Alan Rotz, the study’s lead author claimed that the findings showed US cattle are “not a significant contributor to long-term global warming”. The study didn’t actually make that judgment, only Rotz’s public comments did. But that didn’t stop Mitloehner and other industry advocates from using this number to suggest that cattle aren’t really the problem.graph showing how meat products account for double the emissions of plant-based products“To those who think beef consumption must be lowered to protect the climate: the 3.3% GHG LCA figure for beef stands in sharp contrast to over 70% of all US GHG emissions stemming from the nation’s fossil fuel sectors (i.e. power, transportation, and industry),” he wrote in a 2019 tweet. Elsewhere, Mitloehner has suggested that the number is so vanishingly small that it’s not worth worrying about. In comments to the Guardian, Mitloehner said: “Livestock impacts on the environment are absolutely important and it’s reflected in the work I do.” Why is it wrong to suggest cattle’s 3.3% impact is insignificant? Because a small percentage of a big thing is still a big thing. And considering that America’s net emissions are the second highest in the world, the fact that a single food product could take up 3.3% of that disproportionately large pie is still staggering. For context, 243m tons of CO2 equivalent gasses – the total amount generated by US cattle each year, according to ARS – is roughly equivalent to the greenhouse gas footprint of the entire 47-million-person nation of Spain.Myth 4: cattle are raised on lands where nothing else can grow anywayIt’s true that well-managed ruminant populations can be a helpful, symbiotic relationship with grassland ecosystems, where their manure and migration patterns help to restore soil. In these environments, raising cattle can be much better for the environment – if they’re not allowed to overgraze – than plowing to grow crops. This isn’t an argument for cattle, necessarily: deer, elk, bison and other species can also provide these ecosystem services, while also being a source of human food.And yet millions of cattle are grazed in places that are not native grasslands. All over the world, forests, wetlands, woody savannas and other ecosystems have been cleared to make room for cattle or growing cattle feed. In those cases, grazing livestock tends to have a much more destructive impact because of what experts call “the opportunity cost of land”, in other words, factor in the carbon we’re not capturing by letting these ecosystems be.graph depicting how land-use and farm activities account for the largest share of emissions for most animal products, including beef“The overwhelming greenhouse gas costs from agriculture comes from our land use,” says Searchinger, who is also the technical director of the food program at the non-profit thinktank World Resources Institute. “There’s a huge amount of carbon in the atmosphere because it’s no longer in the land that was entered into agriculture.”Searchinger says that roughly a third of grazing land worldwide was once forested or heavily wooded – and could still be today. Forests are a key ally in the climate fight, and the lost opportunity to store carbon in forests should be factored into the carbon cost of cattle production.Myth 5: future tech will save usThanks to advances in technology, genetics and other factors, the US cattle industry feeds more people with fewer animals than it did decades ago. Mitloehner argues that this trend line is the only one that matters.“Foregoing meat once a week is not enough to make a significant difference in global warming. In fact, even if the world went 100% vegan tomorrow, that would fall short of making a sizable dent in greenhouse gas emissions. By a long shot,” he wrote in a 2021 blog post. “That isn’t to say we shouldn’t reduce animal agriculture’s climate contributions, but impactful solutions are likely going to come on the farm.”a graph plotting american beef consumptionThese on-farm solutions – from reducing cow burps with feed-additive seaweed to using bio-digesters for methane-polluting manure – are the focus of UC Davis’s new research and extension program under Mitloehner’s direction – the Clarity and Research for Environmental Awareness Center, or Clear Center, which has taken millions of dollars in funding from animal agriculture interests. But no solution can be as effective as reducing the overall number of cattle worldwide, a solution that Mitloehner and his industry allies tend to suggest is impractical or otherwise off-limits.“If cattle aren’t a problem, but seaweed is a solution to the problem, which is logically impossible,” said Matthew Hayek, an assistant professor at New York University who studies agriculture’s greenhouse gas emissions impacts, “then we’re blinded to the fact that just taking the meat off the table is technically the option that could accomplish the most mitigation.”The Cattlemen’s Beef Board and the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",2023-12-07
"Dancing, starry dwarf and narrow-mouthed: new species make India a frog paradise",Dozens of discoveries in recent years have shown the country to be a treasure trove of amphibians,"['The age of extinction is supported by', 'About this content', 'Kalpana Sunder', ' in Chennai']","It is barely the size of a thumbnail, so it may not come as a surprise that it took so long to spot the starry dwarf frog. It was discovered sitting next to some leaf litter by eagle-eyed researchers on a joint US-Indian expedition in thick shola forest in the Western Ghats in Kerala, south India, during a nocturnal hunt.The starry dwarf frog, or Astrobatrachus kurichiyana, named after a tribe in Wayanad, Kerala, where the frog was found in 2019, is just one of dozens of new species found in recent years that have revealed India to be a frog paradise.In the same year, a new species of narrow-mouthed frog, commonly called rice frogs, was found in an evergreen forest in a tiger reserve in Arunachal Pradesh, in India’s far east. The following year, three new horned frogs were found in the forests of north-east India.Astrobatrachus kurichiyana, the starry dwarf frog, was discovered in 2019 during a nocturnal expedition. Photograph: KP DineshIn the last 10 years, 14 new species of dancing frogs – tiny acrobatic frogs that attract their mates with unique kicks and seven new night frogs – some as small as a coin – have also been found in the Western Ghats.Amphibians have been around for millions of years and are the most threatened class of vertebrates. There are more than 6,759 species of amphibians worldwide, of which India has more than 440 species – up from 238 since the start of the new millennium.Although the amphibian population has been declining around the world – the IUCN Red List estimates that 41% of amphibians are threatened with extinction – in India many new species are being discovered. But many face extinction threats due to loss of habitat from the building of roads, human settlements and the felling of trees, as well as diseases such as fungus.Amphibians have porous and permeable skin and because they spend a portion of their life cycle in water and on land they are sensitive to environmental stressors and pollution. Frogs are important bioindicators and barometers of climate change, and even subtle changes in moisture or temperatures can have a drastic impact on their populations.Sathyabhama Das Biju, an amphibian biologist and wildlife conservationist at the University of Delhi, is called “India’s frogman”. He has worked since 1990, first in the Western Ghats and then in north-east India, discovering more than 100 new species of frogs, including the rare purple frog in Kerala, which remains underground all year, except for two to three weeks in the mating season.Sathyabhama Das Biju is considered the ‘frogman of India’, after discovering more than 100 new species. Photograph: SD BijuIn 2010, Biju launched the Lost Amphibians of India, a project collaborating with other institutions to rediscover species thought to have become extinct. “This citizen science project helps in rediscovering amphibians, with 17 groups of Indian citizens, from schoolchildren to engineers, working under scientists and has rediscovered as many as 29 species, some sighted after a century,” he says. “Frogs are everywhere and we have discovered new species even in roadside puddles near large towns,” he adds.“The frogs have an evolutionary history of 350m years and many species may look the same but are genetically distinct and therefore called cryptic species,” says Dr K P Dinesh, a scientist with the Zoological Survey of India ( ZSI), Pune.Dinesh has worked with amphibians, especially frogs, since 2000, and has discovered more than 50 species. “More than 90% of the frogs found in the Western Ghats are endemic to the region and cannot be found anywhere else in the world,” he says.The Western Ghats is one of 36 recognised biodiversity hotspots around the world and a Unesco world heritage site, with special microclimates, habitats and unique ecosystems and a high percentage of flora and fauna that can’t be found elsewhere. Rare species have been found here, such as the purple frog, which is believed to have coexisted with the dinosaurs, and was discovered only in 2003. Its closest relatives are in Seychelles in the Indian Ocean.“North-east India is another treasure trove of new species. This part of the country is relatively unexplored, unlike the Western Ghats, and many exciting discoveries in the future will be from here,” says Biju.Frogs are hard to study. Many are nocturnal and very challenging to sightKS Seshadri, evolutionary biologistKS Seshadri, an evolutionary biologist from the Indian Institute of Science, found three new species of narrow-mouthed frogs in 2016, near the coastal city of Mangalore. “It’s unfortunate that ancient laterite rock formations in India are classified as wastelands and mined for bricks, and not protected, because that was where we found new species of frogs,” he says. Seshadri has also done some pioneering work on measuring the effect of climate change on frogs, by recording their calls and correlating them with weather at different points in time.“Frogs are hard to study. Many frogs are nocturnal and very challenging to sight, as they live in fast-flowing streams and forest ground and come out only when it’s dark. Though it’s exciting to find new species, there’s a lot of hard research and months of lab work that is behind it. It’s hard to obtain research permits in forests to study them,” says Seshadri.A 13.6mm Vijayan’s night frog (Nyctibatrachus pulivijayani) sits on a fingernail. In recent years, scientists have discovered seven new species of miniature night frogs in India. Photograph: SD Biju/AFP/Getty ImagesBut as technology has advanced, more species have been discovered. “With new techniques like molecular genetics and DNA analysis, we are better equipped to classify cryptic species,” says Seshadri. “Also, researchers are probably just looking more carefully at species that were last described in British [rule] times.”NA Aravind Madhyastha, a biologist who works with the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and Environment (Atree), Bengalaru, says: “A better understanding of taxonomy coupled with using more morphological characters, as well as acoustic parameters like their calls, and molecular and DNA testing has led to a spate of rediscoveries and discovery of new species.”One of Madhyastha’s most fascinating finds was in a timber yard in Mangalore on India’s western coast – a narrow-mouthed frog called Microhyla kodial, whose closest relative is found only in Myanmar. “The research indicated that the frog could have been accidentally introduced with timber imported from Malaysia, Indonesia and Myanmar, he says.Biju is certain there are many more frog species to find in India. “Most of our country’s conservation efforts are aimed at the larger, more charismatic animals, and smaller creatures like frogs are not considered important enough for funding and research grants,” he says. “That has to change.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",2023-01-11
" This article is more than 5 months oldDitch green policies, win votes? Tories and Labour wrestle with net zeroThis article is more than 5 months old","Arguments between and within parties have been inflamed by the apparent ‘Ulez effect’ in the Uxbridge byelection

UK politics live – latest updates
","['Rowena Mason', ', ', 'Pippa Crerar', ' and ', 'Ben Quinn']","Since the Conservatives narrowly won a shock byelection victory by campaigning against a key low-emissions zone known as Ulez in London, there have been seven days of turmoil for climate policy in the UK.Support for a net zero UK by 2050 is expressed among all ages and types of political voter, according to the pollsters. But nevertheless, Rishi Sunak’s government scented in Uxbridge a possible “wedge” issue that could put Tories on the side of swing voters and pit them against Labour.Almost immediately, senior cabinet ministers began to flirt with the idea of watering down some climate policies that the public might regard as too costly to them personally in the short term.In the firing line? The ban on petrol and diesel cars by 2030, phasing out gas boilers by 2035, energy efficiency targets for landlords and low traffic measures.Tory insiders say Sunak is committed to renewables and decarbonising the energy sector but that he appears to be more sceptical of the car and boiler targets brought in by Boris Johnson, which they say the former prime minister brought forward without much thought for the consequences or feasibility.Alongside this, there is the temptation among senior Conservatives to cast Labour as going too far in support of green measures that will cost voters money, tapping into fears about the party’s stewardship of the economy that Keir Starmer and the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, have worked relentlessly to dispel.Grant Shapps, the energy secretary, has led the charge, accusing Labour of supporting a “criminal eco mob” of climate protesters, and recording a video slamming the party’s policy of no more oil and gas drilling in the North Sea.Ditching green policies may not be the vote winner Sunak expectsRead more“It is playing with fire; we undermine the political consensus on net zero at our peril,” says one Conservative MP who strongly supports tackling the climate emergency but was reluctant to stick his head above the parapet to say so publicly. “We also need to remember that voters are heavily in favour of our net zero targets.”Sebastian Payne, director of the centre-right Onward thinktank, who has warned that scrapping the net zero agenda could cost the Conservative party 1.3m votes, said the party had always had to strike a “balance between conservation and growth”.“We do believe very strongly that net zero and renewables are critical for the country and economy’s future and we shouldn’t resile from it,” he said. “On the politics, if you look at how many MPs are members of the Conservative Environment Network versus how many are on the Net Zero Scrutiny Group, I think that tells you where the centre of the party is on the environment.”Conservative MPs who back measures to tackle the climate emergency are far more numerous than sceptics, with more than 130 parliamentary members of the party’s environment network. Chris Skidmore, the leading Tory voice calling for more net zero support, said this week that abandoning climate policies would be “an abdication of responsible government”, and he is considering launching a Westminster “climate charter” to galvanise backing for its aims.Zac Goldsmith, the Tory peer and ally of Johnson who resigned with a devastating criticism of the government’s commitment to protecting the environment, also weighed in with a Guardian interview specifically singling out Michael Gove and Shapps for backsliding on their support for net zero.However, some of the net zero sceptics are noisier. A stream of rightwing Conservatives from Jacob Rees-Mogg to David Frost jumped on the first signs of a cracking in the political consensus to claim that it was more pragmatic and could win the party more support.Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader and cabinet minister, was one of those making the argument that the UK has set itself too stretching targets compared with other countries internationally, particularly on the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales.“We’re having to subsidise a switch to green technologies and the key point is how quickly we can do all of this because it feels to me like 2030 was just plucked out of the air. There’s no question that the British car industry will not make 2030 in a competitive shape on this if you demand that they drop petrol and diesel cars by then.”Right-leaning newspapers also jumped on the bandwagon with leaders calling for a delay to the nearer term targets. And by the end of the week, talk of a U-turn on climate policy had reached the New York Times, which ran a piece on the British Conservatives’ commitment to green issues being tested.Jill Rutter, a senior fellow at the Institute for Government, said Whitehall and business would be worrying about the mixed messages.“This isn’t the first time government has flip-flopped on climate policy. There has been an awful lot of on-off-ing particularly from the Treasury including when Rishi Sunak was chancellor – on carbon capture, and the green homes grant,” she said. “If you are someone working on this you would be looking at it with a degree of despair.”At first glance, it has looked this week as though the Tories’ splits on green issues could be mirrored in the Labour party. In the hours after last week’s Uxbridge byelection result, more than one ally of Keir Starmer was taking the shadow net zero secretary Ed Miliband’s name in vain.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We need to be careful that it doesn’t leave us open to Tory attacks or let it distract from our core messages.”Another added: “We need to talk about the economic challenge rather than net zero. That’s the public’s overwhelming priority”.Miliband, however, dismissed the noises in the wake of the byelection as “tittle tattle”, telling BBC Radio 4 that he was “far too experienced to be worried about that kind of thing”.He went on: “The truth is that Keir Starmer is absolutely 100% committed to the project of clean energy by 2030, which is the way to cut bills and give us energy security and tackle the climate crisis”.Senior Labour figures stress that for the past 18 months, Miliband has been talking about the green agenda through the prism of the cost of living crisis. “It is possible to do both,” they say.But others in the party have been spooked by Starmer immediately laying the blame for the failure to take Boris Johnson’s old seat on the London mayor’s Ulez policy.At Labour’s National Policy Forum (NPF) in Nottingham the following day, Starmer told his party: “We are doing something very wrong if policies put forward by the Labour party end up on each and every Tory leaflet.”His allies deny that his approach to Ulez should be interpreted as him backing off his climate commitments, suggesting the nuance was lost as “politics is a primary colours business”.Senior Labour figures insist that “nothing has changed” in the past week – despite appearances – and that Starmer and Reeves remain “firmly committed” to the green agenda.They point out that at the NPF the party formally signed off on bold commitments on clean power by 2030, setting up Great British Energy and not granting new oil and gas licences in the North Sea.“The real change on this has been in the Conservative party,” one said. “Shapps and Sunak are obviously desperate and have decided they want to have a bit of a culture war on these issues. I don’t think it’s going to work.”",2023-07-28
 This article is more than 9 months oldBiden administration sides with climate lawsuit against fossil fuel companiesThis article is more than 9 months old,DoJ brief argues Colorado case against energy giants ExxonMobil and Suncor should be heard in state court instead of federal,['Hilary Beaumont'],"The US Department of Justice filed a legal brief on Thursday in support of local governments in Colorado that are part of a growing wave of local and state governments pursuing climate litigation against fossil fuel companies.In the brief, the DoJ argued that the Colorado case against the Canadian energy giant Suncor should be heard in state court, which is considered more favourable than federal court for plaintiffs who are suing oil companies over climate change. ExxonMobile is also a defendant in the case.Experts say the DoJ brief is an action by the administration in support of climate litigation, fulfilling a campaign promise by President Joe Biden. “They’ve definitely come out on the side that the climate advocates wanted,” said Dan Farber, law professor at the University of California, Berkeley.State and local governments across the country have filed lawsuits in recent years alleging that energy giants, including Exxon, Chevron, Shell and BP, failed to warn the public about the harms of fossil fuels and engaged in deception or misrepresentation about their products, resulting in devastating climate emergencies in those jurisdictions. In court filings, fossil fuel companies have argued that media coverage of climate change extends back to the 1950s but local governments continued to promote and encourage production and use of oil and gas.Supporters of the wave of climate lawsuits have compared them to cases against big tobacco in the 1990s that resulted in settlements of more than $200bn against cigarette companies. If the lawsuits are successful, they could change how firms do business, compel companies to pay for climate adaptation, and reinforce banking industry concerns that fossil fuels are a risky investment.Since the first lawsuits were filed in California in 2017, oil companies have removed them to federal court, which they see as friendlier to their arguments. But the plaintiffs have maintained that the cases belong in state court.In 2018, local governments in Colorado sued fossil fuel companies seeking damages for the companies’ role in causing climate change. The local governments said they incurred heavy costs from worsening heatwaves, wildfires, droughts and floods, and that ExxonMobil Corporation and Suncor Energy Inc. According to the US Energy Information Administration, Colorado has abundant fossil fuel reserves, and two operating petroleum refineries located in Denver – one of them operated by Suncor.The lawsuit claims the companies “knowingly and substantially contributed to the climate crisis by producing, promoting and selling a substantial portion of the fossil fuels that are causing and exacerbating climate change, while concealing and misrepresenting the dangers associated with their intended use.”The case made it up to the 10th circuit appeals court, which agreed with the plaintiffs that the case should be heard in state court. The supreme court, now dominated by conservative judges, will weigh in on that issue.To aid in that decision, the supreme court invited the solicitor general, Elizabeth Prelogar, to file a brief expressing the views of the United States government on whether the case belongs in federal court. Prelogar had the option to support the state court argument by the Colorado counties, which she did in a filing on Thursday.Asked whether a Colorado case should be removed to federal court, Prelogar argued that the petition should be denied. “Respondents brought this suit in state court, alleging only state-law claims,” she wrote. “Under the well-pleaded complaint rule, respondents’ claims do not present a federal question, and petitioners have identified no sound basis for recharacterizing those claims.”The attorney for Suncor Energy did not immediately respond to request for comment.Farber said the brief was “laser-focused” on the question of whether the cases should be in federal court, and does not make any broader arguments about the climate litigation.The supreme court now has two options – it can either decline to hear the case, or it can take up the case. If it declines to hear the case, then the lower court decision stands, and the lawsuit goes back to state court – a win for the plaintiffs that would have a ripple effect on other climate litigation, and all the cases would be heard in state court, Farber said.If the supreme court decides to hear the case, oral arguments could happen in the fall and the court could issue a decision in 2024. In that scenario, all the climate cases before the courts would be on pause until the decision comes down, he said.“There could be some complicated issues about how to handle some of the individual cases, but I think basically the result would be that things would more or less stand still until the court either decides to hear this case or decides not to hear it,” Farber said.Richard Wiles, president for the Center for Climate Integrity, was delighted by the federal government’s brief. “We’re obviously very pleased with this decision,” he said over the phone. “The DoJ came down on the side of every other federal judge that has looked at this.” He said there is consensus in the courts and the legal community is that the cases belong in state court.As for the Biden administration, he said, “You can definitely say they made good on their promise to strategically support these cases.”",2023-03-17

Or if not me specifically, people like me. Middle-class consumers around the world who have shown marginal interest in curbing our lifestyles to address a warming planet.Even those of us with the best intentions remain a significant part of the problem.

After years of stalled climate action, it came as sweet relief to many when the Coalition was ousted in May, with six seats falling to community independents. The irony of the teals’ success is that it occurred in some of our highest emitting electorates, when you consider the consumption rather than production of carbon.Before the floods I thought climate change wasn’t my problem. Now, I’m not waiting for someone else to fix it | Ella BucklandRead moreIn 2017, for example, researchers from the University of NSW calculated the carbon footprints of residents in different Sydney suburbs. To do so, they estimated all the indirect, upstream emissions released to produce the goods and services consumed by residents in an area. Of the 20 worst-emitting suburbs, 12 of them fell in what are now teal seats. The worst of all were Potts Point and Woolloomolloo in the city’s eastern suburbs electorate of Wentworth, where the average resident was responsible for 28.3 tonnes of carbon emissions.To put this in context, the poorest 50% of the world’s population averages 1.4t per person per year. No one expects Sydneysiders to go back to living a third-world existence, of course. But the study showed the average Potts Point resident could reduce their footprint by 60% simply by living like someone 25km to the west in Auburn.Australia’s big emitters could cut CO2 by 90% by 2050 without offsets, report findsRead moreWhile this report was based on 2011 Australian Bureau of Statistics data, one of the authors, Prof Thomas Wiedmann from UNSW Sydney, told me recently those significant differences in emissions between postcodes would persist in 2023. “The main determinant on carbon footprint emissions is income,” he said.Rich people don’t emit more carbon because they’re morally inferior; they do it because they can. They have the means, and in our consumerist society, having the means means spending the means: on bigger homes, flights to Europe, more stuff generally. Scientists sometimes refer to it as “overconsumption” – something that does not contribute to needs satisfaction. And teal voters likely do more of it than average. Not just teal voters, either. It was the richest three electorates in Queensland that fell to the Greens in May.It’s interesting to ponder why wealthier electorates appear more likely to vote for climate action. Is it guilt? Is it fear? After all, those with accrued wealth and power have more to lose in a climate disaster, even if the poor are the ones on the front lines. It may also be that those in poorer electorates have more immediate concerns – like spiralling rents and food costs.Whatever the cause, the positive implication of the teal/Green paradox is that those with the biggest motivation to tackle climate change are the ones with the biggest ability to personally do something about it. But doing so requires rethinking our own role in addressing climate change.It continues to amaze me how little we talk about the demand side of the emissions equation. This is not the case for all emergencies. In times of drought, Australians are well versed at complying with water restrictions for the greater good. But we’re so used to hearing about global warming in a political context we now view it almost solely as a political problem. Such learned helplessness is insidious as it acts as a barrier to collective action. How would we have gone flattening the Covid curve without individuals taking part?skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rare is the politician brave enough to suggest the public modify their own consumption to address climate change. Media outlets who rely primarily on advertising are hardly incentivised to do so either. So it’s left to Greta Thunberg and a few others to advocate for doing more in our daily lives.Meanwhile, climate change forecasts continue to become increasingly grim. Emissions must fall by about half by 2030 to meet the internationally agreed target of 1.5C of heating, but they are still rising. This is only seven years away!How we vote matters; of course it does. But if you think politicians alone can get us out of this mess you’re either remarkably optimistic or haven’t been paying attention. We might like to deny it, but what we do matters.Overconsumption by the rich must be tackled, says acting UN biodiversity chiefRead moreThe fact is nearly half the world’s carbon emissions are caused by the world’s richest 10% of people, and nearly two-thirds of Australian adults fall inside that 10%, according to Credit Suisse (the cut off is to have a net worth of $204,000). Our desire to keep consuming – while not feeling bad about it – is how we end up with warehouses full of half a billion unrecycled plastic bags, multimillion-dollar carbon credit systems found to have resulted in fewer trees; and the continued spruiking of carbon capture and storage despite experts finding it is “not a climate solution”. Would it not be simpler to alter our lifestyles a little and buy less stuff?As the 2020 paper Scientists’ Warning on Affluence put it: “The affluent citizens of the world are responsible for most environmental impacts … any transition towards sustainability can only be effective if far-reaching lifestyle changes complement technological advancements.”Climate change may be most often portrayed as a political problem, but to me it’s primarily psychological. Letting go of aspirations and consumption habits built up over generations is extremely difficult. But how much longer can we pretend our lives needn’t change to reflect our grim climate reality? Yes, we must keep demanding better of our politicians on climate action. But it might also be time to look in the mirror and determine what part we should play in the solution.

What on earth were you doing in there? I thought, but dared not ask. She answered my raised eyebrows: “Chased after a suspect last night and dropped my purse. I can’t find it anywhere.” I had somewhere I needed to go and resolved to look myself later. Eleven years on, later is a long time coming.Back then, I was a “lookerer” (volunteer) at White’s meadow, an assistant watcher over a flock of Southdown sheep. The meadow bloomed that spring with celandine and lady’s smock, and the owner talked of managing for biodiversity. But persistent incursions by people and their free-roaming dogs drained his enthusiasm, and when two sheep were savaged he took his flock elsewhere.The meadow has become what is often disparagingly called rank grassland. Photograph: Sarah NiemannOver 11 summers since, the field has been left largely to itself, but for a hedge planted alongside the path. A grazed meadow has become what is often disparagingly called rank grassland. It’s true that the pink ladies and yellow stars disappeared a long time ago. And nettles, docks, thistles and brambles dominate over tussocky, matted grass that has knitted an impermeable blanket over much of the ground. But is it any better or worse for wildlife? I’ve never yet seen dog or human venture through the barrier of prickly, stinging, barbed vegetation. There may be otters or deer lying up here by day. Who would know?Marsh and meadow species compete for dominance on this flood plain that is becoming inundated more frequently, and wetland plants are using topography to establish a damp root-hold. The feathery tops of sweet reedgrass cut a diagonal slash along the course of an ancient river channel. And in the deep sumps at opposite ends, the wettest spots of the meadow, thickets of reedmace are burgeoning, the tubular dark brown seedheads exploding into raggedy fluff, like the loose wool between an old ram’s legs.A wren flits from stem to stem. Is it flighting over still-hidden treasure, a copper’s long-lost coppers?

Country diary: A tranquil scene that masks a dark contest,"Moreland’s Meadow, Belfast: The sex life of mallards is aggressive and highly unusual among birds, and has led to a remarkable evolutionary development",,"An eruption of quacks from a female mallard draws my gaze up the River Lagan. Two pairs. Further on, two single males. Familiarity can breed a dismissal of “Oh, it’s just a …” but the mallard drake is a splendid creature.My stare lands on a bottle-green head, its sunlit iridescence melding with the water’s reflected sheen to shimmer through his feathers. The primary-yellow bill. The thin white collar over his chocolate-coloured breast. The finely vermiculated porcelain-grey and taupe that sweep down to the rump, with its upturned kiss-curls and white wedge of tail. His mate’s plumage is an embroidery of browns, but she shares with him a bright blue flash on the wing’s secondary flight feathers, called the speculum.Country diary: a nocturnal predator cuts life shortRead moreThe reeds stir. Three more drakes emerge on to the open water. A loitering female swims quickly to catch up with her mate. Her caution is wise. This tranquil scene masks a dark contest. The sex ratio of mallard populations is skewed towards males, and surplus males gang up to bully females into what biologists coyly term “forced copulation”. It’s something that I still find disturbing. Female mallards usually resist, but can even end up drowning. Sticking close to one’s mate offers some protection until the ducklings hatch; whereupon their father decamps, perhaps to join a gang of marauding bachelors.Drakes succeed in mating with unwilling females partly because, as an evolutionarily ancient group, duck species have retained the avian penis, which is highly unusual among birds (for most species, sperm transfer relies on a cooperative genital “kiss”).But that’s not the whole story. Nature has contrived to provide female mallards with inbuilt contraception. The vagina has a spiral that counters unwelcome penetration by a male’s corkscrew-shaped penis (a spiral that apparently relaxes when a female solicits copulation). It also has dead-end “pouches” to receive unwanted sperm. An undesired male may win the battle, but he usually loses the war.So, while some mallard matings may be forced, only a tiny proportion of such matings successfully father ducklings. The female’s discerning choice prevails. And it’s that choice – what gladdens her eye and, over the generations, likewise gladdened her foremothers’ – which has evolved to this extravagant male beauty.

 ‘All we can do is ask’: how flood defences depend on private owners’ cooperation,"Environment Agency can do emergency work if life is at risk, but it’s hard to make landowners in England carry out repairs","['Helen Pidd', ' North of England editor']","James Mead was out running in January 2017 when he received a call from a colleague at the Environment Agency. A sinkhole had swallowed up two spaces in the car park at Sheffield’s Decathlon store and he needed to get there pronto.Mead, on call for the Environment Agency as a senior adviser, legged it down to the city centre to inspect the damage. “It happened overnight but just the previous day there would have been cars parked there. The worst-case scenario was very serious,” he said.Revealed: a third of England’s vital flood defences are in private handsRead moreThe sinkhole was caused by the collapse of a privately owned culvert, a tunnel carrying the Porter Brook, a small river that was concreted over in Sheffield’s industrial heyday. Mead said Decathlon had been warned it needed to repair the culvert before it caved in.In January Mead changed jobs and he is now the flood and water manager at Sheffield city council. It is his task to oversee the steel city’s flood defences, including the 36 in private hands that last year received the Environment Agency’s lowest “poor” or “very poor” ratings.One of those “very poor” defences was the Decathlon culvert, which has since been partially uncovered and shored up with a steel girder as a temporary fix. “It’s still not really up to scratch,” admitted Mead. His powers to force Decathlon to do the work are limited: “Really, all we can do is ask nicely and point out the risk and highlight the consequences.”Decathlon UK said it repaired the culvert “at considerable cost” after the 2017 sinkhole, before uncovering the river to encourage flora and fauna. Heavy storms in February 2020 caused the collapse of part of the culvert wall, which the company again paid to be repaired.“The culvert is now safe and we are continuing to monitor this situation,” said Decathlon’s regional property manager, Luke Fillingham. “We’re pleased to say that the river channel has never been blocked and is now in better condition than when we originally purchased the land in December 2010 thanks to the work we have undertaken.” Further repairs are planned in 2022.The Environment Agency has permissive powers that give it access rights to do emergency work if life is at risk, but ultimately it’s hard to make private landowners stump up for costly permanent improvements. “We don’t have, and neither do the Environment Agency have, the powers to make somebody actually fix something,” Mead said.Sheffield’s last major flood was in 2007 but there was a near miss in November 2019 when flooding caused havoc downstream in Doncaster and other parts of South Yorkshire. In 1991 a bad flood engulfed Sheffield station, an event commemorated today on platform 4 in the shape of a metre-long log with a plaque that says “debris washdown during the Sheffield station flood 21 December 1991”.Twenty years on, a flood defence under the station still puts the railway at risk after being given a “very poor” rating in 2019/2020. Most passengers have no idea that the station is built on top of the River Sheaf, which runs in three channels underneath the platforms.Douglas Johnson, a Green councillor who is now cabinet member for the environment, said it was a hangover from Victorian times when rivers were stinking sewers that should be covered up wherever possible. The thinking is now going in the opposite direction: this week Sheffield city council was given £20m from the government’s levelling up fund to uncover sections of the Sheaf as part of a regeneration project of the Castlegate quarter.Private ownership of these crucial public assets is not ideal, said Johnson. “It would obviously be far better to have things that were public assets owned by the public so that they can be managed in a coherent way.”",2021-11-01
 Non-fungible tokens aren’t a harmless digital fad – they’re a disaster for our planetAdam Greenfield,Artists are harnessing NFTs to sell their work but ignoring the vast amount of fossil fuels needed to power them ,,"If you happen to count yourself among those appalled by the seemingly unstoppable rise of NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, over the past few months, you might be forgiven a little schadenfreude at the recent news that a dispute has broken out over the ownership of Mars House, a digital file that sold in March for $512,000 (£360,000).Let’s be clear what’s been purchased here. Mars House itself is nothing more than a string of ones and zeroes residing on a server somewhere. But the NFT isn’t even that string. All it is is another such string pointing to that one, certifying that it is the only copy of that precise sequence of ones and zeroes in existence. Put aside, if you can, the obscenity of a purely virtual dwelling selling for half a million dollars. The dispute over Mars House makes plain what should have been obvious all along: NFTs aren’t even capable of guaranteeing the one thing their value is supposedly predicated on, ownership of a unique digital asset.NFTs are one of the signature fads of this deeply odd late-pandemic moment. At the centre of all the buzz surrounding them is something exceedingly curious: a digital token, generated using a cryptographic protocol of the same sort that underwrites currencies such as bitcoin, certifying the uniqueness of some image or other digital file. Again, what’s being bought and sold on the NFT market isn’t the artwork itself, just a kind of pointer to it, with the buyer’s name inscribed upon it.An artwork need have no other merit – neither historical resonance nor social relevance nor aesthetic refinement nor even skill in execution – to be valued in this way. You can’t do anything with Mars House, other than own it. What is valuable about the string of digits that makes up the token is that you as purchaser are the sole possessor of it. And, as the recent legal contretemps makes clear, even that most basic assertion rests on shifting sands. All of which makes Mars House, like all NFTs, an infinite zero, and a perfect representation of the meaningless churn so much of our economy is based on.In part, this is because NFTs, as the ultimate in artificial scarcity, solve a non-problem, an issue nobody actually had. The NFT frenzy marks the convergence of the art world and the disturbingly Ponzi-like dynamics of cryptocurrency trading, where enthusiasts speak openly of their contempt for “bagholders”, the last suckers to have bought in big before the market finally comes to its senses; the whole thing stinks of tulips. This is evidently no problem for an art market that long ago gave up the pretence that artworks might hold a critical mirror up to the rest of society, or are anything other than a particular, specialised asset class.But ultimately, this isn’t why it’s so depressing to see artists rushing to prop up the NFT market. The real problem has to do with a presently inescapable feature of the way NFTs work. Each transaction on the Ethereum blockchain, on which most NFTs are currently recorded, involves a set of calculations called proof-of-work. Those calculations are intentionally designed to be energy-intensive. The furious churn of all the processors involved in validating proof-of-work globally burns vertiginous amounts of electricity, at significant environmental cost. The New York Times recently quoted a French artist taken aback to learn that their “release of six crypto-artworks consumed in 10 seconds more electricity than [their] entire studio over the past two years.” Similarly, Elon Musk’s recent large-scale transactions in proof-of-work-based Bitcoin released more carbon into the atmosphere in just a few days than the amount saved, in principle, by all the Teslas ever sold.Artists peddling their work as NFTs may or may not care about this brutal calculus. But it makes particular nonsense of art that claims to spur the viewer to some kind of ecological consciousness. Consider, for example, John Gerrard’s recent announcement of an NFT for his video piece Western Flag – according to Gerrard an artwork that, in “flying the flag of our own self-destruction”, asks us “to consider our role in the warming of the planet and simultaneous desertification of once fertile lands”. By choosing to release a Western Flag NFT, though, it’s as if Gerrard and his gallerists have scrawled this statement across the land in letters of crude oil a mile from tip to tip, and then set them on fire … a thousand times over.The promoters of Gerrard’s NFT promised that its environmental impact would be carefully offset, the sale rendered carbon-negative by investment in something called regenerate.farm, “a cryptofund for climate and soil”. But this is more than a little fatuous. Even assuming that all the claims regarding offsets prove to be true, Gerrard’s announcement created buzz, credibility and, crucially, validation – and therefore underwrote the market for other NFTs, the overwhelming majority of which were not offset or buffered, either by regenerate.farm or in any other way. Indulging in this kind of sophistry feels like reckless disregard for the planet, and depraved indifference to the damage being caused.Some 12 years after bitcoin’s launch, and six after Ethereum’s debut as a blockchain that could be programmed in a way that permits NFTs to be issued, the technology’s many promised and radical innovations have yet to arrive. All that has actually come to pass is a transfer of power from the institutions of global finance to even sketchier and less accountable actors, while the rest of us are saddled with an environmental impact nobody can afford to bear. One can’t help but wonder if the proud new owner of Western Flag will think it was all worth it on some day, not so very far from now, when the coastal cities have drowned, the brackish water that comes from the tap needs to be boiled before it is safe to drink and climate refugees huddle in tent cities stretching to the horizon.

" Vanuatu, one of the most climate-vulnerable countries, launches ambitious climate plan",The Pacific country has committed to 100% renewable energy in electricity generation by 2030,"['Supported by', 'About this content', 'Lagipoiva Cherelle Jackson']","The Pacific country of Vanuatu has launched one of the world’s most ambitious climate policies, committing to 100% renewable energy in electricity generation by 2030 and ambitious targets on loss and damage.The announcement signals yet another instance of the small island state making its mark in international climate efforts.At last year’s UN climate summit in Glasgow, all countries were urged to “revisit and strengthen” their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) on climate action by the end of 2022. Vanuatu is one of just 12 countries to have done so, and its ambitious targets have been praised by regional experts.From Vanuatu law school to the Hague: the fight to recognise climate harm in international lawRead more“They are really setting an example for the rest of the world,” said Tagaloa Cooper-Halo, the director of the climate change resilience program at the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP).“Vanuatu is leading by example in many ways, despite having negligible emissions. They are taking the lead by putting up their plan. This was a monumental effort by their government and all the stakeholders because it takes a lot of work and coordination to arrive at that announcement.”Vanuatu is already a carbon-negative country – meaning it absorbs more emissions than it produces – but has committed to going further, by phasing out fossil fuels almost entirely and hoping to become 100% renewable in its electricity generation by 2030.They are also pushing for a loss-and-damage finance facility to be rapidly established in order to support vulnerable communities.According to the government, the costs of achieving Vanuatu’s revised commitments, are estimated at $1.2bn by 2030.“Thirty years ago, Vanuatu was the first nation in the world to call for climate polluters to pay for the permanent losses and irreversible damage caused by their emissions,” said Dr Wesley Morgan, a senior researcher at the climate council.“Today, Vanuatu is calling for the establishment of a new loss-and-damage finance facility at the UN. To be an effective ally to the Pacific on climate action, Australia should support a new loss-and-damage finance facility.”The move also sets the tone for the Pacific’s preparation for the COP27 summit to be held in Cairo in November.Vanuatu, which is rated the country most at risk of natural disasters by the UN, is also currently pushing for the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to hand down an advisory opinion on climate-related harm.“The Vanuatu government has been very bold in pursuing the ICJ opinion, and this is all good for the Pacific,” said Cooper-Halo.According to the Vanuatu government, more than 80 states from around the world are supporting their pursuit for an advisory opinion from the ICJ ahead of a vote at the UN General Assembly at its forthcoming session.",2022-08-14
" Global deforestation pledge will be missed without urgent action, say researchers",Destruction of forests slowed in 2021 but not enough to meet 2030 commitment made by 145 countries,"['Damian Carrington', ' Environment editor', '@dpcarrington']","The destruction of global forests slowed in 2021 but the vital climate goal of ending deforestation by 2030 will still be missed without urgent action, according to an assessment.The area razed in 2021 fell by 6.3% after progress in some countries, notably Indonesia. But almost 7m hectares were lost and the destruction of the most carbon- and biodiversity-rich tropical rainforests fell by only 3%. The CO2 emissions resulting from the lost trees were equivalent to the emissions of the entire European Union plus Japan.Global heating could not be limited to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels without ending deforestation, experts said. At the UN’s Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow last year, 145 countries pledged to end the felling of forests by the end of the decade. The demolition and degradation of forests causes about 10% of global carbon emissions.However, based on current trends, the Glasgow leaders’ declaration would be as “hollow” as the pledge made by countries in 2014 to end deforestation by 2020, the assessment’s authors said.There was little clarity or transparency of the measures being taken to end deforestation and only 1% of the required funding was being provided, they said, and most importantly a lack of political will.Erin Matson at Climate Focus, a policy group and one of the coalition of organisations that conducted the assessment, said: “The [Glasgow declaration] was a big moment, the first time such a target had been embraced at the leaders level by so many countries, covering 90% of global forests.“But we are not on track. There has been some modest improvement, but even this could just be temporary. Many countries are putting their progress at risk by phasing out or rolling back protections. For example, Indonesia did not renew its palm oil moratorium after it expired in September 2021 and a recently adopted law on job creation poses a serious threat to natural forests.”Deforestation graphicThe largest area of destroyed forest in 2021 was in Brazil, where deforestation has risen under president Jair Bolsonaro, having fallen under his predecessor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The election contest between the two men, on 30 October, has been described by scientists as likely to determine the fate of the Amazon. “The stakes are high,” Matson said.David Gibbs, a research associate at the World Resources Institute’s (WRI) Global Forest Watch, said: “We are quickly moving toward another round of hollow commitments and vanished forests.”Fran Price, at the World Wildlife Fund, said: “There is no pathway to meeting the 1.5C target or reversing biodiversity loss without halting deforestation and conversion. It is time for bold leadership and daring solutions.”Four of the top five countries with the largest areas of deforestation – Brazil, Bolivia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Paraguay – increased the destruction in 2021.However, “exceptional progress” in some countries showed the 2030 goal was still possible, the authors said. Indonesia, the only country to cut deforestation in each of the past five years, and its neighbour Malaysia, reduced forest destruction by about 25% in 2021. As a result, tropical Asia is the only region on track for zero deforestation by 2030.A drive to end the razing of forests for cocoa plantations in Ivory Coast and Ghana helped deforestation fall by 47% and 13% respectively, while new national parks and measures to fight illegal logging led to a 28% fall in Gabon. Tropical Latin America, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia and Guatemala also reported cuts in deforestation in 2021.“We have the data and we know what interventions work – the missing element is the political will to actually undertake those actions,” said Frances Seymour at WRI.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

To get to zero deforestation by 2030 requires a fall of 10% a year, meaning the current slowing of deforestation is insufficient.Forest cover has increased in some countries since 2000 but less than the area lost. New forests could not offset the huge carbon storage and biodiversity of existing natural forests, the authors said.Protecting intact forests had even more climate benefits than just the CO2 stored, said Seymour, thanks to their role in producing cloud cover that cools the planet. “If we take the non-carbon processes into account, they amplify the cooling effect of ending tropical forest loss by about 50%,” she said.Michael Wolosin, at Conservation International, said: “That 50% cooling bonus should be included by forest countries in their accounting to gain the recognition and finance they deserve for the services their forests are providing to the world.”",2022-10-24
 NSW plastic straw ban: how will it work and what will be gained from it?,"Single-use plastic straws, cutlery and cotton buds will be among items banned from Tuesday

Sign up for our free morning and afternoon email newsletters from Guardian Australia for your daily news roundup
","['Tamsin Rose', '@tamsinroses']","Single-use plastic straws and other items will be banned in New South Wales on Tuesday. The decision follows similar action to ban single-use plastic bags earlier this year.We take a look at what this means for customers and businesses, and how it will be enforced.What is being banned?From 1 November, single-use plastic straws, cotton buds, stirrers, cutlery and some food containers are banned. This will also cover biodegradable, compostable and bioplastic products but will not extend to wooden implements.There will be some exemptions to the rule, including allowing people with disabilities or medical needs to use plastic straws.Serving utensils such as salad servers and tongs will also be exempt, as well as plastic items on packaging – including straws on the side of juice boxes and plastic film lids on containers.NSW and WA in ‘race to the top’ to ban single-use plastics from next yearRead moreExpanded polystyrene containers, like those used for halal snack packs and fish and chips, are also set to be banned. Other items including meat and produce trays will not be included in the ban.In the bathroom, microbeads in some personal care products, such as those used in exfoliants and masks, will be banned, alongside single-use plastic cotton buds.What other measures are in place?Earlier this year lightweight plastic bags – that are less than 35 microns in thickness at any part – were outlawed. This includes biodegradable, compostable and bioplastic bags.The ban does not apply to bin liners, dog-poo bags, and the thin bags for fresh produce and deli items in supermarkets. Bags used for medical items are also exempt.At the time the NSW environment minister, James Griffin, said single-use bags are convenient but their impact is undeniable, so they need to go.“Single-use plastic is used by many of us for just a few convenient minutes, but it remains in our environment for many years, eventually breaking into microplastics,” he says.“Single-use plastic items and packaging make up for 60% of all litter in NSW.”

What’s wrong with biodegradable, compostable and bioplastic alternatives?The government decided to include these alternative materials – widely seen as eco-alternatives to conventional plastic – because they often do not biodegrade unless they are treated in an industrial composting facility.They argue this will create a problem if they were not banned at the same time, despite the gradual rollout of food and organic waste (FOGO) bins across the state.How will the ban be enforced?Businesses and distributors caught giving out banned plastics can face on-the-spot fines of up to $13,750 and, if pursued in court, can be fined as much as $275,000.Work has also been done with the National Retailers Association (NRA) to get retailers and businesses across the details ahead of the two-stage ban implementation. They can also call a free hotline that has been set up by the NRA for advice on how to transition away from plastics.How much plastic waste will be saved?The government estimates that 2.7bn items will be stopped from entering landfills and the environment over the next 20 years as a result of the ban.The move is part of a state government push to reduce plastic litter by 30% by 2025 as part of a wider $356m five-year plan that included the rollout of green FOGO bins by 2030.What are other states doing?South Australia was the first Australian state to ban single-use plastic bags, with an exemption for biodegradable bags, back in 2009. It then strengthened its stance with further bans on single-use straws and other items last year.The ACT implemented its own ban in 2011 before Tasmania followed in 2015. Queensland then imposed its own ban in 2018 before Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Victoria in 2019.Major retailers have also moved on this, with Woolworths and Coles almost simultaneously bringing in bans on single-use plastic bags in 2018.Quick GuideHow to get the latest news from Guardian AustraliaShow Email: sign up for our daily morning and afternoon email newslettersApp: download our free app and never miss the biggest storiesSocial: follow us on YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook or TwitterPodcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite appPhotograph: Tim Robberts/Stone RFWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Griffin said NSW was making sure it got it right and had been developing a robust and thorough suite of policies, including the container deposit scheme.“We’ve worked long and hard on the NSW plastics plan,” he said earlier this year.“You’ve got to look at plastic in the entire waste stream, so how it’s produced, how it’s distributed and how it’s recycled.”",

"Country diary: Tick-tock, it’s tick o’clock","Porlock, Somerset: Beware these tiny blood-sucking arachnids – they are thriving in the countryside and urban parks after the wet spring",['Sara Hudston'],"English wildlife has very few dangers. Adders – our only venomous snake – are scarce, shy and non-deadly to humans. European hornets (Vespa crabro) look and sound intimidating, but are rarely aggressive. Even the plentiful moon jellyfish (Aurelia aurita) that sometimes swarm beaches and harbours cannot sting.Yet I am wary of one creature, especially in summer. Usually less than 1cm long, it is typically found in areas of rough grazing, woodland or moorland where there are rabbits and wild deer.Exmoor provides a perfect habitat, and it is especially abundant here. In recent days, I have found many crawling through my dog’s fur, or hanging like dark, berried drops around her nose and eyes. These are ticks: blood-sucking arachnids that feed on mammals, including people.I have never known ticks to be so numerous as they have been in the last few weeks. It’s not just my perception; scientists at Bristol University are getting reports of a sudden rise in numbers. They think that this year’s cool, wet spring delayed tick emergence, and then the warm May caused a sudden flush of vegetation, providing ideal conditions for their survival.Country diary: A cloud of male flies drifts by, while the females bask below | Claire StaresRead moreAfter a walk in Horner Woods, I find seven on my dog’s head, picked up while she was nosing herbage along the side of the path. These are castor bean ticks (Ixodes ricinus), bay-coloured with chestnut-brown, seed-shaped bodies and black legs. Hedgehog ticks (Ixodes hexagonus), the species found most often on cats, seem to be less common. Measuring no more than 4mm when unfed, the fully engorged hexagonus females can bloat into greyish-white blood-swollen bladders of up to 1.3cm long. Ticks find hosts by climbing plant stems and waiting, forelegs outstretched, sensing heat and movement. When an animal brushes past, the tick hooks on, seeking a spot to bury its hypostome, the barbed tube that anchors it in place and through which it sucks.As with other parasitic lifeforms, feeding can transmit bacteria into the host’s circulation. Some ticks carry Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria, which cause Lyme disease, a debilitating illness requiring treatment with antibiotics. And it’s not only a countryside issue – the castor bean tick can be found in city parks across the UK. Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary",2023-06-01
" ‘Desperate’ UK councils hiring out more parks to festivals, warns expert",Surge in festivals after Covid lull risks making green spaces elitist as councils try to offset tightened budgets,['Miranda Bryant'],"Cash-strapped councils are increasingly hiring out their green spaces to festivals, an expert has warned, blocking them off from residents for weeks at a time, damaging grass and causing congestion.Councils were “more desperate than ever” to attract commercial income to supplement their reduced budgets after a pandemic hiatus, risking making public parks “more exclusive and more elitist” in the process.Community groups have raised concerns about lack of access for local people during the recent unprecedented heatwave and the school holidays.Andrew Smith, professor of urban experiences at the University of Westminster, said there now seemed to be more festivals in some parts of the country than before the pandemic.A big factor driving this, he said, was that festival organisers were trying to make up for the financial shortfalls of 2020 and 2021, while local authorities needed to generate commercial income amid tightening budgets.“Festivals are back and back in earnest, and some of the issues associated with them are back as well,” he said. “Lots of people complaining, lots of people worried about restricted access to their parks over the summer months.”According to a Local Government Association (LGA) report, parks suffered a “devastating loss of income” due to the pandemic, with some forecast to lose as much as £8.8m in 2020/21.On Tuesday, the Guardian reported that local authorities in England were spending nearly £330m less a year in real terms on parks and open spaces than they were a decade ago, with the most deprived areas experiencing the deepest cuts.While the picture varies nationally, the issue is especially prevalent in London, said Smith. Other affected cities include Newcastle, Bristol and Nottingham.Some park friends organisations, such as the Friends of Finsbury Park in north London, which hosted Wireless festival in July, have called for large events to be stopped entirely. In east London, Victoria Park Friends have written to Tower Hamlets council requesting that All Points East, which started last Friday, be held outside the school summer holidays.According to analysis of the festival market by the Association of Independent Festivals, of the 194 festivals with a capacity of 5,000 or more people, about 10% are in metropolitan areas, either in parks or city-based venues.Paul Reed, the association’s CEO, said: “My sense this year is that there is slightly more activity in parks than pre-Covid, with promoters launching new shows, expanding existing ones and adding extra days.“Covid was financially devastating for our sector. Over half of UK festivals have not been operational since 2019 and this is the first full season since the pandemic.”Festivals continue to face extremely challenging trading conditions this summer, he said, amid supply chain and staffing shortages, cost increases of 25% to 35% and the impact of the cost of living crisis on audiences.Despite increases in some areas, others have seen cancellations. In Newcastle, This Is Tomorrow festival cancelled this year’s event in Exhibition Park, citing “an oversaturated market and an ongoing economic crisis”.While rates vary, it is understood that councils can earn as much as £500,000 for a weekend festival for 50,000 people, and that some charge a day rate of £250,000.Some of the big London parks are understood to earn more than £1m a year from hosting festivals.Some parks, Smith said, are now entirely self-financed through festivals, which while “good in many ways … comes with lots of downsides” by effectively turning them into event venues.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He called for greater transparency over how much councils charge and where the money goes.Councillor Gerald Vernon-Jackson, chair of the LGA’s culture, tourism and sport board, said: “Any income earned from a council-run event is reinvested into other public services, such as the council arts budget, and events bring other benefits such as improving mental health and boosting pride of place.“Balancing the immediate needs of residents, including condition of parks as a result of the droughts, alongside the wider benefits to communities from having these events, is something that councils consider carefully.”Tower Hamlets council said All Points East, which runs from 19-28 August, was permitted under its major events policy and approved by its cabinet, which allows up to 10 events a year in Victoria Park, and that festival organisers were required to submit their dates in advance each year.A spokesperson said: “The council’s major events programme brings much needed income to support the upkeep of our parks and council services and provides a range of benefits. AEG Presents provide four free-to-access community event days, In the Neighbourhood, which include a number of local artists, cultural and community groups for families to enjoy.”Haringey council said events at Finsbury Park bring “world-class music and entertainment” for Haringey residents and visitors, unite communities after Covid, help fund park improvements and benefit local businesses.“We will always take on board the views of our residents and there are a number of issues to consider around these events including how we get people in and out of the area, how we work with the joint boroughs and respect the local area,” said councillor Julie Davies, cabinet member for communities and civic life.A Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities spokesperson said: “Councils are responsible for granting permission and they must consider the impact on the local community and environment when doing so.“The government fully recognises the importance of parks and that is why we recently launched the £9m Levelling Up Parks Fund which will create over 100 new and improved parks in urban areas, increasing access to green space for those who need it most.”",2022-08-25
Country diary: A swift hunting among house martins is a joy to savour ,"Back Dale, Derbyshire: Detached from the wider southward migration of its kind, the lone bird is like a wolf among dogs",['Mark Cocker'],"The sky was intermittently blue and weak sunshine sparked a faint chorus of grasshoppers. Otherwise, this was a landscape wrung dry of all summer and the grasses were grey, the thistles dead, if flossed with cottony seed. The only sounds were the long-drawn notes of young buzzards that were suffused with a sense of melancholy.There were seven birds – adults and immatures – careering at one another in mock squabbles, or they would flap away with deep rhythmic wingbeats, before coming about and paddling up on the bluffs of warm air. Perhaps it was the way that their movements perturbed these rising currents, but 50 house martins and swallows circulated among them to feed, like children perhaps, playing but oblivious around the slower limbs of walking adults. It was a glorious, slow-twisting gyre of different flight modes.Then I spotted the swift. It must have been a lone Scottish breeder or a Scandinavian migrant drifted to these islands. Yet it was alone and plainly detached from the wider southward movement of its kind, much of which occurred in late July.House martin flight is beautiful and quick, and the separate strokes not easily countable, but in swifts you barely register wingbeats at all, each one swerving into the blur of the last. If an absence of straight lines defines nature, then swift flight is nature’s apotheosis. My bird jinked left and right, again and again, repeating the twists maybe seven to eight times, as if there were invisible obstacles aloft and the bird must plot a tight route through all that free air.I had to recall that with each bend of its path, some insect was also being snaffled by the bird’s immense maw. A parent can take prey like this, one after the other, until an invertebrate ball, adhering as a bolus in its sublingual pouch, can number 1,000 items. Swift flight, then, is both precise and practical, but also purer than in any other bird and watching it feed here among martins was like seeing a wolf hunt among dogs. It was a joy to savour it one last time until next spring. Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary",2022-09-20
Sir Stephen Lovegrove to chair Rolls-Royce-led nuclear consortium ,New role for former permanent secretary in energy department raises concerns over ‘revolving door’ between public and private,['Henry Dyer'],"A former national security adviser Sir Stephen Lovegrove is to join the Rolls-Royce-led consortium developing small nuclear reactors as chair of its board, raising concerns about the revolving door between the public and private sectors.The role, which has been approved by the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), will begin in the new year. Lovegrove’s background as a permanent secretary, the most senior civil servant, in the energy department from 2013-2016 are likely to prove valuable to the consortium.Lovegrove will be paid for his part-time role at Rolls-Royce SMR, a consortium that includes the Qatar Investment Authority as a partner. Rolls-Royce SMR is developing small modular reactor technology in part funded by the UK government. The relationship is managed through Great British Nuclear (GBN), an arm’s-length body of the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ).GBN’s non-executive directors include Hugo Robson, a senior civil servant who is the chief commercial negotiator for DESNZ. Robson has previously worked under Lovegrove in the energy department and in 2017 they gave evidence to a Commons select committee together.GBN is running a competition with six companies vying for lucrative contracts to build the small modular reactors the government hopes will expand nuclear power in the UK. Billions of pounds of public and private investment await the companies that successfully develop small modular reactors.Lovegrove will begin his work for Rolls-Royce SMR in 2024 when GBN hopes to announce contracts by the summer. His role as chair will include managing stakeholder and shareholder relations.Acoba has given Lovegrove, who served as permanent secretary in a predecessor department to DESNZ from 2013 to 2016, permission to “draw on his skills and experience gained in office to advise the Rolls-Royce SMR Board on its strategy and proposals. That includes those related to government funding […] provided he does not draw on any privileged information or contacts from his time in office”.Along with the other members of the company’s board, Lovegrove will review, scrutinise and approve proposals by Rolls-Royce SMR’s executive on the “deployment of its small modular reactors with proposed customers – including GBN”.The Guardian has discovered, however, that while Lovegrove and Rolls-Royce SMR told Acoba he has had “no prior contact or engagement with the individuals within GBN”, he has known and worked with DESNZ’s chief commercial negotiator for a number of years.Lovegrove signed a letter in 2015 formalising Robson’s appointment to a senior role on the Hinkley Point C nuclear power project, noting Robson was a member of the department’s senior leadership team.In 2017, Robson and Lovegrove, by then the permanent secretary at the MoD, gave evidence to the public accounts committee in the same hearing on Hinkley Point C. At times, Lovegrove suggested Robson may be better placed to answer the committee’s questions.Now, Lovegrove is in a position to advise Rolls-Royce SMR as it prepares to negotiate with GBN, with years of experience as a senior manager to Robson, a non-executive director of GBN, which has given him a vantage point to understand his negotiation strategies, thinking and character, if Robson has a role in the negotiations.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They said the GBN competition had “robust conflict of interest policies”.Rolls-Royce SMR told Acoba that Lovegrove will not be involved in developing bids or contributing to the negotiation process run by GBN.A spokesperson for Rolls-Royce SMR said Lovegrove has had no dealings with, contact or engagement, with the individuals at GBN in relation to their roles there. Lovegrove did not comment.An Acoba spokesperson said: “Acoba does not consider that engagement with individuals during his time at DECC seven years ago and who are now with GBN would be material to this application.”Rose Whiffen, a senior research officer at Transparency International UK, said: “Unfortunately, there are threadbare rules in place to regulate the so-called revolving door but at the very least, former officials should be able to abide by these, including full transparency about their time in government.”",

All four denied the charges.Lancaster, a teacher, was also found to be in contempt of court after she spoke to the jury about the climate crisis despite being warned not to do so by the judge, Silas Reid.All four chose to represent themselves during their trial at Inner London crown court.In her closing address, Mecoli said: “I know that there were some very angry drivers.

If I could, I would apologise in person to those caught up in the disruption.”‘We’ll be hated, but it will stir things up’: Insulate Britain on what happened next – and being right all along Read moreHowever, she added: “The prosecution did not bring to court any members of the public supposedly so affected by the protest. The action wasn’t selfish. We planned the action carefully.”Lancaster said she felt she had acted with “care”, and that if she could face drivers disrupted by their protest, she would apologise to each for the delays they faced.In comments that led the judge to send jurors out of the court, she added: “I do not apologise for the actions I took. I feel I acted with care when our politicians do not care, letting thousands die each winter from the cold, failing to reduce carbon emissions that are destroying our world, and using our legal system to criminalise and gag those who raise the alarm.”After the jurors returned to court, Reid told them: “She [Lancaster] knew she wasn’t entitled to say what she said at the end of her address.“She wants the trial to deal with her concerns with respect to climate change. That is not what this trial is about.“You must ignore what she said with respect to the government and climate change.

He then said to the jury: “We carried out the act for the people caught up in it, for their children and grandchildren, and for your children and grandchildren.”Reid declined to discharge the jury after Till’s words, but asked them to disregard elements of Till’s closing address.All four will be sentenced on 30 June.",2023-04-04
"Country diary: the lapwings are back, but without a warm welcome","Abernethy, Strathspey: Six pairs have returned to this bog to nest, although their stay here is far from secure",['Amanda Thomson'],"Recently I have been watching six teuchits – peewits, lapwings – at the bog close to where I stay. They returned in late March and early April to nest; in fact, “teuchit storm” is an old Scots phrase that describes the inclement weather around that time.First there were three, then three pairs. They flap up and tumble and wheel in blacks and whites. Up close the iridescence of their feathers quivers in the sunshine. All the while they beep and “chae-widdlewip”, sometimes so close that I can hear the whoop-whoop of wind through their feathers. An old bird guide from the late 1970s tells me they’re one of the 60 most common resident species, but now the British Trust for Ornithology tells me their conservation status in the UK is red.I’m delighted to see them back. The other day I counted three up in the air, and when I scanned the bog, I saw two more, thinking the sixth was hidden somewhere behind a clump of reeds. The calls of some greylags distracted me, then ravens seemingly flew out of the sun from the east.I crossed the fence heading home and, just beyond, came upon a mass of feathers: primaries, secondaries, “semiplumes”, and downy white wisps that even as I watched were caught and agitated by a fleeting breeze. Some feathers were half white and half black, tipped with white. Others were a smoky brown-black, some again tipped with white, others fading to a buff-coloured oval towards their tips. Smaller ones, greenish, bluish, purplish, shimmered as I held them in my palm. Yet more were a sandy brown, and when I look closely at a photograph of a lapwing, I see these ones would have been from its lower back, just before its white rump and black tail with its tiniest edge of white.Just like that, one of a pair gone.Two more ravens prukked, and I watched them dip down into the pinewood to the north. Even though they were half a mile away, I could hear a noisy stramash between them and something else, before they flew back up and continued on their way.

AnalysisWeather tracker: looking back as summer ends in northern hemisphereJames Parrish (MetDesk),"The season was a mixed bag in Britain, but Japan has had its hottest summer on record",,"Entering September brings the arrival of meteorological autumn in the northern hemisphere, officially drawing the summer of 2023 to a close.In the UK, the summer was a mixed bag. We started with a fairly pleasant June before entering into a wet and windy July caused by multiple consecutive weekend low pressure synoptic situations. A relatively unusual August followed in which we had two named storms, Antoni and Betty, before a pleasant warm spell.Meanwhile, Japan has been under the influence of a heatwave over the previous few months, leading to the country breaking records for both the hottest month and the hottest summer since records began in 1898.After Japan recorded its hottest mean July temperature, with an average temperature anomaly of +1.91C, the country then went on to break the record for the hottest mean August temperature with a mean temperature anomaly of +2.16C. As a result, August 2023 was the hottest month in Japanese meteorological records. The month was so warm that air temperatures in Tokyo were observed to be peaking above 30C (86F) every day of the month, with the lowest daily maximum being recorded at 31.8C on 9 August.This meant the summer of 2023 was the hottest summer recorded in Japan in the past 125 years. The mean temperature for the season, which is based on observations recorded across 15 locations around the country, reached 1.76C above the seasonal average and beat the previous record from 2010 by 0.68C.Last Friday, Hong Kong raised a rare typhoon signal 10 storm warning in preparation for Typhoon Saola, which arrived that night. Maximum sustained winds of 121mph (195km/h) were recorded from Saola while it was about 20 miles (30km) away from Hong Kong. The typhoon died down in its passing but not without causing about 460 flights to be cancelled.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

AnalysisWeather tracker: Storm Ciarán and Louisiana superfog cause chaosJames Parrish and Matt Andrews (Metdesk),"The Channel Islands bore the brunt of a record-breaking storm, while a crash in the US involved 168 vehicles",,"In the past couple of days, Storm Ciarán created quite a ruckus across southern parts of England, but caused more significant disruption to the Channel Islands.As Ciarán arrived on Wednesday night, the Channel Islands received the brunt of the storm with wind gusts in excess of 100mph observed at Jersey airport. There were reports that a suspected tornado developed across Jersey during the early hours of the night, accompanied by hailstones the size of golf balls. Serious damage was inflicted on properties, with windows being blown in, roofs torn off houses and debris damaging cars.There were no reports of UK casualties, which, unfortunately, cannot be said for other parts of western Europe. According to the UK Met Office, Ciarán was a record-breaking storm with the lowest mean sea level pressure (MSLP) in November for England and Wales. The MSLP is the pressure of the atmosphere adjusted to the height of the mean sea level. An MSLP of 953.3 hPa was recorded in Plymouth, while 958.5 hPa was observed in St Athan, beating the previous records of 959.7 hPa (1916) and 962.7 hPa (2010) for England and Wales respectively.Meanwhile, dense “superfog” in Louisiana in the US caused several serious car crashes on Monday 23 October, with one multi-car pileup on the interstate 55 highway to the north-west of New Orleans killing eight people. More than 20 people were taken to hospital, with 168 vehicles involved in the fatal collision. A tanker carrying hazardous liquid was caught up in the crash, and many vehicles caught fire.The crash occurred when fog combined with smoke from nearby marsh fires, reducing visibility to as low as 3 metres (10ft). Superfog is a common phenomenon and occurs when smoke and moisture from burning organic material mixes with moist cool air. The smoke particles attach to the water molecules creating dense fog, which causes hazardously low visibility.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

 There are good reasons for a double shampoo – if you can avoid waste,"An Italian town has banned the practice during a heatwave, but if done right it benefits hair and scalp","['Sali Hughes', '@salihughes']","Global consumption of water is growing twice as fast as the world’s population and droughts are affecting swathes of the planet. So it was no surprise that this week the mayor of an Italian town in Emilia-Romagna, which is experiencing a severe heatwave, banned hairdressers from shampooing their customers’ hair twice, saying it would save thousands of litres of water a day.As we all attempt to reduce waste, that additional shampoo at home or in the salon can seem like overkill. So is what is known in the trade as “double cleansing” really necessary? No, but every hairdresser and trichologist is seemingly in agreement that the second shampoo has distinct benefits to scalp and hair, regardless of skin and hair type.Is this the end of shampoo? New ways to clean your hairRead moreThe celebrity hairdresser George Northwood says double cleansing hair will usually mean it stays cleaner for longer. The first shampoo can be cursory, he says, and “removes superficial styling products and external dirt [it’s worth noting that our bodies – which we tend to wash only once in the shower – are generally not clogged up with products] and will typically yield little lather”. Think of it as removing your clothes before taking a bath. The second shampoo will then clean more thoroughly.This is certainly true in my experience (yes, double cleanser, here). The hairdresser Adam Reed agrees that two shampoos will always give greater results but he saves on water by applying the first shampoo to dry hair. “It’s actually the best way to get rid of styling products, sweat and grease,” he says. “Then, when I’m rinsing off that, I’m getting the hair wet, ready for the basin shampoo, as I would anyway.”Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BSTThe amount of water used varies wildly according to where the washing is taking place, of course. In a home shower, the falling water is incidental as we simultaneously wash the rest of our bodies, so a second shampoo may not automatically mean more water. But at the salon basin, two shampoos does mean roughly twice the time and water.The hair salon brand L’Oréal has partnered with the Swiss tech startup Gjosa to develop a water-saving system via a low-flow showerhead, which breaks up the flow of water while accelerating the pressure and speed of the droplets. Prototypes are already in use in South Africa and the US, and the company says it will yield a water saving of 70% in salon washes.Hopefully two shampoos may soon cost the salon and the planet less than the price of one.",2022-07-02

 Climate 200: man behind teal MPs warns Labor not to hobble independents with electoral spending cap,"Byron Fay says he supports government plan if it doesn’t benefit major parties while hindering political newcomers

","['Paul Karp', '@Paul_Karp']","The head of fundraising group Climate 200 has endorsed a cap on electoral spending proposed by Labor, but warned it must not be set at a level that helps incumbents and disadvantages new political players.Byron Fay, the executive director of Climate 200, made the comments on Wednesday in response to the special minister of state, Don Farrell, revealing the government would aim to legislate a cap as part of reforms, including truth in political advertising and improving adherence to the one-vote one-value principle.In an address to the National Press Club in Canberra, Fay also outlined that the fundraising body would not go into “hibernation” after its success getting six independent MPs and one senator elected in May, and might target state seats in Victoria and New South Wales.Labor aims to legislate spending caps and truth in advertising, says Don FarrellRead moreClimate 200 helped raise $13m from 11,200 donors, supporting a slew of successful candidates in the former Liberal-held seats of Wentworth, North Sydney, Mackellar, Goldstein, Kooyong and Curtin; and David Pocock’s Senate campaign in the Australian Capital Territory.On Sunday, Farrell told Guardian Australia that Labor would seek to legislate spending caps after an inquiry into the 2022 election. Labor was concerned about the tens of millions in electoral spending racked up by the United Australia Party at the past two elections.Asked his view on the proposed reform, Fay said the spending cap needed to be considered “in the context of a root-and-branch review of all the incumbency benefits the major parties have given themselves”.Those included “pork-barrelling” aimed at winning votes and $750,000 every three years for MPs’ office expenses, including electoral communications, which Fay said were “often used for campaigning”.Fay said he was “very open-minded to the idea of caps” but it had to be legislated to “make sure we are not disadvantaging future community groups that want to put up community leaders”.“We should think very carefully about any reform in that space so it doesn’t entrench the advantages the major parties have given themselves.”Fay ruled out providing support to independents, after the Albanese government cut their staffing allocation from eight staff each to five.“Not a single independent MP we supported has asked us for support to help them deal with their staffing and is not our mandate.”New infrastructure minister says some Coalition projects will be scrappedRead moreUnlike after the 2019 election, Climate 200 would not go into hibernation but would be guided by donors and supporters about how it engage in future campaigns, he said.The model was “demand driven” and Climate 200 might be willing to help state candidates if “people get mobilised and start to speak to their friends and colleagues get and start to have a different type of community leadership”, he said.“There is some momentum building in Victoria but it is a long way away from being the type of campaign we will be supporting at this time.”Fay said the “stranglehold” of the two major parties had been “shattered” at the 2022 election, which had shown “well-organised communities with the right support can take on the party machines and win against former and would-be future prime ministers”.“The result was a launchpad for the community independence movement, not a landing zone. Now, the real work begins.”Fay warned that Australia was still “miles away” from a science-based response to global heating, as the Coalition’s targets were consistent with three degrees of heating and Labor’s two degrees.Asked how parliamentarians should respond to Labor’s take-it or leave-it approach to its proposed 43% emissions cut by 2030, Fay noted that target “enshrined in our nationally determined contribution is that it is a step in the right direction” and that voters “want to see parliamentary action”.“We would see that as a stepping stone to greater ambitions and in terms of what the now elected [MPs] and senators want to do, that is entirely up to them.”On Wednesday the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said that while his minor party in the Senate balance of power was “willing to negotiate on climate … it seems Labor isn’t”.“This ‘my way or the highway’ approach from Labor is setting Australia up for a very long three years. The government should choose cooperation over confrontation.”Bandt warned that Labor’s weak climate targets would be “blown” if it proceeded with new gas projects such as the Northern Territory’s Beetaloo Basin, which he said would lift greenhouse pollution by up to 13%.",2022-07-13
 Backers of UK airport expansion are part of UN green investment scheme,Thirteen investors including Universities Superannuation Scheme accused of hypocrisy,"['Miranda Bryant', ' and Rich Collett-White']","Investors funding bids to expand UK airports have been accused of hypocrisy after it emerged they are signatories to a UN green investment scheme.Members of the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) scheme, who number more than 4,000, publicly commit to acting in “the best long-term interests of our beneficiaries”, including incorporating environmental issues into their investment analysis and decision-making.But analysis by the environmental investigation group DeSmog has found that 13 signatories to the scheme are also investors in UK airports with expansion plans, including Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Bristol.Campaigners say UK airport expansion plans must be suspended amid new climate goalsRead moreThe investigation found that at least one investor in each of the seven airports seeking to expand is involved in the scheme, including four out of five of Bristol airport’s shareholders and four out of Heathrow’s seven.The Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), the main pension provider for the British higher education sector, is a Heathrow investor at the same time as being part of PRI’s “Leaders’ Group”, which celebrates “responsible investment excellence”.Sam Pickard, a climate and sustainability researcher at the Overseas Development Institute thinktank, said: “This analysis shows – yet again – the gulf between the finance sector’s actions and its rhetoric. Investments that unlock decades of future carbon emissions in rich countries are the complete opposite of what is required for creating shared prosperity in the face of the climate emergency.”Charlie Kronick, a senior climate campaigner for Greenpeace, said the findings raised “really serious questions” for initiatives such as PRI. “We know airport expansion, particularly in Europe and the UK is totally incompatible with any kind of serious climate ambition.”He added: “Basically, every week there’s a new investor alliance or coalition that says their climate credentials are amazing and they’re still ploughing money into the same old high-carbon activity from airports to coal.”He said it was “essential” that groups such as PRI “re-evaluate their membership criteria”. Otherwise, he warned, “they risk being nothing more than a smokescreen or a meaningless badge for investors to hide behind”.The UK government recently concluded a consultation on how to achieve a net zero aviation sector by 2050. The Climate Change Committee, an independent body advising the government, has recommended that no net increase in airport expansion should be allowed unless the industry “sufficiently outperforms” its current emissions trajectory, following previous warnings that the sector could consume as much as two-thirds of the country’s 1.5C carbon budget if left unchecked.The PRI, which was started in 2006 under the then UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, describes itself as the “world’s leading proponent of responsible investment” and its chief executive recently called for a “sustainable and inclusive recovery from Covid-19”.But it has been criticised for not setting strict enough membership criteria. Last year, for the first time, five investors were removed for failing to meet minimum requirements.The scheme does not have a defined policy on aviation investment but last year released a statement with Climate Action 100+, another green investment initiative, in which it defined expectations for the sector, including setting 2050 net zero emissions targets and strategies to support the development of sustainable aviation fuels.Fiona Reynolds, the chief executive of PRI, told the Guardian it was “committed to driving investor action to help achieve the goals of the Paris agreement to reach a net zero carbon emissions economy by 2050 or sooner”. Reaching that goal, she said, “requires near-term action and innovation across all sectors”, including aviation.But, she added: “The PRI is not responsible for – nor can it monitor – every individual investment in its more than 4,300 signatories’ portfolios. They must be monitored by the investor, in line with their own investment beliefs, investor duties, commitments and policies.”Reynolds said it was “continuing to strengthen our minimum requirements” and the investment reporting systems.Karen Dee, the chief executive of the Airport Operators Association, said UK airports were “at the forefront” of global aviation decarbonisation efforts. “They were driving forces behind UK aviation’s commitment to net zero by 2050 – a world first for a national aviation sector – alongside a clear roadmap towards achieving that target.

 Indigenous rangers to use SpaceCows program to protect sacred sites and rock art from feral herds,"New space technology will allow traditional owners to predict where cattle and buffalo are going and cull them or fence off important sites

",['Tory Shepherd'],"Feral herds rubbing off rock art, trampling sacred ceremonial sites and destroying culturally significant waterways will be tackled with new space technology.Balnggarrawarra ranger and Cape York’s Normanby Station traditional owner Vince Harrigan said existing technology allowed rangers to track feral cattle and buffalo through the Top End, but the new SpaceCows program would let them predict in advance where they’re going and cull them or fence off important sites.CSIRO estimates there are more than 120,000 introduced buffalo and hundreds of thousands of cattle that have spread out from cattle stations.Feral livestock driving decline in native mammal numbers across the Northern TerritoryRead moreArtificial intelligence and data from satellite tracking of tagged animals will be used to create a replica virtual landscape. That will predict, for example, how hot weather might push herds to head a certain way towards water and allow rangers to intervene.Harrigan said SpaceCows – a joint project between Aboriginal land management groups, universities, CSIRO, satellite company Kineis, and Microsoft – would indicate where the herds were, and where they were going, to help protect traditional lands. Rangers would be trained to use the AI, drones and tablets to manage the animals across more than 22,000sq km.Rangers could then decide whether certain areas needed to be fenced off, or other actions (such as culling) undertaken.Harrigan said sacred sites where laws were discussed and ceremonies held could be trampled by herds, who could also gather in sheltered spots with ancient rock art.“We’ve got areas we call bora grounds where we do initiations. (They’re) like meeting places, you know, where our mob gather and our dancers and songwriters can perform,” he said.“Some of our rock art they’re down really low, in sheltered areas. There have been cases where there have been cattle right next to these low paintings, rubbing up against them. Over time they’re brushing it off, rubbing it off.”The comparison between damaged and non-damaged land can be clearly seenCSIRO started tracking feral hoofed herds in real time last year, from Arnhem Land to Cape York. With SpaceCows, Microsoft’s Azure AI technology will be used to create a digital twin landscape using the data from the satellites as well as information about the weather and the terrain.The CSIRO research scientist Dr Andrew Hoskins said the biggest challenge for feral animal management was finding the animals in a vast and sometimes inaccessible terrain.“Microsoft’s technologies harness data from tagged animals and Low Earth Orbit satellites, enabling us to see the landscape and forecast the movement of feral herds,” he said.CSIRO researchers Dr Andrew Hoskins and Rodolfo Ocampo survey data.

 This article is more than 10 months oldNew York zoo ends attempt to recapture Flaco the owl in Central Park This article is more than 10 months old,"Officials say they will keep close eye on Eurasian eagle-owl, who has been successful at hunting the city’s plentiful supply of rats",['Associated Press in New York'],"For two weeks, an owl that escaped the Central Park Zoo has eluded capture as legions of fans worry about its ability to survive in New York City.Fecal bacteria ‘rampant’ on New York sidewalks, researchers findRead moreWould Flaco, a majestic Eurasian eagle-owl, go hungry because he had not developed an ability to hunt while in captivity? The answer was a resounding no: Flaco is feeding on park rats.Zoo officials said they were suspending recovery operations but would keep a close eye on the owl.“We are going to continue monitoring Flaco and his activities and to be prepared to resume recovery efforts if he shows any sign of difficulty or distress,” officials said.The bird’s name in Spanish means “skinny”. In the early days of his escape he was not seen eating. But when he started coughing up fur and bones, it was proof he had been hunting.Officials acknowledged that recovering Flaco was difficult, especially “since he has been very successful at hunting and consuming the abundant prey in the park”.The Eurasian eagle-owl is one of the larger species, with a wingspan of up to 2m, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society. They have large talons and distinctive ear tufts.Zoo officials tried to lure Flaco with bait and recordings of eagle-owl calls. He showed interest but didn’t fall for the ruse.The search was launched on 2 February after the discovery vandals had cut the bird’s enclosure. Flaco has not strayed far from the park. He flew to Fifth Avenue, where police tried to catch him, and visited the park skating rink.“Flaco has been doing well,” said David Barrett, who runs the Twitter accounts Manhattan Bird Alert, Brooklyn Bird Alert and Bronx Bird Alert.“That’s amazing. He’s made a remarkable move from being a captive owl to being in the wild much faster than anyone would have expected. He’s catching prey on his own. He continues to fly better and better. He seems to be enjoying himself out there.”Flaco was less than a year old when he came to the Central Park Zoo in 2010. Owls are mostly solitary and usually only interact with another animal during breeding season.“Is he going to be lonely out there?” said Barrett. “That’s a good question.”",2023-02-19
AnalysisHasty changes to Sunak’s climate strategy reveal a warring Tory partyFiona Harvey Environment editor,Major omissions and a last-minute refocus on energy security rather than net zero suggest a prime minister buffeted by internal factions,,"Rishi Sunak, the UK prime minister, headed to Oxfordshire on Thursday to visit a development facility for nuclear fusion, the early-stage concept that promises unlimited clean energy at an unspecified future point, if only some hefty physical constraints can be overcome.He was accompanied by Grant Shapps, energy and net zero secretary, for the biggest energy and climate change announcement of his premiership, a comprehensive package of measures encompassing everything from onshore wind and solar power to carbon taxes and heat pumps.“When global energy supplies are disrupted and weaponised by the likes of Putin, we have seen household bills soar and economic growth slow around the world,” said Sunak, of the “powering up Britain” energy package. “We have stepped in to shield people from its worst impacts by helping to pay around half the typical energy bill. But we are also stepping up to power Britain and ensure our energy security in the long term, with more affordable, clean energy from Britain, so we can drive down energy prices and grow our economy.”Yet, only a few days before, the plan was to hold the launch in Aberdeen, the oil and gas capital of the UK. Local businesses had been primed, oil and gas specialists were ready, shoving their minor interests in green alternatives – such as hydrogen – hastily to the fore, for an event to be hailed as “energy security day”. Fossil fuels would be a necessary part of that energy security, they had been assured.And, only a few days before that, the plan was not to foreground energy security at all – the event was to be called “green day”, and the focus would be clearly on renewable energy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and tackling the climate crisis, as well as bringing down household bills through supporting clean power.Tom Burke, co-founder of the thinktank E3G, and a veteran government adviser, said the whirl of changes in the run-up to the launch were both bewildering and revealing. “This is a level of chaos that reveals the extent of the internal unresolved disputes within the party on these issues,” he said. “There is an anti-green faction in the Tory party, and this chaos has been all about them.”The energy strategy, running to well over a thousand pages across its reams of documents, covers everything from nuclear fusion – which some experts regard as an unconvincing distraction, when technology to cut emissions today should be the priority – to electric vehicle charging points.Sunak had little choice but to publish some form of strategy this week, as last year the high court ruled that the government’s existing strategy to meet its legally binding target of net zero emissions by 2050 was inadequate. The judge in the case, brought by Friends of the Earth and other campaigners, ordered a revamp by the end of this month, also the deadline for the government to publish its response to the review of net zero by Tory MP Chris Skidmore, published in January.To complete the package, the chancellor of the exchequer, Jeremy Hunt, decided to publish his strategy for green investment at the same time, setting out how the private sector is expected to fund the comprehensive overhaul of the UK’s economy needed to reach the net zero target.For the government, this marks a major cross-Whitehall operation, encompassing policy that spans the Department for Transport, Department for Levelling Up, Department for Business and Trade, and Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, as well as the Treasury and the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, and Downing Street.The government’s focus is timely, given rapidly growing concerns that the UK is falling behind internationally, which have been given new urgency by the war in Ukraine and the soaring price of energy. The US is pushing forward strongly with its $369bn Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to make America a superpower for clean energy technologies and offers tax breaks to manufacturers.Europe, after initial outrage that it was losing its green leadership status, is now hard at work on its response. Hundreds of billions of euros of investment are at stake, and the sacred cow of state aid rules is likely to be slaughtered in pursuing them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For most of the experts and campaigners delivering their verdict on Thursday, the answer was a clear no.The UK’s ‘green day’ has turned into a fossil fuel bonanza – dirty money powers the Sunak government | George MonbiotRead moreMel Evans, head of climate at Greenpeace UK, summed it up: “Ministers talk about leading the world, but the UK is not even making it to the starting blocks of the green tech race. A good government would go all in on renewable, efficient energy to give millions of people warm homes, clean air, lower bills and a safe climate – but powering Up Britain is a far cry from what this country needs.”Despite the support for offshore wind, the talk of electric vehicles and the focus on carbon capture, there were too many misses. Plans to insulate 300,000 homes were dismissed as puny, compared with the 14m that need upgrades. Onshore wind turbines are still, in effect, banned, despite small changes to the planning rules. Hydrogen is still being touted for home heating, despite studies showing it will not work. Solar panels will not be mandated on new-build housing, and the heat pump scheme is still flawed.Burke laid the blame at the door of a prime minister besieged by a warring party. “This feels like a party that is internally divided, that can’t come up with a coherent story, that can’t even agree what the story is,” he told the Guardian. “And this is what is spooking investors: this anti-green faction of losers who are going to turn the UK into a loser, in the global race for green prosperity.”",2023-03-30

Saddler grew up watching his father, Bruce, an engineer, help design and build the South Australian electricity grid. He went on to graduate from the University of Adelaide and gain a prize-winning PhD in plant physiology at Cambridge University.With a rising interest in politics, society and the environment, he worked in London on transport and industrial development policy before returning to Australia in 1974 to work as a research fellow at the University of Sydney, and then on to the Ranger uranium environmental inquiry. He later moved to the Australian National University, where he eventually became an adjunct professor at the ANU Crawford school of public policy.Saddler’s work on climate change policy began in 1988, when he led a business that provided energy efficiency advisory services to residential and business clients in Canberra. This work included specialist services for low-income households in financial hardship.In 2006, Saddler developed a methodology for tracking Australia’s energy emissions with a lag of only a few weeks. This work evolved into a regular update on energy emissions, published first by pitt&sherry, then the Australia Institute, and most recently by ANU as the Australian Energy Emissions Monitor. Saddler’s research contributed to the Australian Energy Market Operator’s integrated system plan – a global benchmark planning tool for energy systems attempting the transition to 100% renewables.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He helped design the ACT scheme that fulfilled its world-leading 100% renewable electricity goal by 2019. It came in ahead of schedule and at low cost. Saddler deserves credit for ACT electricity prices falling in real terms this year while retail bills in states that still rely on coal and gas for electricity rose by between 20% and 27%.A prolific writer, Saddler was the author of the book Energy in Australia: Politics and Economics and countless chapters, scientific papers, monographs and articles on energy, technology and environmental policy. He was a frequent commentator on electricity market and climate policy affairs in the national media and online publications. He owned and managed a series of energy and policy consulting firms from the early 1980s until this year.In addition to his own work, Saddler played a central role in the creation and governance of many of Australia’s leading climate policy organisations. In 1994, he became a founding board member of the Australia Institute and was a founding director of the Climate Institute from 2005 until its closure in 2017. He later played a critical role in helping the legacy of the Climate Institute continue at the Australia Institute’s climate and energy program. He was part of the Grattan Institute’s energy reference group from 2011.Our future as an electrostate: Alan Finkel on how Australia gets to net zero from here Read moreSaddler loved the outdoors and was a keen bushwalker and competitive rogainer. He was heavily involved in the campaign to save Tasmania’s Lake Pedder, ran for the Senate for the Labor party in 1984, loved poetry and classical music and was a keen jam maker and amateur botanist.Saddler will be remembered for his public-spirited research, his successful outreach and his influential advice to governments. He was a dear friend and colleague to many, and a mentor and teacher of countless young minds.Saddler was married to Marilyn Chalkley for almost 50 years. They have two sons, Owen and Harry.

ExplainerA guide to the UK energy security strategy,Amid a cost-of-living crisis the government is attempting to secure energy supplies and try to dampen soaring costs,"['Fiona Harvey', ' Environment correspondent']","What is the energy security strategy?Soaring energy prices are helping to create a cost-of-living crisis, with the average family’s energy bill rising by 54%. The energy price cap has been raised to £1,971 and a further increase is expected later this year, which would take the average household bill to about £2,300. The government has responded by offering a one-off £200 discount on bills from October, to be paid back over five years.The UK is not alone: energy prices are rising around the world as industries struck by Covid-19 lockdowns resume operations, and energy supplies still need to ramp up after plunging two years ago during the first lockdowns. The war in Ukraine is adding to the problem: Vladimir Putin has used his dominance over EU energy supplies (Russia supplies 40% of Europe’s gas, and 60% of Germany’s) as a weapon of war, and turned down the gas taps by a quarter before the invasion.Putin could tighten supplies still further, and in any case the EU wants to move away from Russian fossil fuels to stem the flow of money to the Kremlin war machine – Europe has paid more than €15bn (£12.6bn) for Russian gas, oil and coal since the invasion began.The UK relies less on Russian fuel, which makes up only 3% of UK gas supplies and about 8% of oil, but British consumers will be hit anyway as the price of gas is set by international markets that are badly affected by the war.Now the government is publishing a strategy to secure the UK’s energy supplies and try to dampen soaring costs for consumers and industry.What will be in it?Renewable energy will play a significant role, with the government planning to rapidly increase the goal for offshore wind generation, and relax the planning rules that have prevented onshore windfarms being built in England for most of the last decade.Nuclear power will get a boost, with the government seeking to help investors expand the UK’s reactor fleet. Keeping the UK’s existing nuclear power stations open as long as possible will help provide stability through the current crisis and beyond, but any new reactors are likely to take more than a decade to start producing power.Fossil fuels will also be a big focus for the strategy, with the government seeking to expand the UK’s supplies of gas and oil, pumping more from the North Sea and making overtures to big Middle Eastern suppliers such as Saudi Arabia. New licences for the North Sea, already under way, will be brought forward.What about fracking?The government is leaving the door open to fracking, saying that it could be allowed if health and safety conditions are met, but few in Whitehall see any real future for fracking in the UK. Fracking at scale would require the industrialisation of swathes of the UK’s landscape, would face huge local opposition, would be expensive and would take years to produce any gas. It is not a solution to the current crisis and the carbon dioxide emissions it would generate make it unsuitable for any future crisis.Could we go back to coal?Coal, the dirtiest form of electricity generation, is to be phased out in the UK by 2024. But the government is understood to have made informal contacts to the UK’s remaining coal operators – EDF, Uniper and Drax, which has converted its boilers to biomass but could feasibly return to coal – as a contingency.Whitehall sources claim this is only a question of sensibly keeping options open in case of deepening crisis, rather than overtures to a coal renaissance.What will not be in the strategy?A windfall tax on fossil fuel companies. Such a tax would have serious backing – the International Energy Agency, regarded as the gold standard on energy policy advice and not known for its radicalism, has advocated a windfall tax in the EU, with the proceeds to be used to ease energy bills for vulnerable people. Labour and the Liberal Democrats have also called for one in the UK.Unfreezing the fuel duty escalator would raise billions that could be recycled to the poorest. Petrol taxes have been kept steady since 2010, resulting in an £11bn loss to the Treasury in 2019, and fuel-guzzling SUVs now make up about half of new cars bought.Making public transport free would be a radical move to get people out of cars overnight, and slash petrol and diesel demand while leading to clearer skies, less air pollution and safer roads for walking and cycling.And a nationwide push to insulate every home to decent standards, and install heat pumps in place of gas boilers, would slash the UK’s energy bills and end the need to import fossil fuels from this year if pursued at speed.But these measures have been ruled out by the Treasury and other departments.What is happening to fossil fuel companies?Party time. They are enjoying a bonanza, with BP’s chief boasting his company was a “cash machine”, and his finance chief that he has “more money than we know what to do with”. Dangerously for the Earth’s climate, they are using this to cement their lobbying power, telling governments they should invest in expanding oil, gas and even coal.But an increasing number of political leaders are seeing the war in Ukraine as a sign that clean, domestically produced renewable energy can bolster national security.What will all of this do to net zero?The government is expected to reaffirm its commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, despite agitation from a small number of rightwing Tory backbenchers and Nigel Farage. Boris Johnson is said to be a personal champion of green issues within the cabinet, and Michael Gove, the secretary for levelling up, spoke out strongly in favour of net zero this week.Are energy prices the only factor behind the cost-of-living crisis?No, the prices of food, clothing and other goods are also rising. Inflation is affecting many countries as economies recover from the Covid-19 recession, and the war in Ukraine has added to pressures, particularly over food as Ukraine and Russia are leading grain and oil exporters. But another factor unique to the UK that is raising prices is Brexit, as imports and exports now face extra costs, paperwork, staff shortages and other barriers. But don’t expect this government to admit that.",2022-03-19
AnalysisWeather tracker: extreme heat to spread across southern US and MexicoAlice Fowle (Metdesk),Record temperatures will continue to put stress on power grids with blackouts reported in some areas,,"Extreme and prolonged heat looks set to continue across the southern states of the US and Mexico through this week. This heatwave, which has already brought record temperatures across Texas through the past two weeks, will extend into states such as Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri and Louisiana over the coming days.At least 50 million people have been placed under extreme heat advisories as temperatures are forecast to soar at least 5-10C above the climatological average, with daily maximum temperatures reaching 40-45C (104-113F). San Angelo airport in Texas has already recorded two consecutive days where the temperature hit 45.6C (114F), which surpasses its highest ever temperature by three degrees.This heat will continue to put stress on power grids across the southern states and Mexico. Texas in particular is uniquely vulnerable to power failures as it is the only state in the contiguous US that is disconnected from the national grid. As a result, the power grid operator for Texas has asked residents to voluntarily cut back on electricity due to anticipated record demand.In Mexico, demands on energy have already surpassed last year by 9% due to the heat. Blackouts have been reported in Cancún and Tulum, leaving many without air conditioning and fresh water. Several heat-related deaths have been reported by local media.Across Australia, a long band of rain will stretch more than 3,000km (1,800 miles) from the north-west through to the central region and into the south-east – including the outback. It is expected to bring anywhere between 10 and 100mm of rainfall across the entire region through this week. For the outback, this will easily surpass the winter climatological average for rainfall in just a few days.An area that is particularly at risk is around Alice Springs and Yulara, across southern and western parts of the Northern Territory, where the highest rainfall totals are expected of 50-100mm. This region of the Northern Territory is classed as a semi-arid or arid environment and on average receives only 250-300mm of rain every year. Alice Springs usually gets only 10.3mm of rainfall in June. As a result, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology has issued a flood watch warning through the entire week across four states.",2023-06-26

At 3%, mammals are the group least associated with soils.“Here, we show that soil is likely home to 59% of life including everything from microbes to mammals, making it the singular most biodiverse habitat on Earth,” researchers write in the paper, which is a review of existing literature. The actual figure could be even higher as soils are so understudied, they say.Before this study, scientists did not know what the most species-rich habitat was, says the lead researcher, Dr Mark Anthony, an ecologist at the Swiss Federal Research Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research. “In my research circle, many suspected it should be soil but there was no evidence.”He added: “Organisms in soil play an outweighed impact on the balance of our planet. Their biodiversity matters because soil life affects climate change feedbacks, global food security, and even human health.”Soil is the top layer of the Earth’s crust and is composed of a mixture of water, gases, minerals and organic matter. It is where 95% of the planet’s food is grown yet it has historically been left out of wider debates about nature protections because we know so little about it. One teaspoon of healthy soil can contain up to a billion bacteria and more than 1km of fungi.Researchers used the rough estimate of there being about 100bn species in total. They then used theoretical estimates and data analysis to work out what fraction of those species were found in the soil. They defined a species as living in the soil if it lived within it, on it, or completed part of its lifecycle in it. Other habitats they looked at include marine, freshwater, the ocean floor, air, the built environment and host organisms such as humans.There is a large error range of 15% with the estimate – so the average prediction could in theory be as low as 44% or as high as 74%. For some groups the range was large – for bacteria, estimates ranged between 22% and 89% living in the soil.Anthony said: “What actually surprised me the most was the sheer challenge of this undertaking, and how much variation there is to our estimates for many large groups, particularly bacteria and viruses, the two most diverse forms of life on Earth.“Keeping that in mind, our estimate is really a first attempt to organise existing global richness albeit with quite a large error to many of the estimates. While true diversity lies somewhere within this range, our effort is the first realistic estimate of global diversity in soil, and we need it to advocate for soil life in the face of the biodiversity and climate crises.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Pollution, deforestation and global heating also damages soil. Adopting less intensive agricultural practices, greater regulation of non-native invasive species, and increasing habitat conservation will all help increase soil biodiversity, researchers say. Practices such as soil transplantations could also restore microscopic lifeforms in soil.Dr Roy Neilson, an ecologist from the James Hutton Institute in Dundee, who was not involved in the research, said: “It is extraordinarily difficult to enumerate soil biodiversity … The approach taken in this study arguably generates the current best estimate of global soil biodiversity.“However, as the authors note, generating these estimates has been challenging and they are transparent as to the level of robustness of their data, which in turn highlights areas for future scientific investigation,” said Neilson, who is an author on the British Ecological Society’s upcoming report on regenerative agriculture.",2023-08-08

","['Supported by', 'About this content', 'Tom Plevey']","Whitehaven Coal has been granted a licence by the Perrottet government to explore a new site which could lead to the expansion of its Narrabri underground coal operations in north-west New South Wales.The Gorman North strategic release is one of eight sites listed as “potential areas for proactive release for coal exploration under the strategic release framework” (SRF) by former deputy premier John Barilaro.The licence, granted on Friday 9 September under the operational allocation framework (OAF) process, allows Whitehaven to seek out sites for a mine extension closer to Narrabri, under the edges of the Pilliga state conservation area.Anti-coal action group Lock The Gate has condemned the move and released a Gorman North strategic release mapping and analysis report.Lock The Gate in a statement said that its analysis revealed threats to groundwater, endangered species, and native forest if Whitehaven built coal mines in the area.Climate groups blast minister’s support of new Australian gas projects as ‘fact-free spin’Read moreThe licensing has caused confusion among landholders in the exploration zone, who cited a lack of community consultation, and licences being issued without a competitive tender process.But because the approval was under the OAF, Whitehaven was not required to undertake community consultation or conduct a preliminary regional issues assessment (PRIA).Landholders believed because Gorman North was a strategic release, any licences would be issued under the SRF, requiring public consultation.NSW Greens MP Sue Higginson questioned the use of the OAF instead of the SRF to approve the licences, labelling them “socially reckless and irresponsible”.“If there is some sort of ambiguity about which pathway to take, then surely you would take the pathway that the spirit and intent of the system provides and what the community expects,” Higginson said. “But clearly they didn’t.”Higginson questioned the Mining, Exploration and Geoscience (MEG) chief executive, Georgina Beattie, about this in late August.“What I understood from the response,” Higginson said, “is because there were no other potential market operators out there, it went straight in under [the OAF]”.“Whitehaven coal has been the one company that has not been talking about packing up, winding down, or leaving. They’ve been very aggressive in their continuation approach.“That’s been their relationship with the NSW Coalition and the Minerals Council. So Gorman North perhaps fits into that narrative.”Sally Hunter, whose husband Geoff Hunter, is on the Narrabri community consultative committee, said they were the ones to inform landholders directly, after spotting ads in the local paper.“No one knew about Gorman North so we ended up telling people about it,” she told Guardian Australia.“Unfortunately, when anyone inquired about it, Whitehaven said, ‘Oh no, you’re talking about the Narrabri underground expansion Stage 3 – here’s where all that information is, go and look at that’.“People were confused. We know of people that rang the company after we told them, and [Whitehaven] sent them on a wild-goose chase because they’ve done nothing to inform anyone in the region.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to The Rural NetworkFree newsletterSubscribe to Calla Wahlquist's fortnightly update on Australian rural and regional affairsEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’ve already got enough mines here.”The OAF can be used to grant licences if the applying company has existing operations adjacent to the exploration zone. The Gorman North zone was set up abutting the north-west edges of Whitehaven’s Narrabri Coal operation.A spokesperson for MEG said “identification as a strategic-release area does not prevent an application under the operational allocation framework”.“The operational allocation pathway requires notification and advertisements, and a market-interest test. The department conducted a market-interest test over the entire Gorman North area. No market interest was received, so the applications were assessed in accordance with the Mining Act 1992 and the operational-allocation guidelines.“If market interest had been received, the department would have considered the strategic release framework for the entire Gorman North area, including a preliminary regional issues assessment.”Whitehaven Coal was approached for comment.

" For humanity to survive, we must make Australia’s politicians feel our fear and ragePeter Garrett and Paul Gilding","Australia needs a mass citizens’ movement, bringing together friend and foe, farmer and city dweller, across generations",,"There are no climate deniers any more. Whatever anger we feel at the opportunities missed, we still celebrate that the battle of ideas, at least, is won.Now there are climate hawks and climate doves. Hawks see a global emergency and the need to mobilise as if human civilisation is at stake. Doves – the moderates in the business community and governments who serve their interests – see a serious environmental problem that we should address, but slowly and without too much disruption, especially to them.While we welcome the “all aboard the climate train” phenomena, we view the rhetoric and support for action over time, and as late as 2050, as disingenuous at best and fatal at worst.Everyone was very excited to see the government’s new climate change plan! | First Dog on the MoonRead moreThat’s because action is needed right now. There is no choice because the world is burning, flooding and melting now. Now is when people’s lives are being lost, and homes destroyed. Now is when billions of dollars of value are being destroyed, with disruptive economic change imminent.Everything happening around the world is exactly as forecast, though earlier than expected. James Hansen, one of the world’s leading climate scientists, addressed the US Congress more than 30 years ago, warning: “If we burn all the fossil fuels, we will destroy the world.”Three decades on every reputable climate scientist agrees with this stark assessment. But now it’s not a forecast, it’s the primary fact against which all actions must be judged.Who can forget the massive wall of fire and smoke that advanced across eastern Australia two summers ago, with scarcely believable scenes of evacuations by warship from beaches where people had fled, and millions of hectares of decimated landscapes and a billion native creatures burnt to death.That same intensity was replicated this year with wildfires in northern Europe and North America, while devastating floods destroyed whole towns in Germany. Then came a rainfall event in China where a years’ rain fell in one day.The political response in Australia? Plans for ramped-up coal and gas exploitation around the nation, including the massive Galilee field in Queensland and Beetaloo basin in the Northern Territory, endorsed by the federal and state governments of both hues. The prime minister is pushing ahead with a “gas-led recovery”, where the super warming gas methane will be pumped into the atmosphere in great volume, accelerating our descent into the fires of a global warming hell.There are few examples in history, short of war, where transformational  change occurred without mass civil uprisingAustralia’s polity is sleepwalking towards the apocalypse, to a state of disequilibrium so wild the Covid pandemic will seem millpond calm by comparison. Our repeated low ranking as a nation taking serious climate measures is hardly surprising, such is the toxic combination of compliant politicians and the greedy cabal of fossil fuel and energy companies intent on prolonging their planet-harming business model.The next phase of the struggle between the climate hawks, now including some big money players, and the climate doves, is under way. The doves still believe you can negotiate with mother nature, that she will slow down physics and chemistry – and climate impacts – while we gently guide our economy to catch up, and that there are windfall profits to be made from the chaos that ensues.At this critical juncture does the climate movement drown, washed away by a rising tide of greenwash and rhetoric, akin to the former prime minister John Howard’s line that “We’re all environmentalists now”. Or is there a surer path that can be taken, leading to genuine security and survival? And what would it take to go down that path?For a start Australia must wake up that the world, and the global economy our prosperity depends upon, is changing around us. Our political leaders’ debates about which industry they do or don’t support are absurd, as if their views impact how the market responds. Despite price gyrations to come, the fossil fuel industry is now in a global death spiral and a new green industry is racing to replace it.We also need a broad citizens’ movement to emerge, with good old-fashioned political organising bringing together friend and foe, farmer and city dweller, across generations, to chart a new and equitable clean energy course.We need to remember that there are few examples in history, short of war, where transformational social change occurred without mass civil uprising.This means sharper-focused civil disobedience, in the Ghandian tradition, on a large scale. We saw this emerge pre-Covid with groups including Extinction Rebellion and the youth climate strikes showing the mainstream environmental movement that taking to the streets is as important, in some cases more important, than clicking our screens or writing reports. To be successful acts of protest must be totally non-violent and genuinely peaceful, or public support will drop. The other element to this approach, personified by Greta Thunberg and the school strikes movement, provide an important lesson to climate emergency advocates. They do not engage in detailed debates about policy and economics. That is the task of experts, not protesters.They simply said listen and then act on the science. Do what the experts say we should do. Don’t look to us for the answer. Don’t let us give you hope. Just do your job as leaders. Act.It will be crucial for the mainstream legal and business worlds to fall in behind this movement. Like the class action launched by eight young people to prevent the approval of a coalmine expansion by environment minister Sussan Ley. Like investors voting down the board of Exxon and demanding the company change.Finally, if we want to achieve the necessary dramatic emissions reductions in the next 10 years they must be delivered by our current political and economic system.As Australia continues to fail on climate, those on the frontline are running out of options, and time | Tessa KhanRead moreThis requires every member of parliament to feel the anger, fear and determination of the Australian people, through all available options including meetings, phone calls, occupation of offices and countless community-focused actions. It’s old school, it can’t always be done virtually, and it can work.The threat here is not to life on Earth. The threat is to humanity and the ecosystems that support us. As the world’s climate scientists note in the latest IPCC report: “Life on Earth can recover from a drastic climate shift by evolving into new species and creating new ecosystems … Humans cannot.” Peter Garrett is a musician, activist and former federal environment minister.

 We need to be told the true climate cost of Schumer and Manchin’s pipeline side dealDavid Sirota and Julia Rock,Democrats hailed the Inflation Reduction Act as a climate crisis victory – so why the secrecy over an oil and gas pipelines bill?,,"As climate change batters America with heatwaves, droughts and floods, lawmakers should be asking a simple question about any bill: does it increase or decrease the greenhouse gas emissions that are fueling the ecological emergency?Somehow, though, that query is still not being asked right now in Washington, even as Democratic leaders are promising to advance a bill to gut environmental laws and expedite oil and gas pipelines.Congress is about to pass a historic climate bill. So why are oil companies pleased? | Kate AronoffRead moreCongressional staffers and environmental groups tell The Lever that they have seen no reliable analyses comprehensively quantifying the climate effects of the initiative. In short: lawmakers appear to be proceeding without any data, even though a draft version of the pipeline bill has been in the public domain since early last month.This is a deliberate deception. After all, last month, Democratic leaders waved around projections of emissions reductions to portray their Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) as a weapon to combat climate change. Indeed, to deflect questions about why fossil fuel companies were lauding the bill, party leaders and their media acolytes pointed to studies – one by an institution with ties to fossil fuel giants – asserting that even with its provisions expanding oil and gas development, the legislation would result in a huge net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.That was the bait, now here’s the switch: those studies did not take into account the pipeline legislation that the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, says was an integral “part of the IRA”. And now neither Schumer nor the groups that created the previous emissions reductions projections are releasing similar analyses about the pipeline proposal that Congress could vote on as soon as this week.The initiative, which is backed by the Biden administration, was originally negotiated between Schumer and Senator Joe Manchin – respectively Congress’s top recipients of utility and fossil fuel industry campaign cash. Though the final text of the measure is still secret, an early leaked draft was emblazoned with the watermark of a powerful oil and gas industry lobbying group.“The fact that emissions projections for Schumer’s side deal have not been discussed either in private or in public point to the reality of what’s at stake here,” said Jim Walsh of the environmental group Food and Water Watch. “Schumer and Manchin’s deal is not talking about clean energy; it’s a fossil fuel payday. The leaked draft specifies the fast-tracking of 19 fossil fuel-related infrastructure projects. Any effort to spin that increased pollution as emissions reduction would be just that – spin.”‘Pipelines are the vast majority of the emissions’Pipeline approvals are not some unimportant side issue in the fight to halt climate change – they are central, according to data from researchers at Michigan Technological University. Their recent study found that pipelines account for nearly half of the United States’ carbon dioxide emissions, because the infrastructure accelerates the distribution and use of fossil fuels.That is in addition to emissions from natural gas pipeline leaks of methane, which is a particularly potent greenhouse gas. Such pipeline leaks are releasing millions of metric tons of methane every year, according to government data cited by the Environmental Defense Fund.What’s more, congressional investigators earlier this year found that “oil and gas companies have internal data showing that methane emission rates from the sector are likely significantly higher than official data reported to [the Environmental Protection Agency] would indicate”.“Allowing any additional fossil fuel infrastructure like pipelines that we put in place locks you into additional fossil fuels,” the Michigan Tech engineering professor Joshua Pearce told The Lever. “The pipelines are [responsible for] the vast majority of the emissions within the United States. To build more of them is really sacrificing the future.”Congress currently has an agency to evaluate the financial cost of proposed bills, but no similar agency to evaluate the climate costs of legislation. That has created a dangerous information vacuum, but in this case one thing is clear: depending on how the final Manchin bill is written, it could undercut projected emissions reductions from other parts of the IRA.“Just looking at a couple pipelines and our public lands gives you a sense of how much damage this could do,” said Jamie Henn, a co-founder of 350.org and director of Fossil Free Media, which is backing a coalition of 1,200 groups opposing the pipeline deal. “The Mountain Valley pipeline is estimated to have the lifetime emissions of approximately 25 coal-fired power plants, the Line 3 pipeline that Biden refused to stop is estimated to have the equivalent emissions of 50 coal-fired power plants, and one-quarter of US emissions since 2005 have come from public lands, which Manchin and the GOP want to open up for more drilling. Start adding these up and we’re talking serious emissions.”Fossil fuel money is flowing to DemocratsEarlier this month, 77 House Democrats released a letter calling on their party leaders to keep Manchin’s pipeline deal out of an unrelated stopgap spending measure. Schumer responded by pledging to include the deal in that spending bill, and Manchin has reportedly been enlisting the help of fossil fuel CEOs to pressure lawmakers.But the pair have continued to refuse to release any data about the climate impacts of their initiative – a stonewalling tactic that serves their campaign donors.For instance: employees from one of the companies leading the West Virginia pipeline project have been funneling cash to Manchin and Schumer – to the point where they are now this election cycle’s second and fifth largest contributors to the duo, respectively. That same company, NextEra, has also dumped more than $400,000 into Democrats’ House and Senate campaign committees.In all, Democratic candidates and committees have vacuumed in more than $13m from donors in the fossil fuel, utility and pipeline industries. Meanwhile, Manchin and Schumer’s former staffers have been hired to lobby for pipeline and utility companies.All of that money and lobbying power doesn’t want anyone asking any inconvenient questions about what the pipeline bill would actually do to the livable ecosystem.They don’t want any inconvenient emissions projections getting in the way of their profits.They want lawmakers flying blind – so they can keep profiting no matter how much worse the climate crisis becomes.

 This article is more than 8 months oldCosta Rica restored its ravaged land to health. The rich UK has no excuse for such complete failureThis article is more than 8 months oldGeorge Monbiot,"Why does a wealthy, powerful nation struggle so badly while a small, much poorer one succeeds? ",,"One of the world’s greatest environmental heroes doesn’t even have a Wikipedia page. Though he has done more to protect the living planet than almost anyone alive, his name is scarcely known. It’s partly because he’s quiet and self-effacing and partly because of a general ignorance about Central America that so few of us have heard of Alvaro Umaña.This might be about to change. He stars in a fascinating film, now released in the Netherlands and negotiating global sales, called Paved Paradise (disclosure: I was also interviewed). It’s the first feature-length documentary I’ve watched that engages intelligently with the most critical environmental issue: land use. By contrast with popular but misguided films such as Kiss the Ground or The Biggest Little Farm, it recognises that sprawling extractive land uses are a lethal threat to the living world. It makes the case that, unless we count the hectares and decide together how best they should be used, we will lose the struggle to defend the habitable planet.Paved Paradise tells the story of the most remarkable ecological turnaround on Earth: the transformation of Costa Rica. From 1986 to 1990, Umaña was environment minister in Óscar Arias’s government. Arias received the Nobel peace prize for his regional diplomacy. But the equally astonishing environmental shift Umaña catalysed is less well known.A Ngäbe-Buglé farmer harvests coffee beans in Tarrazu, south of San José, Costa Rica. Photograph: Jeffrey Arguedas/EPAUntil the Arias government took power, Costa Rica suffered one of the world’s worst deforestation rates: on one scientific assessment, its forest cover fell to just 24.4% of the country. Today, forests occupy 57%, which, Umaña tells me, is close to the maximum: some parts were never forested, while others are now occupied by productive farms and cities. While a small amount of illegal timber felling continues, Costa Rica is the only tropical country to have more or less stopped and then reversed deforestation. It now has one of the world’s highest percentages of protected areas. How did it happen?Umaña persuaded Arias to let him run a new department (energy and environment) with responsibility for protected areas. He saw that the key task was to change financial incentives. Though cattle ranching was unproductive, as the land could support just one cow per hectare, it was marginally more lucrative than allowing the forest to stand.His department calculated the opportunity cost of forgoing a cow at $64 a year, so this was the money it offered for protecting or restoring a hectare of forest. He began by reaching out to small farmers and their representatives, in those regions where people were most sympathetic to the idea. The smallest landholders were offered grants, slightly larger ones were offered soft loans, with the promise that if their forest was still standing after five years, it could serve as the loan’s guarantee. The plan was astonishingly successful: 97% of those who received loans protected or restored the trees on their land. As landholders everywhere saw the scheme made financial sense, it became massively oversubscribed.The former president of Costa Rica, Óscar Arias, who allowed Alvaro Umaña to put together the financial incentives to change land use. Photograph: Jeffrey Arguedas/EPANeeding more money, in 1988 Umaña agreed a debt-for-nature swap with the Dutch government. It would cancel part of the foreign debt if the money Costa Rica would otherwise have spent on servicing it were used instead for forest conservation. Following a change of government, Umaña became the country’s climate ambassador. He helped introduce a special tax of 3.5% on fossil fuels to help pay for forest conservation.Soon the tree protectors began to supplement their income. Tourists are now the country’s second-biggest source of revenue: government figures show that 65% of them list ecotourism as a principal reason for visiting. They come to see toucans, green macaws, howler monkeys, jaguars, caimans, poison dart frogs and other resurgent natural wonders. Landholders can also apply for a licence selectively to fell a small number of their trees, some of which are very valuable.One reason for the programme’s success is its sharing of financial benefits, especially through its world-leading gender action plan. Another is cultural change. In building a new identity around “la pura vida” (the simple life), the government showed that, in combination with economic incentives, national pride can help bring long-established practices such as forest clearance for cattle ranching to an end.Costa Rica helped to inspire the Bonn Challenge, a global programme to restore degraded and deforested land. It launched the international plan to protect 30% of the planet by 2030, and was one of the two founder members, in 2021, of the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (though it has since stood back, following a change of government). These are astonishing achievements for a tiny country.Pacific trade deal ‘will make mockery of UK’s climate ambitions’Read moreCompare this record with policy in the UK, which, 37 years after Umaña set to work, is still pissing about with half-solutions and non-solutions, held to ransom by rich and powerful property owners and entirely incapable of making strategic environmental decisions, especially on land use. While Costa Rica’s wildlife is booming, ours is in freefall. The government seems determined, against all advice, to allow this disastrous trend to continue for the rest of the decade.As for the fuel taxes that could have been used, like Costa Rica’s, to fund ecological repair, the UK government has now forgone a cumulative £80bn in revenue by both abandoning Labour’s fuel duty escalator and giving motorists a special rebate. As a result, our carbon emissions are up to 7% higher than they would otherwise have been.So why does a rich, powerful nation fail, while a small, much poorer one succeeds? Talking to Umaña and researching the history of this transformation suggests a simple answer: quality of government. When governments are committed, decisive and consistent, things happen. When they are beholden to lobby groups, cronyism and corruption, and delegate responsibility to an abstraction called “the market”, they spend decades flapping their hands while chaos reigns.Our self-hating state, which parades its can’t-do culture as a source of pride, insisting that government cannot and should not solve our problems, is constitutionally destined to founder. Why can’t we follow Costa Rica’s example? Because a small but powerful contingent insists on failure.

TV to the rescue! The small screen’s battle to save the planet,"From Blue Planet II to House of Games, programme-makers are putting the climate crisis on screen – and rethinking how the whole industry operates. The aim? Net zero by 2030","['Stuart Heritage', '@stuheritage']","In February, an episode of Richard Osman’s House of Games featured the following question: in the UK, how many plastic bottles does the average person use in a year? The show’s guests were stumped. “There are some people who might have three a day,” mused Josie Long. “But then I was thinking: children and nans, hardly any.” In the end, the answer was 150, a full 20 more than Long’s best guess. “Feels like that number will go down as the years go by,” intoned Osman.It was a tiny moment, and the show quickly moved on. But it stuck with me. Every time I’ve hovered near the chiller cabinet at a shop since then, Osman’s voice has popped into my head. And, chided for my reliance on single-use plastic, I’ve walked away waterless.This was exactly the intended consequence. Because, in a very small way, the House of Games question was designed to help save the world. In January 2021, BBC director general Tim Davie announced a plan to make the entire corporation drastically reduce the amount of carbon it produced, to the point where it would be net zero by 2030.It sounded like an enormous task, because television has always been a wasteful industry. Making programmes often involves travel (frequently in planes or cars), enormous power usage (in the form of lights, generators and satellite trucks, among many other things) and heaps of waste. Last year, a Royal Television Society panel revealed that every single hour of television produced creates a 9.2-tonne carbon footprint, equivalent to the total annual consumption of two households. And that’s across all genres. If you’re making a drama, quadruple that figure.Field work … Chris Packham filming BBC’s Springwatch at RSPB Minsmere in Suffolk. Photograph: Graham Turner/The GuardianFortunately, work is under way to change this. If you’ve watched many British TV shows all the way to the end of the credits, you’ll often see a footstep-shaped logo reading “Albert sustainable production certification” in the corner of the screen. This is a sign the production has taken steps to implement sustainable techniques in order to reduce emissions.Albert began life as a BBC initiative in 2011, its name being an EastEnders reference, but was quickly handed off to Bafta for the good of the wider industry. To qualify for Albert certification, productions need to use a carbon calculator to predict their footprint (all BBC, ITV, Channel 4, UKTV, Sky and British-made Netflix shows must log their footprints on the calculator), before making a plan to shrink it as much as possible.Albert’s communications manager, Genevieve Margrett, was involved right at the start, and remembers how much resistance she received from production teams at the time. “Back in 2011 there was a lot of goodwill, a lot of interest in it,” she says. “But, equally, a lot of production managers just looked at me, horrified. They were a bit like: ‘What? Share our footprint when we’ve got so much on? We’re already running at full speed!’ It was not particularly well received.”The ensuing years have seen a shift in behaviour. The Albert toolkit has become a normal part of the television production process, and those same production managers show more initiative in their approach to reducing emissions. “When we started off,” Margrett recalls, “it was just like: ‘Oh, we’ve reduced our footprint because we’re giving everyone a reusable water bottle.’ It was really basic stuff. But productions are really quite sophisticated now, with the way that they’re trying to tackle the carbon footprint.”A study showed that following Blue Planet II’s call to action, 88% of viewers attempted to modify their behaviourLast year, Springwatch powered its entire slate of outside broadcasts with a hydrogen generator, whose clean energy emits only water and heat as byproducts. DIY SOS is another show that’s also doing an impressive job of producing eco-friendly TV. “On one of their builds, they negotiated with the local water facility to put an extra pipe off the mains facility, so that the mains water could come directly into the location where they were filming,” says Sally Mills, head of sustainability at BBC Studios. As a result, they were able to massively reduce the amount of plastic they used for catering and drinking water, even if it did mean admin-heavy negotiations with utility companies. “This sort of thing takes time and effort, but the productions are pretty engaged and incentivised to try to innovate.”To bring Richard Osman back into the equation, a lot of Albert’s initiatives go beyond the offscreen logistics of making TV. It’s about what happens on screen, too. Last month, Albert issued a tool for editorial teams to ensure carbon reduction remains front and centre of what people at home see. Slipping a question about single-use plastics into a whimsical daytime BBC Two gameshow is just one example of this. So is having The One Show make segments about Earth Day, or including scenes where EastEnders characters discuss energy providers. When Blue Peter launch a green badge to reward environmentally conscientious behaviour or Casualty introduces a fleet of electric ambulances, it all helps remind viewers of the impact they have on the world.‘Even the sponsorship of Love Island is expected to drive more sustainable behaviour’ … contestants wearing pre-worn clothes for a ‘Blue Party’. Photograph: ITV/PAEven the sponsorship of Love Island is expected to drive more sustainable behaviour, having replaced its fast-fashion sponsor with eBay. “There’s research to show searches for particular dresses worn on screen went up massively after each episode,” Margrett says. “But now they’ve pivoted to eBay, that could have a really positive impact on people looking and thinking about pre-loved clothing.”The biggest, most explicit example of onscreen change is the BBC’s Natural History Unit, which now routinely includes unvarnished depictions of humanity’s impact on the environment in its content. A 2018 study showed that following Blue Planet II’s devastating call to action about plastic choking the seas, 88% of viewers attempted to modify their behaviour. What makes this bittersweet, however, is that the BBC wildlife shows seem as though they’re particularly carbon-heavy to make. Producers and crews have to be flown around the world to film their subjects, and often have to buzz unspoiled locations in helicopters to get aerial shots.“There is a lot of travel,” Danielle Mulder, the BBC’s director of sustainability, concedes. “But we’re applying thoughtful green travel wherever possible. Obviously, flying around is a challenge. But the teams use local contractors in other countries as much as possible.” Covid also helped the organisation embrace remote working, she adds, with the likes of Zoom cutting down the amount of travel required.“In the last few years they have pioneered a few clever ways of using drones, which saves on carbon emissions,” says Mills. “We have a database where we share local crew knowledge so, wherever possible, we share people working on different productions in the same place at the same time.”‘We’re applying thoughtful green travel wherever possible’ … David Attenborough in Blue Planet II. Photograph: Gavin ThurstonMy big concern about this drive to net zero – and stick with me on this – had always been Succession. The power-and-wealth drama is a big, expensive series that effectively acts like a travelling circus, traversing the globe as lavishly as possible. It is also the best thing on TV. If broadcasters are aiming to cut down on depictions of people enjoying a high-emissions lifestyle, does that mean a writer who came to a British media company with the next Succession would be rejected?Not so fast, says Margrett. “Yes, Succession does depict a very high-carbon lifestyle, but the characters in it are obviously not really people you aspire to be,” she says. “Also, a really interesting thing that came out of Succession is James Cromwell’s character [Ewan Roy], Logan’s brother. He’s a huge environmentalist. The show had a plotline where he takes all the inheritance that was going to go to Greg, and he gives it to Greenpeace instead. And in real life, this caused an upsurge in people trying to find out how they could also leave money to Greenpeace.”There are seven-and-a-half years left until the target date of 2030, and the progress made so far has been remarkable. But net zero is a big order. Can it be done? “I’m confident we are making progress,” says Mulder. “But it’s not easy, and it’s going to get harder, to be honest with you. We’ve had some quick wins, and switching our fleet to electric vehicles will be another big-ticket win we can pursue. After that you’re getting into the specifics of particular buildings, the gas usage of that building, and its energy optimisation.”The closer to 2030 we get, the more granular the job will become. But time is running out, and the industry is more committed than ever to making net zero happen. “This isn’t just a to-do list,” says Mills. “It’s part of our DNA. This is the heart of who we are.”",2022-07-15
Country diary 1921: the woodland holds its breath,10 December 1921: The noise of one’s feet in the rustling leaves seems almost sacrilege against the stillness,['Helena Swanwick'],"KewOne of those blessed days that come in the middle of fogs and general dismalness; a day which keeps its look of sunrise till noontime; the sky all round the horizon – edged with naked purple trees – a tender topaz colour merging into opal tints above; a lightly shrouded sun. The woodland is holding its breath. The squirrels have not thought it worthwhile to rouse themselves for one odd spring day. Walking among the solemn pale beech-boles, the noise of one’s feet in the rustling leaves seems almost sacrilege against the stillness. One stands quite still to hear one’s heart beating. Then a squawk from a bird overhead relieves the spell and one feels emboldened to kick up the leaves and let the racy smell and the noise of snapping twigs amid the mottling revive memories so infantine that one can find no words for them.As autumn leaves fall, subversion is in the airRead moreWhen one was a child one used to be told it was naughty to walk kicking up the leaves and that they would give one a fever; so when one is old one does it with a lingering agreeable sense of transgression. Then, standing on the edge of the bamboo-garden, freshly green amid the brown, stillness once more falls upon one. The last leaves flicker down slowly and plumb to the ground. As the ear gets used to the silence one distinguishes the low, lisping of the silky leaves, ever so slightly moved by and impalpable wind.",2021-12-06
AnalysisG7 leaders face make-or-break moment in climate crisisFiona Harvey Environment correspondent,Analysis: message in Cornwall is clear – leaders must act now or go down in history as the ones who threw away last-ditch chance ,,"Global leaders arriving in Cornwall for the G7 summit have already found themselves in a changed world: masks and social distancing have replaced the usual hugs, handshakes and cheek-pecking, the entourages have slimmed down, and the usual media circus has been muted, with protesters having to content themselves with writing sand messages on the beach.Boris Johnson has faced ridicule and accusations of hypocrisy for travelling to Carbis Bay by private jet. Some of the other leaders have been more concerned about the extent to which quarantine rules apply to them.But amid the ever-present reminders that 2021 is a year unlike any other, one of the biggest changes will be entirely invisible: carbon dioxide is now at a higher level in the atmosphere than at any point in the last 4m years, newly released data has shown. The world has entered uncharted territory where global heating is concerned, and greenhouse gas emissions are rising strongly still.The message could not be clearer: if the world fails to act now, the future will be changed beyond anything the coronavirus pandemic has brought about. Lord Stern, the climate economist, said: “This is a crucial moment in history. Either we recover [from the pandemic] in a strong and sustainable way, or we do not. We are at a real fork in the road. This decade is decisive.”Scientists have made it clear that greenhouse gas emissions must be halved by 2030 if the world is to stay within 1.5C of global heating – the threshold beyond which extreme weather will take hold, small islands and low-lying areas will face inundation, and swathes of the world will face water stress and heatwaves.Stern pointed to the chequered progress of the past 10 years, in which the cost of renewable energy has plunged and technology such as electric vehicles has increased, but in which progress on cutting emissions overall has been painfully slow. “The last decade was not very good, and this next decade could be just as bad or worse, if we make the wrong choices,” he said.A sand drawing calls on world leaders to ‘share the vaccine and waive the patent’ at Watergate Bay near Newquay, Cornwall. Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/GettyG7 countries are responding: all of the leaders coming to Cornwall – from the US, the UK, Japan, Canada, Germany, France, Italy and the EU – have affirmed their commitment to holding temperature rises to no more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the lower limit set out in the 2015 Paris agreement.All have long-term targets to reach net zero emissions by 2050, and nearly all have targets to cut carbon in the next decade. The UK has led with a goal of cutting emissions by 68% by 2030 and 78% by 2035, based on 1990 levels. The US will halve emissions by 2030, based on 2005 levels, and the EU will make cuts of at least 55% by 2030, on a 1990 baseline.However, current plans under the Paris agreement from Japan and Canada have been criticised by campaigners as inadequate, and they are under pressure to toughen their targets before Cop26, the crucial UN climate talks to be held in Glasgow this November.There has been also been progress in the run-up to the Cornwall summit: all of the G7 countries have agreed to halt the funding of coal and coal-fired power overseas, a huge step forward in making a global move away from the dirtiest fossil fuel.Yet none of this is enough. Global carbon dioxide output is forecast to jump by an almost record amount this year, as the world returns to economic growth using fossil fuels, instead of making the leap needed to renewable and low-carbon energy. G7 countries are falling behind on the “green recovery” from Covid-19 that experts have been urging for more than a year, and reliance on coal has increased in some parts of the world, including the US.The situation is worse in non-G7 countries. China, the world’s biggest emitter and second biggest economy, is not represented at the G7, as a non-democracy and because of its status as a developing country. China’s reliance on coal has increased further in the recovery from Covid-19, despite the country’s long-term goal of net zero emissions by 2050.Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said that while rich countries were cutting their emissions, some developing countries would continue to increase theirs unless they could gain far more investment in shifting to a low-carbon economy.Brexit rains on Boris Johnson’s G7 paradeRead more“More than 90% of emissions in the next two decades will come from emerging economies, but they are less than 20% of global clean energy investments,” he said. “If we can’t accelerate the clean energy transition in these countries, I believe this will be the most critical faultline in global efforts to reach climate goals.”To fund the shift to clean energy, and to cope with the effects of climate breakdown, developing countries will need help from the rich world. So far, promises of finance have not been met. Under a longstanding pledge, made in 2009, poor countries were supposed to receive $100bn a year from public and private sources by 2020. That target has been missed, and the pressure is now on the G7, the grouping of the world’s wealthiest economies, to find a way of plugging the gap – a crucial step in gaining developing countries’ backing for any climate deal at Cop26.Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, said: “If you look at climate finance, we are far behind. Yet [given the sums the G7 are spending on coronavirus] it is pretty clear that there is enough money, and these economies are pumping money into fossil fuels.”Stern has led a call for a doubling of climate finance from public funds in rich countries, from about $30bn in 2018 to about $60bn a year from 2025. Funding for the climate would also need to be accompanied by commitments on vaccine access for poorer countries, as leading figures have repeatedly warned that the two crises are interrelated.Boris Johnson can hope the minor storm over his arrival by private jet will blow over quickly. More damaging is the row he leaves behind him in parliament. The government’s decision to cut overseas aid from 0.7% to 0.5% of GDP has been criticised by former prime ministers and provoked a sizeable rebellion from the prime minister’s own party.At the G7, it has undermined the UK’s stance on climate finance and darkened any prospect of Johnson persuading other world leaders to provide the cash needed to fulfil climate finance promises. Paul Bledsoe, strategic adviser to the Progressive Policy Institute in the US, said: “It’s baffling and heartless. It’s stunning that at a moment of global crisis, as host of G7 and Cop26, the UK is the only country in the world that is reducing aid to the poorest countries.”There are, however, still ways in which the G7 could address climate finance, he said. The International Monetary Fund is offering finance known as “special drawing rights”, that could be used to raise tens of billions for the climate emergency. Poorer countries could also be offered “debt for climate swaps” in which they would be forgiven debt in exchange for preserving forests or other carbon sinks.“The challenge for the G7 is to think creatively about these opportunities,” he said.What is most likely to emerge from the meeting is a fudge of warm words on climate finance, with renewed commitments to long-term goals to reach net zero emissions, and promises of action in the next crucial decade. Whatever the G7 comes up with, however, it is unlikely to measure up to the challenge.Last month, the IEA said that if the 1.5C limit was to be maintained, all further exploration and development of new fossil fuels around the world must cease from this year, and came up with a series of milestones, such as phasing out fossil-fuelled vehicles, and fossil fuels for home heating, in the next two decades.The G7 could make a collective commitment to embrace these policies and goals, said Morgan. “If not, it would be a complete failure of their leadership.”When the G7 leaders fly away from Cornwall’s beaches, the last thing they may see is the writing on the sand, warning of the climate crisis. They will know that they have until November to come up with credible plans for Cop26.“We need to see a positive dynamic for Glasgow,” said Morgan. “If not, they will go down in history as the group of leaders who had the chance of dealing with the climate emergency and who did not step up.”",2020-11-08

 ‘We need your help’: Bishops plead with UK to aid drought-ravaged Horn of Africa,Open letter from 44 Anglican leaders contrasts ‘generous’ British response to Ukraine with ‘dire need’ still unmet in their countries,"['Supported by', 'About this content', 'Lizzy Davies']","Dozens of bishops from drought-ravaged east Africa have appealed to the UK government to urgently get more funding to those in need, warning that Britain’s rapid response to the Ukraine crisis must not come at the expense of lives elsewhere.As the worst drought for four decades tightens its grip on Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya, with millions facing acute hunger, the group of 44 Anglican bishops criticised the international community for not paying attention to early warnings or backing up rhetoric with sufficient funds.“This must change,” write the faith leaders in an open letter seen by the Guardian. “Every day, more lives are lost, and more are at risk.”The group, which includes Justin Badi Arama, archbishop of South Sudan, said that while “another famine is on the horizon”, it is not inevitable.The bishops write: “We call on the UK government to urgently get more funding to the frontline of the hunger crisis in east Africa, and to mobilise the international community to collectively step up.“Early warnings were not heeded. Existing commitments to strengthen resilience have not been backed up by funding that is so desperately needed.”The intervention comes as the UN forecasts a fifth failed rainy season for the Horn of Africa, and is understood to be an attempt to appeal to the conscience of the UK government.Under Boris Johnson, Britain slashed the foreign aid budget by £4bn as it cut the percentage of gross national income from 0.7% to 0.5%. Liz Truss, tipped to follow Johnson as PM, unveiled a new aid strategy earlier this year that was condemned by the opposition as a “double whammy to the world’s poor”.For Ukraine, the UK government says it has provided £220m in humanitarian assistance (a sum dwarfed by the £2.3bn of military support pledged). The bishops, from Kenya and South Sudan, commend that “generous” effort, but warn: “This should not … be a reason to divert humanitarian resources away from regions also in dire need, such as ours.“Saint Paul wrote that we are all part of one body, we are interdependent. For the sake of the whole body, sisters and brothers, we need your help.”The message came as a ship carrying wheat from Ukraine to the Horn of Africa docked in Djibouti, the first to make the journey since the war began in February. The 23,000 tonnes of grain are destined for Ethiopia and will cover 1.5 million people’s needs for a month, a World Food Programme spokesperson said.He cautioned, however, that the delivery was a start that must be followed up by more shipments.Hunger crisis grips Horn of Africa – but 80% of Britons unaware, poll showsRead moreThe bishops’ letter was backed by the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who said: “The crisis in east Africa has been building for at least two years and is now devastating the people of the area and threatening worse. I appeal to our government and to the people of this country: please step forward to enable food to be purchased.”Arama, whose country was the last to declare a famine in some regions, and is prone to severe flooding, said: “People are dying from starvation … We need the international community to act now to help prevent widespread famine. The UK government can help by leading from the front.”Karimi Kinoti of Christian Aid, which is responding to drought pressures in Ethiopia and Kenya, welcomed the letter. “Ministers must speed up the delivery of funding that has already been promised, reverse cuts to international aid and ensure all humanitarian and development funding supports local actors who are best placed to respond quickly,” she said.A spokesperson from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: “The UK has spent £76m so far this year on humanitarian efforts in east Africa, where food insecurity has been made worse by the disruption caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.”",2022-10-19
 This article is more than 10 months oldHave you seen this bug? Scientists call on Britain’s gardeners to track elusive aphidThis article is more than 10 months old,The elusive giant willow aphid goes into hiding in spring. Now the Royal Horticultural Society wants volunteers to help find out why,['Helena Horton'],"Gardeners have been urged by scientists to help find a mysterious bug which disappears in spring and reappears at the end of summer.The Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) is asking people to send in sightings of the giant willow aphid (Tuberolachnus salignus) so that they can find out where it goes and how it interacts with garden plants.At close to 6mm long with a distinctive shark-like fin, it is one of the UK’s largest aphid species, and an RHS team of entomologists is asking gardeners to send pictures if they see it. The team wants to work out why the “mysterious” and “intriguing” garden bug has its fin, and discover more about its lifecycle as well as which plants may host it.Giant willow aphids are regularly seen from July to February, with a peak in sightings in autumn. As the name may suggest, they are found on willow in particular, but the RHS wants to know if they are found on other plants, and especially if they are seen between February and the end of May.Seaweed compost and bean ‘manure’ among RHS garden trends for 2023Read moreThe insects are easy to see with the naked eye but sometimes retreat into crevices in bark to hide from predators. They are usually seen on the stems and branches of trees, and do not cause unsightly damage to host plants, which can withstand the delicate feeding from these insects.In May 2022, colonies were found on a quince tree (Cydonia oblonga) in Hertfordshire, a new host for this aphid. They had previously mainly been found on willow and occasionally on other trees including apple and poplar. Dr Andrew Salisbury, RHS principal entomologist, said: “The sighting of giant willow aphids on quince, a previously unrecorded host, at a time of year when they are rarely seen, only raises more questions about this fascinating and sometimes elusive aphid.“Despite thorough research, it isn’t certain where they go from April to June, and their host range needs more investigation. We are asking gardeners for their help tracking this aphid down to help answer these intriguing questions about this unusual species.”Gardeners are being used more than ever in science experiments as an untapped resource. Private garden space in Britain covers about 728,900 hectares (1.8 million acres) so their potential as a haven for wildlife is considerable. The RHS’s chief ecologist, Gemma Golding, recently asked gardeners to send pictures of interesting “weeds” in the hope that rare wild plants are discovered growing in new places.The RHS has also taken more of an interest in wildlife-friendly gardening in recent years, with painstakingly maintained and sterile gardens becoming a thing of the past.The RHS, which runs Chelsea Flower Show, has changed its attitude to previously unwanted visitors to the garden, last year announcing it would no longer class slugs and snails as pests. Britain’s leading garden charity said that although the gastropods were the garden visitor about which they received most complaints, they should be considered an important part of the garden ecosystem. At RHS flower shows, you are now just as likely to receive tips for how to entice nature into your garden as you are to see perfectly pruned roses.Sightings of the giant willow aphid, which must include a picture, can be submitted to the RHS here.",2023-02-12
How impact of bad roads can be worse than an earthquake,Ten-year study of a town in Turkey showed poor construction caused more than 90% of landslips,['Kate Ravilious'],"Badly built roads can generate more hazard than a significant earthquake, research shows. Hakan Tanyaş, from the University of Twente in the Netherlands, and colleagues monitored the size and number of landslips in the Arhavi area of north-eastern Turkey between 2010 and 2020. During this period several roads were constructed through the region to access a new hydroelectric scheme.The scientists show that development had a shocking impact on the stability of the hillsides, with road construction responsible for more than 90% of the observed landslips in the region.Their calculations, reported in the Natural Hazards journal, suggest the volume of debris created by these excess landslips is equivalent to the area being shaken by a magnitude 6 earthquake.Because much of this sediment ends up in rivers, the scientists say it will change the way rivers flow and increase the probability and severity of flooding.Writing in The Landslide Blog, Dave Petley from the University of Sheffield, says road-induced landslides are a global issue. “The sad element of this is that these landslides almost entirely avoidable – such road-related landslide impacts are down to poor engineering practice.“Roads do not need to be built in this way, and there are plenty of examples of good practice from around the world.”",2022-02-02
 US watchdog plans to make companies reveal greenhouse-gas emissions,Climate action rules announced by SEC chair Gary Gensler expected to face opposition from Republicans and industry groups,"['Dominic Rushe', '@dominicru']","The US’s top financial watchdog proposed on Monday that publicly traded companies report information on their greenhouse-gas emissions and even those of their suppliers and consumers in one of the Biden administration’s most sweeping environmental actions to date.The new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules faces staunch opposition from some politicians and members of the business community and will be open to public comment for at least two months before final rules are released.Oil companies blame clean energy transition for market volatilityRead more“I am pleased to support today’s proposal because, if adopted, it would provide investors with consistent, comparable and decision-useful information for making their investment decisions, and it would provide consistent and clear reporting obligations for issuers,” said the SEC chair, Gary Gensler.The proposal, which has been in the works for over a year, would force companies to make public the extent of their carbon footprint. While some companies including Apple and Microsoft now publish detailed analyses of their emissions, others have been reluctant to improve disclosure.Under the proposal publicly traded companies would have to report greenhouse-gas emissions and obtain independent certification of their estimates. Some companies would also be required to report emissions from both their supply chains and consumers, known as Scope 3 emissions.Republicans and some industry groups have already begun lobbying against the new requirements, which they argue would increase costs and go beyond the SEC’s mandate.In a speech last year Gensler said the rules would introduce consistency to company reporting at a time when investors were increasingly concerned about the impact of climate on businesses.“Today, investors increasingly want to understand the climate risks of the companies whose stock they own or might buy. Large and small investors, representing literally tens of trillions of dollars, are looking for this information to determine whether to invest, sell, or make a voting decision one way or another.Investors are looking for consistent, comparable, and decision-useful disclosures so they can put their money in companies that fit their needs,” he said.",2022-03-21
" Cop26 is doomed, and the hollow promise of ‘net zero’ is to blameYanis Varoufakis",Net zero is popular among polluters for good reason – it’s toothless compared to emissions restrictions and a carbon tax,,"“Make no mistake, the money is here, if the world wants to use it,” said Mark Carney, the former Bank of England governor who today serves as UN climate envoy, while also representing an alliance of financiers sitting on a pile of $130tn worth of assets. So, what does the world want? If only humanity had the power to organise a global poll based on one-human-one-vote, such a species-wide referendum would undoubtedly deliver a clear answer: “Do whatever it takes to stop emitting carbon now!” Instead, we have a decision-making process culminating in the colossal fiasco currently unfolding in Glasgow.The failure of Cop26 reflects our failed democracies on both sides of the Atlantic. President Biden arrived in Glasgow as his people back in Washington were pushing his infrastructure bill through Congress – an exercise that decoupled the bill from any serious investment in renewables and funded an array of carbon-emitting infrastructure such as expanded roads and airports. Meanwhile in the European Union, the rhetoric may be painted in bright green, but the reality is dark brown – with even Germany looking forward to copious amounts of Russian natural gas in exchange of green-lighting the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. The EU should be creating a pan-European Renewable Energy Union, but alas our leaders are not even debating this idea.There are three reasons Cop26 is proving such a spectacular debacle. The first reason is a planet-wide collective action problem over “free-riding”. Large businesses, as well as states, take a leaf out of St Augustine’s prayer, “Lord please make me chaste but not just yet”. Everyone prefers a planet on which no one emits carbon to a planet that sizzles. But everyone also prefers to delay paying the cost of transition if they can get away with it. If the rest of the planet does the right thing, the planet is saved, even if you selfishly postpone your own conversion to environmental probity. And if the rest of the planet does not do the right thing, why be the one sucker who does?The second reason is a global coordination failure. In one sense, Carney is correct: mountain ranges of cash are lying idly in the global financial system, its ultra-wealthy owners keen to invest it in low-carbon activities. But a private investment in, say, green hydrogen will only return profits if many other investors invest in it too – and so the investors all sit around waiting for each other to be the first. Meanwhile, corporations, communities and states join this waiting game, unwilling to take the risk of committing to green hydrogen until big finance does. Tragically, there is no global coordinator to match the available money, technologies and needs.The third reason is simply: capitalism. It has always gained pace through the incessant commodification of everything, beginning with land, labour and technology before spreading to genetically modified organisms, and even a woman’s womb or an asteroid. As capitalism’s realm spread, price-less goods turned into pricey commodities. The owners of the machinery and the land necessary for the commodification of goods profited, while everyone else progressed from the wretchedness of the 19th century working class to the soothing fantasies of mindless petit-bourgeois consumerism.Everything that was good was commodified – including much of our humanity. And the bad externalities that the same production process generated were simply released into the atmosphere. To power the capitalist juggernaut, carbon stored for millennia in trees and under the surface was plundered. For two centuries immense wealth – and corresponding human misery – was produced by exploitative processes that depleted “free” natural capital, carbon in particular. Workers around the world are now paying the cost to nature that the capitalist market never bore.Free-marketeers would like us to believe that business has now yielded to science, and is ready and willing to step into the void of government inaction. We must not believe this for a moment. Yes, Carney is right that the money for the belated green transition is available, and it is ample. Those who possess it will undoubtedly invest it to supply, say, green hydrogen if we, society, pay them to do so. But at the same time, they will not voluntarily cease production processes that continue releasing carbon into the atmosphere.This is why polluters adore net zero targets: because they are a brilliant cover for not restricting emissions. In exchange for non-verifiable offsets, they are allowed to continue plundering the planet’s remaining stored carbon, until the point arrives when their marginal private cost surpasses their revenue from the last unit sold. By cynically placing net zero at its centre, Cop26 became nothing more than an expensive cover-up for continued toxic emissions. Hiding behind Cop26, the great and the good lie to the young, lie to vulnerable people and even lie to themselves by repeating the truth that the “money is there” to be invested in the planet’s salvation.What needs to be done? Two things at the very least. First, a complete shutdown of coalmines and new oil and gas rigs. If governments can lock us down to save lives during a pandemic, they can shut down the fossil fuel industry to save humanity. Second, we need a global carbon tax, to increase the relative price of everything that releases more carbon, and from which all proceeds should be returned to the poorer members of our species.To earn a shot at rising to the greatest challenge humanity has ever faced, we must first confront both the funders and the owners of the fossil fuel industries. Though this clash will not guarantee our future, it is a necessary condition for us to have one. Yanis Varoufakis is the co-founder of DiEM25 (Democracy in Europe Movement)",2021-11-10
 This article is more than 6 months oldScottish government ditches controversial marine protection planThis article is more than 6 months old,"Backlash against proposal has united communities, campaigners and parts of fishing industry

UK politics live – latest updates
","['Libby Brooks', ' Scotland correspondent']","The Scottish government has ditched controversial marine protection plans after a furious backlash that united coastal communities, grassroots campaigners and sectors of the fishing industry.Holyrood’s net zero secretary, Màiri McAllan, promised “further community and industry engagement” as she announced on Thursday the end of proposals to implement highly protected marine areas (HPMAs) that would impose strict limits on human activity such as fishing, aquaculture and tourism in at least 10% of Scotland’s waters by 2026.Restating her government’s commitment to enhanced marine protection, McAllan said a new pathway and timetable would be published after the summer recess.Advocates say “no-take zones” are a moderate step, widely used across Europe and piloted in England by the UK government, and that they are essential for the recovery of depleted coastal fish stocks and seabeds. Local attempts to “rewild” the sea, such as the no-take zone established in 2008 in Lamlash Bay on Arran, have been successful, they add.But grassroots campaigners, usually at odds with each other over other issues, argued the plans – a key part of the Bute House agreement that brought the Scottish Greens into government with the SNP in 2021 – would devastate island cultures, in particular. The Scottish government also faced cross-sector criticism of the policy as poorly evidenced and dismissive of local experience.The plans exposed significant tensions within the SNP, in particular over the influence of its Green governing partners on controversial policy and a Holyrood vote on the subject resulting in the first backbench rebellion since Humza Yousaf became first minister.Responding to McAllan’s statement, the Scottish Greens coastal communities spokesperson, Ariane Burgess, accused opposition parties of trying to “weaponise the nature emergency” and welcomed the commitment to “community-led input”.The former SNP leadership contender Kate Forbes, who rebelled against her government on the issue, said the announcement would “come as an immense relief to those who understood the risk to coastal communities from the very beginning”.“It is now critical that any new proposals for marine protected areas take into account communities’ views, fishermen’s lived experiences and the importance of a truly just transition,” she said.Phil Taylor, the director of the conservation charity Open Seas, who previously spoke of “complete entrenchment” over the proposals, said: “The Scottish government are now learning an important lesson that deep community engagement and participation is fundamental to effective environmental action.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

 Lula vows to undo environmental degradation and halt deforestation,President-elect says he will work to save Amazon rainforest and key ecosystems in rousing Cop27 speech,"['Patrick Greenfield', ' and ', 'Fiona Harvey', ' in Sharm el-Sheikh']","President-elect Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has told the world that “Brazil is back” at Cop27, vowing to begin undoing the environmental destruction seen under his far-right predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, and work towards zero deforestation of the Amazon rainforest.Followed by a carnival atmosphere wherever he went on Wednesday, Lula told the climate summit that his administration would go further than ever before on the environment by cracking down on illegal gold mining, logging and agricultural expansion, and restoring climate-critical ecosystems.In his first big overseas speech since winning election, Lula said Brazil did not need to clear another hectare of rainforest to be a major agricultural producer, and he would use his presidency to demand that rich countries deliver on their promise of $100bn of climate finance for developing countries and to create a fund for loss and damage finance.Punctuated by chants of “olé, olé, olé, ola, Lula, Lula”, the president-elect’s speech brought a much-needed feeling of hope to Cop27.“Ole, ole, ola… Lula… Lula”Big crowds waiting for @LulaOficial to speak at a side event at #Cop27 pic.twitter.com/cZuTWWL1rY— Patrick Greenfield (@pgreenfielduk) November 16, 2022
Leading Brazilian environmental figures were always nearby, including climate the scientist Carlos Nobre whose studies warn the Amazon is close to crossing an irreversible tipping point, and the former environment minister Marina Silva who oversaw an enormous drop in deforestation during Lula’s first presidency.“Today, I am here to say that Brazil is ready to join once again [the] effort to build a healthier planet. Brazil has just ended elections, one of the most decisive in its history. It was followed in an unprecedented way by other countries. It could help control the rise of the authoritarian right and climate deniers around the world,” Lula said.Of the impact of the climate crisis, he said “nobody is safe”, detailing the consequences of global heating. “In the US, they live with tropical storms and more and more powerful hurricanes … In Brazil, which is a forest and hydrological power, we experienced drought and devastating floods. Europe faces extreme heat with fires and unprecedented deaths. And although it is the continent with the lowest greenhouse gas emissions, Africa has drought in Chad, Kenya and Somalia. I repeat: nobody is safe.”In a speech that ranged from inequality to reform of the UN security council, Lula placed a lot of emphasis on building partnerships. He vowed to work with other Amazonian countries – including Peru, Colombia, Guyana and Venezuela – to work towards sustainable development in the region while also protecting key ecosystems, early in his presidency.“There is no planetary security without a protected Amazon. We will do whatever it takes to have zero deforestation and degradations of our biomes. For this reason, I would like to announce that efforts to fight climate change will have the highest priority in my next government. We will prioritise the fight against deforestation of all of our biomes and reverse damage done in recent years by the previous government,” Lula said.Around the world, he underscored Brazil’s new partnership with Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo – the big three rainforest nations – to work together on their conservation.“The planet warns us at every moment that we need each other to survive. Alone we are vulnerable to the climate tragedy. Nevertheless we ignored these warnings … We have spent trillions of dollars that only result in destruction and death. We experience a moment where we have multiple problems: nuclear war, crisis of food supply, energy, erosion of biodiversity, inequality … These are hard times. But it was always in difficult times that humanity overcame challenges. We need more confidence,” he said.“We need more resources for a problem that was created by rich countries but is disproportionally felt by the most vulnerable … I would like to remind you that rich countries said they would raise $100bn at Cop15 in Copenhagen to help the less developed countries to face climate change.There were queues at the venue for Lula’s speech an hour before it began, and an overspill room was also packed. At a side event earlier that day, he said that Brazil should host Cop30 in 2030 in the Amazon in part to display its importance to the world.The G20 communique lifted spirits at the Cop as it contained language on keeping to the 1.5C temperature limit and the need to address loss and damage, meaning the financial assistance needed for poor countries to respond to climate disaster – a key bone of contention.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Read moreThe first official draft text of the “cover decision” of the Cop would come late on Wednesday night, the Egyptian climate envoy, Wael Aboulmagd, told journalists earlier in the day. Some delegations are worried that the time for consultation and reaction to the draft seems to have been compressed to about one day, compared with about two and a half days last year at Cop26 in Glasgow.Most are expecting the cover decision – a discursive document running to several pages and describing a long series of resolutions and commitments on everything, from cutting emissions to funding adaptation measures – to be the key outcome of these talks. In it, they are hoping for affirmation that countries are still committed to vital goals, such as the 1.5C temperature limit, and phasing down coal.But the Guardian understands that a few countries are still questioning whether a lengthy cover decision is even needed, which could delay its drafts even further.In a sign that deep divisions remain on key issues, the Alliance of Small Island States, representing some of the most vulnerable countries, took aim at unnamed rich countries over loss and damage. Sir Molwyn Joseph, minister of health, wellness and the environment for Antigua and Barbuda, said: “Some developed countries are furiously trying to stall progress and, even worse, attempting to undermine small island developing states. Not only are they causing the worst impacts of the climate crisis, they are playing games with us in this multilateral process.”Frans Timmermans, vice-president of the European Commission, said the EU was supportive of loss and damage but said some countries currently classed as developing were now prosperous enough to contribute to loss and damage funding.He added that the proposal by some developing countries for a new loss and damage funding facility would hold up the delivery of finance, because it could take years to get started, whereas using existing institutions to deliver funding could be done faster. “Let’s start funding loss and damage now, because if it’s a [new] facility we all know it will take years,” he said.Egypt has appointed pairs of ministers, one from a developed and one from a developing country, for each of the outstanding big issues, including loss and damage, climate finance, and adaptation, in an effort to move negotiations faster.",
,"Kilter Rural’s multi-gigalitre water donation may be a model that brings together farmers, First Nations people and environmentalists

","['Supported by', 'About this content']","The largest private water donation in Australian history could help restore wetlands in the Murray-Darling Basin thanks to a new financial model benefiting investors, farmers, First Nations people and the environment.The Australian natural capital investment company, Kilter Rural, has announced it will donate 5.4 gigalitres of water to 21 wetlands covering approximately 1,600 hectares in the southern Murray-Darling Basin next financial year – in addition to 3.8 gigalitres donated this financial year.The environmental water is being bought through Kilter’s $85m Murray-Darling Basin Balanced Water Fund and delivered through the company’s partnership with The Nature Conservancy (TNC), the Murray Darling Wetlands Working Group (MDWWG) and four First Nations communities.Prof Sue Jackson, of the Australian Rivers Institute at Griffith University, says the donation was significant because “most of the environmental watering that goes on in the Murray-Darling Basin is done by government environmental water managers … so this brings another set of players from the private sector into the restoration of rural landscapes”.Jackson says it provided a progressive social impact model of investment for people that wanted to see environmental as well as economic gains.Euan Friday, the chief investment officer at Kilter Rural, says “this is the largest voluntary private donation of water to threatened wetlands in history and it has been made while delivering exceptional returns to investors”.Private water donations may be a way for environmentalists and business to work together. Middle Wetland, NSW. Photograph: MDWWGThe Kilter Balanced Water Fund delivered 19.4% to investors in the past 12 months and has delivered an annualised 14.1% since inception, according to Friday.The company generates income by renting the permanent water entitlements they own and a portion of the profit that is made on the water trades is then used to buy water for the environment.Friday says they developed the model with TNC, who suggested water donations be made on a countercyclical basis, meaning they can make “bigger donations when it’s wet because … the allocation price is low and therefore the opportunity cost is low”.The fund has been donating water since 2015 but, off the back of an abundance of water in the system, is set to make its biggest donation.Dr James Fitzsimons, the director of conservation and science at TNC, says “the way that fund works is it sort of mimics the natural flows in the Murray-Darling Basin – the basin’s renowned for its boom and bust cycles for climate and water”.“In dry times, less water gets delivered to the environment and more is made available back on to the market for farmers and irrigators to purchase,” Fitzsimons says.“And then wetter times a larger donation to the environment is made. And that might seem counterintuitive, but there are many wetlands that actually don’t receive water in very wet years. They might be disconnected from the floodplain, they might not have the connections to the river system that they did in the past.”A black swan swims in Andruco Lagoon, NSW. Photograph: Ian Mckenzie/MDWWGReviving CountryFitzsimons says the donations have targeted wetlands systems typically on private land that wouldn’t otherwise get water under watering regimes from the federal or state governments.Dr Deborah Nias, the CEO of the Murray Darling Wetlands Working Group (MDWWG), says her organisation identifies and assess the wetlands to be receiving water , apply the water into the sites, conduct monitoring and build up the groundwork for ongoing support into future.Inundations of wetland areas to date have provided critical habitat for water birds, with monitoring already showing an increase in bird diversity of up to 212% and an increase in bird abundance of 282%.The donation is also supporting the return of endangered species to the wetlands, including the southern bell frog, eastern regent parrot and Murray hardyhead fish.

Four First Nations communities have also gained access to water for their traditional lands under the program, and been part of monitoring efforts, as well as the discussions around which culturally significant tree and animal species the MDWWG should work to protect.Malcolm King, a Barkandji man and senior ranger with the Barkindji Maraura Elders Environment Team, has seen water returned to the creek running into Fletchers lake thanks to the donation.King says the land is sacred with burials, scar trees, ancient fireplaces and shell middens. However, the plant and animal life integral to these sacred spaces, including the Barkandji’s totem species the wedge-tailed eagle, had been struggling due to the water drying up too quickly.Now, the water allocation King has overseen has meant there has been enough moisture to regenerate species like the River Cooba tree, while elders have reported seeing species of ducks that had not been seen in over 50 years.King says the donation is “very important to us. Water revives the country, it revives life around the natural creek, the natural waterways, the natural swamps.”In addition to the Barkindji Maraura Elders Environment Team, Nias says the Nari Nari Tribal Council, the Barkandji Native Title Group Aboriginal Corporation and the Yarkuwa Indigenous Knowledge Centre have also collaborated with the wetlands working group.The Murray Darling’s Bigger PictureThe environmental water donated by Kilter Rural is additional to the environmental water targets of the Murray Darling Basin Plan.As Nias puts it, “we’re not trying to do government’s job for it, we were adding to the outcomes that the Basin Plan will achieve.”David Papps, the former commonwealth environmental holder, says while the donation is very positive, it won’t help the Murray Darling Basin Plan reach the target of 450 GL water saved for the environment by 2024, which the authority has warned for years is lagging behind schedule.Christine Freak, the policy manager at the NSW Irrigators’ Council, has highlighted that irrigation bodies such as Coleambally Irrigation and Renmark Irrigation Trust are working with government to deliver environmental water, as part of a paradigm shift she says is moving beyond the “toxic and divisive water policy debate”.Freak says “with the world population forecast to reach 9 billion by 2050, it is critical that we have food systems integrated with environmental management, and not think they have to be mutually exclusive.”“The policies which pit irrigators against the environment … in a false dichotomy are in no one’s interest,” she says.“We hope government can see the paradigm has shifted, and have the leadership to move forward, working with farmers and basin communities to look after our environments together.”Inundations have seen increases in birdlife diversity, such as this eastern great egret and these yellow-billed spoonbills at Yambuna Lagoon in Victoria. Photograph: TNC/Natalie HollandThe new Labor government has committed to implement the plan in full, with five measures to achieve this.However, Papps says “it’s going to have to be a remarkable change from what we’ve seen under the Coalition government for the past few years.”Nias says she believes the value of the private water donation goes beyond ecological benefits and investor return.“I think the value of what we’re doing here is demonstrating that agriculture, environmental water, First Nations, people, landholders, business, we can all work together.“And we can work together in a way that helps everybody get positive outcomes. And it doesn’t have to be a bitter argument, it can be done in a collaborative fashion,” Nias says.",2022-06-01
 Beaver-themed rewilding garden wins Chelsea flower show top prize,Unconventional garden by Lulu Urquhart and Adam Hunt features a dam and sticks pre-gnawed by beavers,"['Caroline Davies', ' and ', 'Helena Horton']","A garden with hardly a bloom in sight and inspired by the dramatic transformation of land through the reintroduction of beavers to the UK has won best in show at the Chelsea flower show.The garden – A Rewilding Britain Landscape by first-time Chelsea designers Lulu Urquhart and Adam Hunt – may lack eye-catching flowers but features a beaver dam, a pool with a lodge behind it, a shabby shed with corrugated iron roof and UK native plants.Judges were won over by its evocation of a rewilded landscape in south-west England, which used West Country stone, reclaimed timber and sticks pre-gnawed by beavers – with the dam representing a re-established colony of the keystone species.Beavers have been reintroduced to parts of the country after becoming extinct in the UK 400 years ago. The garden, designed for the charity Rewilding Britain, aimed to show their role as incredible bioengineers within a natural ecosystem, and incorporated crack willow, hawthorn and alder.Unusually for the show, native grasses are shown as they would be seen in the wild, with their previous year’s growth and their pre-season seed-head remnants left on, together with the brown, former season’s dead foliage. A soundscape included the tail slap of the beaver and the creature’s mewing.“It was a hard-fought debate between members of the judging panel to decide which garden to award best in show. In the end, all the judges were captivated by the skill, endeavour and charm of A Rewilding Britain Landscape – every step is exquisite,” said James Alexander-Sinclair, the Royal Horticultural Society chair of judges.Urquhart and Hunt, based in Bruton in Somerset, have stressed the principles of rewilding are not just for the countryside. Urquhart told the Guardian it was “saying give space to nature with this garden”.“Like we’re not necessarily just talking about gardening. Leave some areas. Rewilding Britain is about the marginal areas. This may not be a formal garden, but we are trying to show you what you see out in nature when it’s colonising itself, is a lovely mix of shrubs, trees, grassland, meadows. And that gives rise to mass habitat for birds, fish, amphibians, insects, and that’s what we’re trying to show you in a kind of nano-space.Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am“It was fun to sort of mess things up a bit – we didn’t want our plants to look like they’d been in a pot. We wanted them to look wild.”Hunt said: “When we design, we try to look at habitat, as well as an aesthetic beauty. When you realise what habitat does, what it can look like, you can start to find it beautiful. It’s about leaving a little part of your garden wild, unmowed.“Why not leave some hawthorn in the corner with some nettles under it – that’s creating habitat. I mean this is a piece of wildland – it’s definitely not a traditional garden, but all these plants in the appropriate conditions will do very well in a garden.”Best construction in the show garden category went to the Building the Future Garden, designed for Medite Smartply by RHS Chelsea’s most decorated designer Sarah Eberle for her creation showcasing sustainable construction materials in an “edge-of-the-forest” setting and featuring a waterfall.Gold medal winners in the show garden category included The Mind Garden by Crocus, designed for the mental health charity by Andy Sturgeon, and featuring a series of curved walls in meadow planting to highlight how nature can provide a refuge.There was gold too for The Meta Garden, Growing the Future by Joe Perkins, who emphasised the inseparable connection between plants and fungi within woodland ecosystems. Inspired by the complex mycelium networks that connect and support woodland life, the garden aimed to highlight the beauty and versatility of timber, and the critical role of nature-based solutions, such as tree planting and forest management, in tackling the climate crisis.",
 Cop26: African nations seek talks on $700bn climate finance deal ,Negotiators say funding needed to speed up decarbonisation and help developing countries to adapt,"['Supported by', 'About this content', 'Jonathan Watts', '@jonathanwatts']","African nations want Cop26 to open discussions this week on a mega-financing deal that would channel $700bn (£520bn) every year from 2025 to help developing nations adapt to the climate crisis.Tanguy Gahouma-Bekale, the chair of the African Group of Negotiators on climate change, said the increased finance was needed for the accelerated phase of decarbonisation required to hold global heating to 1.5C.These funds would also be essential, he said, to cope with the impacts, including fiercer heat, widening droughts and more intense storms and floods, which are using up an increasingly large share of GDP. According to a recent study, some African nations are already spending more on climate adaptation than on healthcare and education.“The work on this needs to start now,” said the climate diplomat from Gabon. “Talks about finance take time so we need to have a roadmap now with clear milestones on how to achieve targets after 2025 to ensure the money flows every year.”It is also a question of justice. The climate problem was largely created by Europe, North America and east Asia, but the worst impacts are in the southern hemisphere. In 2009, rich nations promised $100bn a year, which was considered a downpayment and an important gesture of trust.What is Cop26 and why does it matter? The complete guide Read moreUntil now, they have welched on the deal by providing only 80% of what they had promised. For the African group, Glasgow is a time to make amends and lift the level of support in line with the greater urgency demanded by science.The money is needed immediately, say negotiators. According to a recent study by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, Cameron devotes close to 9% of its GDP on climate adaptation, Ethiopia 8%, Zimbabwe 9%, while Sierra Leone, Senegal and Ghana are all more than 7%. Even with these high shares of domestic funding, the study found a gap of about 80% between need and expenditure.Gahouma-Bekale, who also serves as special adviser to the Gabonese president, Ali Bongo, said the opening phase of Cop26 had pushed the world in a more positive direction, but words needed to be backed by actions in the second week.“We have received some assurance during the world leaders’ summit that they really want to close the gap and we have seen strong announcements on deforestation and methane,” he said. “What we want to see now is implementation. Only implementation can give us the assurance we need that we can keep warming to 1.5C.”Africa accounts for less than 4% of historical global emissions, compared with 25% for the USA, 22% for the EU and 13% for China. But it has suffered many of the most devastating effects of climate disruption, recently including droughts in the Sahel and floods in the Nile delta. In future, it is expected to be among the most vulnerable regions of the world to heatwaves and crop failures.00:05:18Why the world is getting hotter and how you can help – video explainerSome African countries have shown leadership. Gabon is among a handful of nations that already have a carbon-negative economy because its vast tropical forests in the Congo Basin absorb more greenhouse gases than its factories, cars and cities emit. It has recently passed an ambitious climate law that aims to ensure the country remains dependant on forests and agriculture rather than the fossil fuel industry. To achieve this goal, it needs outside support so that the government can continue to raise living standards.Many African nations depend on coal for electricity and did not join a declaration this week by more than 40 countries to quit this most polluting of fossil fuels. Gahouma-Bekale said this pledge was an important step forward, but developing nations would need more time.“This is very good news for the world,” he said. “If we want to succeed with the Paris goals, then we must phase out all fossil fuels, and coal is among them. But our situation in Africa is different. We are still on our way to be developed. We can’t drastically stop coal and oil. For now we need to use it to eradicate poverty and access to energy. We will need support for the transition. And we need to be flexible. For five to 10 years, we must do the two together [coal and renewables] so the transition can be smooth.”That transition will depend on a flow of funding. African nations insist wealthy countries are held as rigorously to account on their finance promises as they are on emissions reductions. That means regular reporting on the levels of support provided, needed and received.“What we want to achieve at this Cop is a transparency framework with strong rules on accounting,” said Gahouma-Bekale. This article was amended on 9 November 2021. It is the USA that is responsible for 25% of historical global emissions, not China as an earlier version said.",2022-10-19

The Minns government was roundly criticised by environmental groups for excluding the 2035 target from its climate bill. Australia’s former chief scientist, Prof Penny Sackett, last month urged the government to include it.The government needs the support of either the opposition or the crossbench – including the Greens – to pass the bill. It was due to be debated in NSW parliament on Thursday but has now been delayed until next week.The Greens had already vowed to vote against the bill unless it was strengthened and criticised the government for “abandoning” the 2035 target. The minor party confirmed on Thursday it would support amending the bill to include the target.NSW minerals lobby advertising blitz doesn’t come clean on the dirty realities of coalmining | Temperature CheckRead moreGuardian Australia understands the Liberals and Nationals jointly agreed to push for a stronger interim target along with other amendments they believed would protect people living in rural and regional areas affected by the energy transition.It is understood those amendments would guarantee the state’s agricultural commissioner and a representative of people working in the energy industry two seats on the new Net Zero Commission.The commission would be created under the legislation and act as an independent advisory panel to monitor the state’s progress toward its emissions reduction goals.The government planned to have the commission comprised of between five and 10 members who were academics or industry representatives working in fields such as decarbonisation or renewable energy – as well as the chief scientist.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

 ​Fossilised long-legged giant penguin identified as new species,Skeleton found by children in New Zealand helps fill in gaps in natural history,['Sofia Quaglia'],"In January 2006 a group of children in summer camp in Waikato, New Zealand, went on a fossil-hunting field trip with a seasoned archaeologist. They kayaked to the upper Kawhia harbour, a hotspot for this sort of activity, and they expected to find fossils of shellfish and the like, as they regularly did on these Hamilton junior naturalist club expeditions.But on this day, just before heading home, close to where they’d left the kayaks and well below the high tide mark, they noticed a trace of fossils that looked like much more than prehistoric crustaceans. After careful extraction, an archaeologist later identified it as the most complete fossilised skeleton of an ancient giant penguin yet uncovered.According to a study newly published in the Journal of Vertebrate Palaeontology by Massey University scientists, it was a new species of prehistoric penguin. The discovery is helping scientists fill in some gaps in natural history. Penguin species have a fossil record dating almost as far back as the age of the dinosaurs and can say a lot about the ecology of the past and the present.“Finding fossils near where we live reminds us that we share our environment with animals who are the descendants of lineages that reach back into deep time,” said Mike Safey, the Hamilton junior naturalist club’s president, who has overseen all work on the fossil penguin since its discovery. “We should act as kaitiaki – guardians – for these descendants if we want to see these lineages continue into the future.”a) Line drawing of specimen; b) photo of specimen; c) size comparison of Kairuku waewaeroa and an emperor penguin. Photograph: Journal of Vertebrate PaleontologyA month after the discovery the team returned to the location with equipment ranging from petrol-powered concrete saws and electric jackhammers to chisels and crowbars, and children and adults alike spent a day cutting the fossil out of the sandstones. It was donated to the Waikato Museum, Te Whare Taonga o Waikato, and researchers from Massey University and Bruce Museum started to conduct cutting-edge studies on the fossil.The scientists concluded that the penguin is between 27.3 and 34.6m years old and is from a time when much of Waikato was under water, according to Daniel Thomas, a senior lecturer in zoology from Massey’s School of Natural and Computational Sciences.“The penguin is similar to the Kairuku giant penguins first described but has much longer legs,” Thomas said. That’s why it’s been called waewaeroa, which is Māori for “long legs”. Having legs this long would have made this species much taller than other ancient giant penguins, and it is estimated that it was about 1.6 metres long from toe to beak tip and 1.4 metres tall when standing up. This, in turn, would affect how fast it could swim and how deep it could dive.“Giant penguins like Kairuku waewaeroa are much larger than any diving seabird today, and we know that body size can be an important factor when thinking about ecology,” Safey said. “How and why did penguins become giant, and why aren’t there any giants left? Well-preserved fossils like this can help us address these questions.”Little is known about the existence of giant penguins in New Zealand, especially since records from the North Island have long been limited to a few fragmentary specimens. So adding this new information to the rich fossil record of penguins provides insight into how penguins adapted, and the evolution of the art of adaptation itself.Discovering that this fossil penguin is a new species was also rewarding for the children of the Hamilton junior naturalist club, and will encourage other young people to connect with nature.Steffan Safey was 13 at the time of the discovery. “It’s sort of surreal to know that a discovery we made as kids so many years ago is contributing to academia today. And it’s a new species even,” Safey said.",2021-11-22
 Covid has made us use even more plastic – but we can resetChristian Dunn,"Lockdown has highlighted the versatility of this everyday material, while creating a mountain of waste",,"Every time you do a lateral flow coronavirus test, you throw away around 10g of plastic. If every adult and secondary school student in the UK did the recommended two tests a week, it would produce more than 1,000 tonnes of rubbish every seven days. In less than a month this would fill an Olympic-size swimming pool.Those of us who before the pandemic were involved in campaigns to cut our dependence on plastic, encouraging our communities to become “plastic free”, may feel like criticising such consumption. Should we stop these tests, knowing what we do about the plastic pollution crisis?Absolutely not. They are at the forefront of our ability to control the virus and help our country return to a form of normality. So too are the countless tonnes of plastic used in the development, production, transportation and delivery of the vaccine, not to mention all the single-use medical consumables essential to help those unfortunate enough to end up in hospital.Plastic has shown yet again what a wonderful, versatile and lifesaving product it can be. Without it, the pandemic would be going very differently. However, it is all too easy to forget this when stepping over the Covid cast-offs littering our streets. Single-use face masks, surgical gloves, tiny bottles of hand sanitiser and antiseptic wipes have become as common as cigarettes butts were a few years ago.An interesting aspect of all this is a recently identified phenomenon called “hygiene theatre”. That is, individuals and businesses that make sure they look like they’re fighting the pandemic, but perhaps not doing very much of real effect. From repeatedly incorrectly changing single-use face masks to the use of disposable laminated menus in restaurants and metre-high plastic dividers between tables in rowdy pubs, there has arguably been an abundance of this behaviour throughout the various stages of the pandemic. And as we now approach the great unlocking on 19 July, some measures and behavioural changes are likely to remain – not least our desire to be personally protected, and our increased dependence on takeaway food and online shopping, both great generators of plastic. But the question is, how can we achieve safety and convenience in our post-lockdown world in a more balanced way?The most visible symbol of the pandemic also presents us with an excellent case study for how necessary this rethinking is: face masks. A single-use disposable face mask can be 10 times more damaging to the climate than a reusable cotton one. Most of us, most of the time, when we’re nipping into shops do not need to use a disposable surgical-type face mask. Yet still 53m are being sent to landfill every day in the UK, which doesn’t cover all those that make up the bulk of Covid cast-offs on our streets.A significant proportion of people are using them because of our accepted cultural insistence on convenience, or perceived convenience. We think it’s easier to pick up a throwaway mask when we’re entering a shop than it is to remember our own, in the way it was once more convenient to use free plastic bags in a supermarket than remember our own. But shifting our reliance away from single-use plastic doesn’t have to mean the end of convenience – far from it. Instead it just means we need to move towards “considerate convenience”: giving a little more consideration to our actions, and being a bit more considerate towards each other and the planet.There have been reports of takeaway sales surging by up to 600% during lockdown. This, in turn, brings a mountain of single-use plastic to landfill. A great example of considerate convenience in this sector is the Shrewsbury Cup scheme, whereby the town’s cafes all using the same type of reusable take-out cup. Customers pay a deposit for the cup which can be returned to any of the businesses serving drinks. It’s then washed and reused. Yes, it may require a tiny bit more effort than just throwing a used cup in the bin, but it’s far better for the environment. The Shrewsbury Cup scheme is part of a wider move among increasingly environmentally conscious takeaway providers to find plastic-free ways of delivering food, including, for example, making deliveries in sturdy packaging customers can take away with them again.Little known too is that Amazon will reduce the plastic packaging used in your deliveries – but you have to contact customer services to ask for the option to be applied to your account. Hope is also provided by a growing amount of biodegradable plastic coming on to the market.The UK won’t meet its ambitious climate goals by making spending cuts | Larry ElliottRead moreImproving plastic recycling is another area that needs investment to ensure it’s both efficient and viable. Less than 10% of plastic is currently recycled and this is usually downgraded to poorer quality plastic. Alternatives to plastic need to be considered wherever possible. Moves are being made to make the polluter pay, which could see companies such as Coca Cola take responsibility for the plastic rubbish they produce. It’s also clear that the traditional take-make-waste model for our plastic use must be replaced with a more circular system – designing products and consumer processes differently.The pandemic has highlighted the good and the bad of plastic use, showing more clearly than ever that plastic consumption is all about balance. Wasteful use of virgin plastic turns our oceans into plastic soups. This was part of the message many of us were trying to get out before the pandemic hit. Now that we’re being urged to “build back better” as we come out of lockdown, let’s seize the opportunity to change our thinking about plastic. Let’s appreciate what a wonderful resource it can be – and crucially let’s realise that, like all resources, it must be used wisely and not wasted.

,"Looe Island is a case study in how to boost biodiversity, a place where the wardens, Claire Lewis and her partner, Jon Ross, are the only residents, alongside gulls, godwits and comma butterflies","['The age of extinction is supported by', 'About this content']","With its driftwood, capsized boat and crystal-clear waters, Looe Island looks more like a scene from Robinson Crusoe than the well-trodden coastline of Cornwall. Few realise that only a mile from Looe – a seaside town whose narrow streets spill over with tourists in the summer months – there is a wildlife sanctuary.In Cornwall’s only marine nature reserve, birds nest in thickets of trees, sheep graze grassy slopes and seals seek refuge in the island’s rocky bays. Quiet and tranquil, Looe Island is nearly deserted – apart from two wildlife wardens whose job it is to care for the land so its biodiversity flourishes.

Although the circumference of Looe Island, also known as St George’s Island, is only one mile, Looe has a long and varied history. Records indicate the island was an early Christian settlement, a tin trading centre and a hotspot for smuggling. In more recent years, it was inhabited by two sisters, who fulfilled a childhood dream of buying a private island.Babs and Evelyn Atkins secured the land in 1965 for £22,000, and retired there to write books about their remote island life. With no descendants, the sisters rejected a multimillion-pound offer to transform the island into a theme park, and bequeathed it to a charity, the Cornwall Wildlife Trust. Since 2004, Looe Island has been a nature reserve with the sole aim of letting wildlife thrive in peace.“We’ve tried to manage the land so that everything can go through its lifecycle, whether it’s an insect, flower or bird,” says Claire Lewis, who is the current caretaker of Looe Island along with her partner, Jon Ross. The couple, who are nature wardens for the trust, have been the island’s only residents for nearly 20 years. Their job involves monitoring species, reporting back to wildlife groups and hosting a limited number of visitors on the island.From Easter through to October, provided the tides are right, tourists can board an official boat from the mainland and take a self-guided trip around the island. Trespassing – by curious paddleboarders, swimmers and boaters – is forbidden.“It’s about minimising the impact on the island,” says Lewis. “The more people you have to stay longer, the more likely there will be disturbance.”

The island’s geography, a patchwork of woodland, maritime grassland, sand, shingle and rocky reef, has provided a natural refuge for wildlife. “One of the things you notice is how full of life it is,” Lewis says. And, at a time when biodiversity is in freefall – with reports suggesting half of the world’s bird species are in decline and flying insects have plunged by 64% since 2004 – Looe Island seems to be a pocket of resistance.We’ve tried to manage the land so everything can go through its complete lifecycle, whether insect, flower or birdClaire LewisLewis interrupts every so often to point out holly blue and comma butterflies, or to show off the island’s colony of great black-backed gulls, the largest in Cornwall, which can be found lounging on rocks or flexing their impressive 1.5-metre wingspan.

After almost two decades on the island, Lewis can differentiate easily between the calls and cadences of bird song – singling out oystercatchers, herring gulls, blackbirds, wrens or chaffinches like a conductor in an orchestra. Surrounded by natural sounds and smells, her senses have become fine-tuned.“We can tell if somebody has landed [on the island] because of the noises the birds make,” she says. “When people get off the boat, I can tell if someone’s washed their hair in strong shampoo or if they’re wearing a lot of deodorant.”Looe Island acts as a barometer, measuring the toll human activity has on wildlife. Away from the mainland’s chemical soup of sewage spills, pesticides and light pollution, nature is given space to breathe. “I think we’re far enough away for it to not have a huge impact, but we can’t control everything,” Lewis says.Compost is made from mostly natural resources, such as sheep manure and seaweed, and the island’s energy is from solar panels and wind turbines. More recently, visitors are being instructed to wash their shoes with disinfectant, to protect against avian flu spreading from the mainland.

Managing an island involves a delicate balance. Lewis says it is unlikely that species such as red squirrels would be deliberately brought over. “If we start introducing things we can’t easily control, it can shift everything out of balance,” she says. Their rule of thumb is: “This is what happens happily here, let’s not tinker with it too much.”There are a few exceptions – a flock of Shetland sheep was introduced to trim scrubby patches of land so cormorants could scour for prey, and Russian vine was removed because it was slowly suffocating the island’s apple, plum and walnut trees.

Still, a glance at the island’s vegetable garden gives a tropical impression, as the mild and sheltered habitat gives rise to crops such as yam and kiwi. The wardens grow most of their own fruit and vegetables, trading surplus runner beans or rhubarb for mackerel, fresh from the boats of passing fishers. The couple make do without most luxuries, though “we could do with a pub”, says Ross.By now, the wardens know the island like the back of their hands, but occasionally they are surprised. In 2013, Lewis spotted a translucent jellyfish with long, fine tentacles. It was a crystal jellyfish, a species rarely found in the UK, and usually seen in the warmer waters of the east Pacific. Sightings of unusual jellyfish, attributed to the climate crisis, are increasing, with 11 species spotted around the UK and Ireland in 2022, according to the Marine Conservation Society (MCS).

External groups and volunteers regularly visit the island to carry out bird ringing, nest counts, butterfly transects – when observers count numbers along a fixed path – and seal identification. Sue Sayer has been doing monthly surveys on the island with the Cornwall Seal Group Research Trust since 2008. “It’s a wonderful case study of how positive management can increase diversity,” she says. As an offshore and intertidal island, it is an important stopover for mobile seals – “like a service station on the seal motorway”, she says.Nest western: UK’s vulnerable kittiwakes flock to bird hotels Read moreThe island used to lie in “a sweet spot” for marine life, where warm currents mingled with cooler, nutrient-rich waters. But, says Lewis: “There does seem to be a shift, where warm water is getting further north. We can do our best here, but there may be other factors going on.”

For now, life remains largely unchanged on Looe Island. “Most of the time it’s peaceful. It’s good for anyone’s mental health to have that quiet,” says Lewis. “Island time” is punctuated by the rhythms of nature. “Yesterday, we saw our first sandwich terns of the spring. We’ll say ‘hello’ and then ‘goodbye, we’ll see you next year’,” she says.There is a comforting sense of continuity when acting as the guardian of a small island. “I like the idea that some of these birds could have been the same ones the sisters were looking at 20 years ago,” says Lewis.

"AnalysisWeather tracker: after Hurricane Nicole, more turbulence to hit Europe and AustraliaFaye Hulton (Metdesk)",Unsettled weather to continue across western Europe and southern Australia forecast to experience unseasonably cold spell,,"After causing devastation in Florida last week, Hurricane Nicole travelled along the east coast of the US and across the Atlantic towards western Europe as an extratropical cyclone. The remnants of Nicole brought heavy rain and strong winds to Ireland, the UK and parts of northern France during Monday night and Tuesday.Unsettled conditions are set to continue throughout the next few days across western Europe as several areas of low pressure move in from the Atlantic. These lows are expected to affect areas as far east as Norway and as far south as the Bay of Biscay, and will bring the potential of some localised flooding for the worst affected areas.Parts of Australia are also experiencing turbulent weather. Over the course of this past weekend (12-13 November), an active area of low pressure developed across South Australia and the Great Australian Bight. This system tracked south-eastwards along the coast, and was accompanied by a potent cold front that was responsible for the stormy conditions that developed across southern Australia. This event brought damaging winds, heavy rain, and flooding to parts of Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia – where 56mm of rain fell in Port Lincoln, and winds gusted to 106km/h at Adelaide airport.Although these wet and windy conditions have eased, as late spring approaches, a change in the synoptic setup will bring an unseasonable cold spell to southern and south-eastern Australia throughout the rest of this week. As the aforementioned low-pressure has travelled further east since the weekend, an area of high pressure started to take its place. This configuration has shifted the wind direction to a southerly flow, bringing in some cool Antarctic air, and has already started to allow temperatures to drop well below the seasonal norm across southern parts of the country.The coolest temperatures will be on Wednesday, with Melbourne and Adelaide experiencing maximum daytime temperatures over 9C below the seasonal norm, while temperatures in the Grampians may fall below zero overnight. Although temperatures are set to slowly rise during the latter part of the week, they will remain considerably below the seasonal average.",2022-11-14

","['Nina Lakhani', '@ninalakhani']","This piece first appeared in Down to Earth, the Guardian’s climate and environment newsletter. Sign up here to read more exclusive pieces like this and for a digest of the week’s biggest environment stories every ThursdayLast summer I packed my bags and left humid New York to spend a month reporting in the dry desert heat of Phoenix, Arizona. America’s fifth biggest city has always been hot, but day and night temperatures have been rising due to global heating and the city’s unchecked development, which has created a sprawling urban heat island that has literally become unliveable for some residents. In the past three years, 911 calls and emergency room visits for heat-related emergencies have skyrocketed and more than a thousand people have died from extreme heat. The city is scattered with cooling centres – air conditioned places where residents can go to cool down – but clearly this isn’t working for many people. I wanted to spend a good chunk of time in Phoenix to better understand why, and also who is most affected by the hotter days and nights.A very American death: how Caleb Blair lost his life in the Phoenix heatRead moreMy first week coincided with the season’s first extreme heatwave. Several daytime records were broken as the temperature hit 47C (116F) – very, very hot for early June – and for a week straight it never fell below 30C overnight. The impact of heat is cumulative and the body only begins to recover when temperatures drop below 27C.It was eerie driving around as there were so few people outside. In fact, it soon became clear that it was predominantly those with nowhere else to go, the unhoused, who were outside, desperately looking for shade in car parks, shop doorways, bus stops, parks and behind dumpsters. As Phoenix has gotten hotter, the number of unhoused people has also skyrocketed amid an affordable housing crisis and this has been a deadly combination: around a half of the city’s heat deaths are unhoused people. Another big risk factor is drugs. In Phoenix, fentanyl, a downer which can be 50 to 200 times more potent than morphine, and methamphetamine, an upper which increases the risk of heat-related medical complications, are frequently used in combination.I reported on unhoused people, folks struggling with addictions, community organisers, families that couldn’t afford air conditioning, firefighters (who are also paramedics) and the country’s first city-funded dedicated “heat team”. More than 400 people died from heat in 2022, but there was one story, an African American teenager called Caleb Blair, which got under my skin. And so I spent the next eight months trying to understand why a sweet talented kid with mental health struggles ended up naked and handcuffed, high and overheated, on the forecourt of a Circle K gas station.I tracked down his dad, Frank Blair, and spent hours and hours with him – which at the start mostly involved counselling work as he was verging on a breakdown (I was a mental health nurse for 10 years before journalism). Frank showed me hundreds of photos and videos of Caleb growing up, and explained how he’d tried to stop Caleb taking drugs but threw him out on his 18th birthday, hoping that the tough love would turn things around. The guilt he feels is immense. I interviewed his sister Kailani, who drove past the scene of Caleb’s death but had no idea that it was her brother on the ground. I spoke to his football and basketball coaches, reviewed hours of police body-camera and audio evidence, CCTV footage and autopsy reports obtained through freedom of information requests, spoke to medical experts and visited places where Caleb had lived and died.What I learned was that Caleb went into the Circle K asking to sit and cool down as he was hot and struggling to breath, but was told to leave as it was against company policy. He spent the next hour or so outside, where the air temperature was 44C and rising, but could have been as hot as 60C on the unshaded asphalt. His condition quickly deteriorated – he threw up, couldn’t breath easily, and became increasingly erratic which included banging his head on an employee’s car and taking his clothes off, probably trying to cool down. It was only then the employee and passersby called 911. When the cops showed up, he was naked, unarmed, erratic and verbally unresponsive, but he was treated like a threat and handcuffed. Within a few minutes he’d stopped breathing. The medical examiner found that Caleb’s death was caused by drug intoxication, meth and fentanyl, with extreme heat and pneumonia identified as contributing factors. A normal body temperature is around 36-37C. Caleb’s was 43C.His tragic death was preventable, but in some ways it was also inevitable given the US’s social, health and economic inequalities. And it signals that the climate crisis is a risk multiplier – it exposes, intersects with and amplifies existing problems such as housing shortages, inadequate mental health and addiction services, racist policing, and the lack of shade in cities, to name just a few.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

",['Peter Hannam'],"Australians could soon start to benefit from cheaper solar panels as a dive in raw material costs and a “boom” in global output delivers annual solar electricity price falls of 10% for the rest of the decade, according to a report by Climate Energy Finance.The Solar Pivot report by analysts Tim Buckley and Xuyang Dong said prices of polysilicon used to make the wafers in panels have fallen by two-thirds in 2023, sending panel prices down to US18c (A26.7c) a watt as of last month.Global installations of solar hit a record 268 gigawatts last year and could reach 1,000GW by 2030. “This would have profound implications for electricity and energy markets globally,” the report said.Renewable energy growth must double to meet Australia’s emission goals, Clean Energy Council saysRead more“CEF foresees the world could hit 1,000GW per annum of solar installs by 2030. This would have profound implications for electricity and energy markets globally.”Panel maker JinkoSolar last month announced plans for a US$7.9bn wafer-to-module solar factory in the Chinese province of Shanxi that alone will churn out as much as 56GW solar capacity a year. That scale is 19 times the biggest US plant – now being built - and compares with Australia’s total solar capacity of 30GW as 2022. Photograph: Climate Energy Finance/IEA Renewable Energy Market Update“The energy sector for decades has failed to invest in technology,” Buckley said. “Now the Chinese are spending unbelievable amounts of money.”The US, the European Union and India are among economies also ramping up investments in solar energy. The motivation is partly to decarbonise their energy systems and reduce dependence on Russia but also to counter China’s growing domination of renewable technologies, particularly solar.The Inflation Reduction Act, passed by the US Biden administration and which set aside $US369bn to bolster energy security and manufacturing, will drive a five-fold increase in yearly panel output to 40GW by 2024 and double solar installs to 40-50GW a year to 2030.By contrast, China is on track to have 12 solar manufacturing enterprises with annual module production capacity of 30GW each. It also will install 120-140GW of solar in 2023, doubling that to 260GW by 2030, the report said.Buckley said catching up with China if energy security was the goal was “a serious problem”.“They’re actually building market dominance with every year that goes by at the speed they’re moving,” he said, noting China’s share of global polysilicon output was already 75% in 2021 and will reach 90% by the end of this year.With all that expanded production capacity, “it’s an easy guess to say module prices will drop 30 or 40% by the end of this year versus where they were at 12-18 months ago,” Buckley said.Renate Egan, head of the Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics based at the University of New South Wales, said the report was “comprehensive and optimistic”, underscoring solar’s falling cost compared with energy sources, including coal. skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Similarly glass, aluminium and polymer components in modules could offer opportunities for Australia to focus on, Egan said.“There’s huge room for improvement in deployment and connection costs” for modules, she added. Photograph: Climate Energy Finance/ IEA Snapshot of Global PV Markets 2023Finn Peacock, founder of SolarQuotes, said China’s factory gate solar panels were 15% cheaper this year. Given the slightly weaker Australian dollar, “it seems reasonable that solar panel installers should soon see around a 10% decline in panel prices compared to the end of last year”, he said.Wholesale prices for “a good mid-range panel” are about $0.50/watt, excluding GST, from Australian warehouses. Countering much of the decline, though, will be another 13% reduction in the solar rebate from next January.At present, a 10kW rooftop system costs each household about $11,000. That price includes the rebate, now worth about $4,400, which will fall to $3,840 next year.Online solar inquiries have spiked in the wake of the latest news of higher electricity prices with interest over the king’s birthday weekend up 30% from a year earlier, Peacock said.",2023-06-14
 Injunction granted to stop Insulate Britain activists blocking port of Dover,Move follows arrest of 39 climate protesters who sat down on roads in and out of the port on Friday,['Matthew Taylor'],"The high court has granted an interim injunction preventing protesters from occupying roads around Britain’s busiest port.It comes after Kent police arrested 39 people when activists with Insulate Britain – an offshoot of climate change group Extinction Rebellion – sat down on roads in and out of the Port of Dover at about 8.20am on Friday.The demonstration, part of an ongoing campaign to tackle fuel poverty and reduce the UK’s climate emissions, created long queues of vehicles, with several drivers remonstrating with the activists.Transport secretary Grant Shapps said: “We are absolutely committed to protecting the right to peaceful protest, but it is unacceptable that people cannot go about their day-to-day businesses and that businesses or critical supplies should be put on a knife’s edge because of the reckless actions of a few protesters.”Those who breach the injunction, granted to National Highways, will be in contempt of court and at risk of imprisonment and an unlimited fine, the government said.The protest group – which is demanding that all UK housing is fully insulated by 2030 – have brought widespread disruption since its launch 10 days ago, with activists repeatedly blocking sections of the M25.They have been condemned as selfish and dangerous by politicians and drawn an angry reaction from many motorists.Earlier this week, the government successfully applied to the high court for an order that prohibits anyone from blocking the M25 – the scene of previous protests by the group. Anyone who breaks the injunction could be found to be in contempt of court, which carries a maximum penalty of two years in prison or an unlimited fine.However, a spokesperson for the protesters said that injunction did not apply to the protests in Dover.In a statement, the group added: “We are sorry for the disruption that we are causing. It seems to be the only way to keep the issue of insulation on the agenda and to draw attention to how poorly insulated homes are causing ill-health, misery and early death for many thousands of people.“We are failing the country’s cold hungry families and the elderly and placing an enormous burden on the NHS.”One lane of the A20 remained blocked on Friday afternoon with two protesters on top of a tanker, reportedly glued to the vehicle. One activist, who gave her name as Stephanie, said: “We do not want to be here. I want to be home with my family spending time with them, but if we don’t do this they aren’t going to have a future.”Senior Conservative politicians have criticised the group, saying they are putting themselves and members of the public in danger. Shapps said: “Invading a motorway is reckless and puts lives at risk.”The protesters have vowed to continue their campaign, which they say highlights the urgent need to improve the UK’s poor housing stock, rated as some of the worst in Europe, to tackle carbon emissions, fuel poverty and public health.A spokesperson for the group said: “Insulating our leaky homes is one of the most cost-effective ways to reduce carbon emissions and it has all these additional benefits – reducing fuel poverty, creating jobs, reducing the burden on the NHS and protecting people from overheating during future heatwaves. It’s a no-brainer. Boris just needs to get on with the job.”A government spokesperson said peaceful protest was “a cornerstone of our democracy” but criticised Friday’s action saying it had “put lives at risk”.“The demonstrations we have seen over the last few weeks have wreaked havoc on our roads, disrupted thousands of people and put lives in danger and we are taking action to prevent these kinds of guerrilla tactics being used in the future,” they added.",
ExplainerWhy are UK supermarkets facing fresh food shortages?,"Three big retailers are placing limits on shoppers on some produce lines. What is behind the rationing?
 Aldi joins rivals Asda and Morrisons in rationing salad ingredients","['Joanna Partridge', ' and ', 'Sarah Butler']","Three of the UK’s largest supermarket chains have introduced limits for shoppers on several fresh produce lines, including tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers, as they try to prevent gaps appearing on shelves.So what is going on and are the shortages going to spread to other retailers and foodstuffs?How big is the problem?Morrisons has announced limits of two an item on packs of tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce and peppers, while Asda is restricting shoppers to three items each on eight fresh produce lines – including broccoli, cauliflower, raspberries and lettuces.On Wednesday, Tesco and Aldi joined them, each limiting purchases of peppers, cucumbers and tomatoes to three packs a person.Other supermarkets are yet to introduce rationing, but grocery retailers have said shortages could last for some weeks.What is behind the shortages?Certain fresh vegetables and fruits are hard to come by in the UK as a result of an unfortunate combination of poor weather reducing the harvest in Europe and north Africa, as well lower supplies from UK and Dutch producers hit by the jump in energy bills to heat glasshouses.Aldi joins rivals Asda and Morrisons in rationing salad ingredientsRead moreAt this time of year, Britain relies on Spain, Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt for the bulk of salad imports. However, these crops have been affected by unusually cold weather last month, including intense night frosts, while tomato plants have also been damaged or killed by disease – in particular the tomato brown rugose virus.Meanwhile, Britain and other northern European countries – particularly the Netherlands which is a big vegetable producer – have reduced how many crops they have planted over the winter,  after the Ukraine war sent bills soaring for the energy required to light and heat greenhouses and the cost of the fertiliser used on plants.Faced with higher costs for glasshouse crops, some retailers chose to rely more heavily this year on sourcing from Spain and north Africa, leaving them more vulnerable to the weather-triggered shortages.Are things worse in the UK than the rest of Europe?It seems so. There are no reports of shortages in France and Germany and European shoppers have shared photos on social media of full supermarket shelves, in stark contrast to British supermarkets.One issue is reduced output from British farms. The president of the National Farmers’ Union (NFU), Minette Batters, told the union’s annual conference on Tuesday that “domestic production of salad, including cucumbers and tomatoes, has fallen to its lowest level since records began in 1985”.In the UK, a cold snap and frost before Christmas also damaged field crops including cauliflower, cabbage and carrots.Batters has warned there might be further rationing of salad items to come, especially if growers’ energy bills remain high.With many British tomato and salad growers having chosen to delaying planting in recent months because of economic uncertainty, UK production will not be able to pick up the slack for several weeks, and will probably begin later than in a normal year.As a result, demand for Spanish and Moroccan produce to fill the gap has outstripped supply, and retailers cannot access as much food as they need, or face paying significantly higher prices for what is available.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.after newsletter promotionSo is Brexit to blame?Most farmers and suppliers have said they do not believe the UK’s exit from the EU is the main reason for the UK’s empty supermarket shelves. However, many acknowledge that Brexit – as well as the pandemic – have increased costs for growers, mostly as a result of having to pay higher wages to workers amid labour shortages.Some importers argue the additional costs and bureaucracy created by Brexit have put the UK at the back of queue for supplies from European producers when crops are in short supply across the continent. It has also led to higher costs and paperwork, which can cause delays at the border – a particular issue with perishable produce.What other food stuffs might run short?Salad crops including cucumbers, tomatoes and lettuce are now most affected. Supplies of aubergines and lemons have also been hit, as have field crops in Spain including broccoli and lettuce. In the UK, frost has damaged production of brassicas, especially cabbage and cauliflower.However, eggs are also undergoing shortages, after producers were hit by rising costs and the UK’s worst-ever outbreak of avian influenza. This requires all birds in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but not in Scotland, to be kept indoors, pushing up already soaring heating and lighting costs for egg producers.The NFU calculates that UK egg production has fallen to its lowest level in nine years, while UK egg packers packed almost 1bn fewer eggs in 2022 than they did in 2019.Sainsbury’s has been importing eggs from Italy since late last year as a result of shortages in British supply.What could be done to help the situation?The NFU is calling for more support to energy-reliant British farmers. At its annual conference, Batters criticised government policy, pointing out that botanical gardens with large glasshouses have received support with their energy bills through the energy relief scheme, while food producers with greenhouses have not.The farming minister, Mark Spencer, told the conference that the Treasury and the government’s business department were examining these schemes.Yet, even as wholesale prices for salad crops surge, growers will not necessarily be able to earn more for their produce, as they are often tied into contracts with retailers and suppliers.Some UK growers have criticised British retailers for wanting to sell food at too low a price, often below the cost of production. However, supermarkets are reluctant to raise prices as they do not want to lose customers to their rivals during the cost of living crisis.",
 Nicola Sturgeon and Sadiq Khan call on Liz Truss to freeze energy prices,"Scottish first minister and London mayor urge new PM to address cost of living crisis with emergency package

Politics live – latest updates
","['Severin Carrell', ' Scotland editor', '@severincarrell']","Scotland’s first minister and the mayor of London have urged Liz Truss to freeze energy prices immediately, as part of a package of emergency measures to address the cost of living crisis.Nicola Sturgeon and Sadiq Khan said the incoming UK prime minister had to increase funding for public services and urgently increase financial support for those in greatest need.Mark Drakeford, the first minister of Wales, said: “We now need to work together, with urgency, to tackle the cost of living crisis, and save millions from hardship this winter.

U-turn on everything she believes in | Simon JenkinsRead moreBefore her election, Truss was widely criticised after telling Tory members Sturgeon was an “attention seeker” who should be ignored. Truss later indicated she was referring to the first minister’s calls for a second Scottish independence vote, and insisted she also wanted constructive relations with Edinburgh.Truss had also attacked Drakeford during the leadership campaign, calling him a “low energy” Jeremy Corbyn. Speaking on the BBC News channel, Drakeford brushed that off, saying such jibes “do not matter to families throughout Wales who live in fear of what this winter might bring to them”.Michelle O’Neill, the Sinn Féin leader at Stormont and Northern Ireland’s first minister in waiting, urged Truss to drop her plans to appease unionists by rewriting the Northern Ireland protocol – a move that threatens to wreck the Good Friday agreement that introduced power sharing.During the leadership campaign, Truss suggested she would rewrite the protocol to placate the Democratic Unionist party, which has refused to rejoin the executive while the protocol remains in its present form.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Country diary: The first cuckoo of the year prompts a lively family tradition,"Caradon Hill, Bodmin Moor: On this cool and hazy May morning, the turf flushes pale green and birds sing from leafy thickets",['Virginia Spiers'],"Below Caradon Hill, the fresh, diaphanous leaves of tall beeches hide Tokenbury Manor, and a green panorama extends across the Lynher Valley towards Kit Hill (near home) and beyond, to the skyline of misty Dartmoor.Patches of sunlight gleam across this predominantly pastoral land with rare enclaves of lurid oilseed rape, and fewer fields of plastic-covered maize than in previous years. Lambs and their attendant ewes scatter across the hill’s stony rough grazing; bracken emerges through last year’s flattened brown fronds, and turf flushes pale green. Gnarled gorse trees dazzle with yellow flowers and lichen-draped thorns will soon burst into bloom.Encircling the hill, a path follows an old railway, part of a sinuous network that, in the 19th century, carried ore and granite downhill towards Moorswater near Liskeard and then onwards by canal, superseded by a railway, to Looe harbour. On this cool, hazy May morning, a cuckoo – the first of the year – sounds from higher up the open hill; following family tradition we run about to ensure another year of liveliness!Then, around a bend, we hear that rare call again, carrying uphill from the overgrown Marke Valley (once intensively mined and linked to this railway); northwards is the wooded top of outlying Notter Tor and the stark rocks of Sharp Tor. Then comes the village of Minions (almost 1,000ft above sea level) set in this world heritage mining landscape, close to the prehistoric stone circles of the Hurlers and overlooked by the Cheesewring.Southward, granite sleepers, once fixed with rails, mark the way into Gonamena Valley; on either side of the little stream (source of the River Seaton) are tower dumps of waste, excavated from South Caradon mine, producing copper ore until closure in 1885 – no sound or sight now of the clanking machinery, steam engines and crowds of surface workers breaking and washing the ore.Birds sing within leafy thickets of willow, thorn and brilliant gorse growing across the hummocky bottom. Ruinous chimneys and engine houses protrude through regenerating trees and, from the canopy of oak catkins, comes the mellifluous song of willow warblers.

 US fails to give money promised for developing countries to ease climate impacts,Spending bill passed by Senate includes less than $1bn in climate assistance for poorer nations even though Biden promised $11.4bn,"['Oliver Milman', '@olliemilman']","The US has risked alienating developing countries hit hardest by the climate crisis, after Congress delivered just a fraction of the money promised by Joe Biden to help poorer nations adapt to worsening storms, floods and droughts.Biden has promised $11.4bn each year for developing countries to ease climate impacts and help them shift to renewable energy but the vast $1.7tn spending bill to keep the US government running, passed by the Senate on Thursday, includes less than $1bn in climate assistance for these countries.The bill, which is expected to pass the House and be signed by the president, includes $270m for adaptation programs, largely for countries in Asia and the Pacific islands, along with $260m in clean energy investment, aimed at Africa. Another $185m will go on “sustainable landscapes programs”.The failure to so far meet Biden’s pledge risks undermining the White House’s insistence that the US is committed to helping deal with the fallout of a climate crisis that it is a leading instigator of, through its huge historical and ongoing greenhouse gas emissions. Developing countries will need anything from $340bn to $2tn a year by 2030, according to various studies, to cope with the cascading impacts of global heating.Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development, based in Bangladesh, said that the US’ fair share of climate aid is far beyond even what Biden promised. “So one billion is really an insult to the developing countries,” he said. “The paltry allocation of only $1bn to support the developing countries is extremely disappointing.”US environmental groups have welcomed elements of the spending bill, including a large increase in the budgets of the Environmental Protection Agency and department of interior, as well as $600m for water infrastructure in Jackson, Mississippi, but criticized the glaring lack of climate aid.“Funding levels for international climate aid are woefully inadequate to meet our global commitments or do our fair share to support under-resourced countries bearing the brunt of climate impacts,” said Sara Chieffo, vice-president of government affairs at the League of Conservation Voters.Biden’s administration had made the climate spending a priority, with John Kerry, the US’s climate envoy, dispatched to lobby lawmakers. Both Biden and Kerry attended the UN Cop27 climate talks in Egypt last month and vowed the US would step up its assistance. “The climate crisis is hitting hardest those countries and communities that have the fewest resources to respond and to recover,” Biden noted in his speech to delegates at the summit, repeating his promise to extract the required money from Congress.Administration officials say the goal is to deliver the assistance by 2024 and that money could come from other sources than direct appropriations from Congress. But the likelihood of doing this becomes far more remote once Republicans, who have largely rejected the idea of providing further aid for climate damages, gain control of the House of Representatives in January.A White House spokeswoman said that the $11bn target is “a top priority for us and critical to the success of president Biden’s climate agenda. And the president has made clear that he is going to fight to see this fully funded.“Over the past several weeks and throughout the past weekend, members of the administration worked to secure funding in (financial year) 2023 that puts us on a path to achieving this goal. We will continue to work with Congress to make achieving this goal in (financial year) 2024 a reality.”",2023-01-05
 This article is more than 3 months oldWorld’s dogs going vegan ‘would save more emissions than UK produces’This article is more than 3 months old,Study estimates cats and dogs consume about 9% of all land animals killed for food,"['Rachel Hall', '@rachela_hall']","If all the world’s dogs went vegan it would save more greenhouse gas emissions than those produced by the UK, according to research advocating the environmental benefits of plant-based pets.The study estimated cats and dogs consume about 9% of all land animals killed for food – about 7 billion animals annually – as well as billions of fish and aquatic animals. Plant-based diets lower greenhouse gas emissions and require less land and water.The research at the University of Winchester calculated that if all the world’s dogs went vegan, it would free up a larger land mass than Mexico and more freshwater than all the renewable freshwater in Denmark, and would feed about 450 million additional people – more than the entire EU population.If all the world’s cats went vegan, it would save more emissions than those produced by New Zealand, land larger than Germany, freshwater exceeding all renewable freshwater in Jordan, and would feed about 70 million additional people – more than the entire UK population, according to the study published in the Plos One scientific journal.Prof Andrew Knight, the veterinary academic who led the study, said that many pet owners were unaware of the “profound environmental impacts” caused by their animals’ food.“Pet owners who care about the environment or their animals’ health should consider nutritionally sound vegan pet food,” he said.He noted that large scale studies had already shown that dogs and cats can be just as healthy, or even more, on a vegan diet, so long as they eat pet food that is specially formulated with additional vitamins, amino acids and minerals to ensure it is nutritionally sound.“Studies of feeding behaviour have demonstrated that average dogs and cats enjoy vegan pet foods as much as those made from meat,” he added.Cats may get health benefits from vegan diet, study suggestsRead moreUntil recently it was difficult for cats and dogs to follow a plant-based diet, however vegan pet food has developed in recent years, with the vegan dog food market valued at £11.5bn in 2023, and projected to reach £21bn by 2033.Knight’s calculations also demonstrated that if all the world’s people went vegan, it would save more greenhouse gases than all those emitted by the entire EU, land larger than Russia and India combined, renewable freshwater exceeding all that of Cuba, and would feed about 5.3 billion additional people – almost two-thirds of the world’s current population.The British Veterinary Association and Blue Cross have previously advised against feeding animals a vegan diet as it can be difficult to get the balance of nutrients right, leading to a risk of dietary deficiencies and associated disease. They recommend that anyone considering a vegan diet for their pet should consult their vet first.",2023-10-04
 Water firms resist government calls for more hosepipe bans,Just two companies have banned use as firms in drier areas wait until last minute to avoid annoying customers,"['Helena Horton', ' Environment reporter']","Water companies are in a standoff with the government over hosepipe bans as they resist bringing in restrictions despite growing concerns about rivers running dry and the prospect of drought in England and Wales.The decision to restrict water usage is made by individual water companies, which are advised by the government and charities as part of the National Drought Group.Government sources said they have urged more water companies to implement a ban on excessive water use, such as hosepipes for gardening and washing the car, as well as filling paddling pools.Last month was the driest July in England for more than 100 years and some areas have had their driest summer on record.Two water companies – Southern Water and South East Water – have announced hosepipe bans for millions of customers, with Thames Water and Welsh Water warning restrictions could be imposed.South East Water said on Wednesday that it had “no choice” but to restrict water use for 3 million households from 12 August, citing demand this summer breaking “all previous records” during extremely dry conditions.But other companies, even in drier areas, have held firm. Those involved in drought discussions say companies would rather wait until the last minute, when rivers are running dry, rather than irritate customers by putting bans in place early.GraphicMark Lloyd, the chief executive of the Rivers Trust, said: “I made the point at the National Drought Group that every year we get to this position and at the last possible limit, when the rivers are at their lowest, we get discussion of temporary use bans.”He said the situation can be made worse before it gets better because, when people fear an impending ban, many rush to use water and put extra stress on the system.“Announcing it at the last minute also causes everyone to rush to wash their cars and fill their paddling pools, wash the dog, and causes an increase in demand before the ban comes in,” he said.“This should happen before the rivers come to a desperate condition and there’s not enough water for wildlife.”A fear of a customer backlash could be preventing companies from acting, he said. “It is unpopular – gardeners complain – and there’s an issue of trust as well – people are pointing out there’s a lot of leakage from water company pipes and people say: ‘Well, you fix your leaks and I’ll stop using my hosepipe,’” Lloyd added.“There is a breakdown of trust between the public and the water companies, particularly with the sewage spills and everything.”Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BSTIn East Anglia, the driest part of the country, it has barely rained all summer, the ground receiving just 4% of the average rainfall in July. Anglian Water has ruled out a hosepipe ban, despite locals pointing out that rivers in the area have dried up.Thames Water, which covers London, Oxford and the surrounding area, has admitted that at times demand for water has outstripped the pace at which it can be treated and pumped into taps, and that dry conditions have threatened supply.Despite saying a ban is being considered, there are no plans to put one in place this month.An Environment Agency spokesperson said: “The Environment Agency is working with water companies and other abstractors to protect water resources and ensure they take precautionary action so the needs of water users and the environment are met.“Water companies are also putting their drought plans in place where needed to maintain water supply, but everyone can play their part to use water wisely.“South East Water’s announcement of a temporary use ban for its customers in Kent, East Sussex and West Sussex is one of many measures they and other water companies should consider to reduce unnecessary water use, and protect customer supplies and the environment.”A government spokesperson said: “Water companies have a statutory duty to ensure adequate supplies and have a range of tools available to them to deliver that. This includes hosepipe bans, which it is up to the local water company to decide whether to deploy.“The government is continuing to work closely with water companies and the Environment Agency to take any other precautionary steps needed to protect public supplies, the environment and critical sectors that depend on water, including farmers. All water companies have confirmed that there are no current risks to essential water supplies but we will continue to closely monitor the situation.”",2022-08-04
 Show Me the Honey: amateur beekeepers to compete in BBC show,Exclusive: seven-part TV series will involve weekly challenges and aims to tap into rising interest in apiaries,['Tara Conlan'],"It has made The Great British Sewing Bee and spelling bee series Hard Spell but now the BBC is focusing on actual bees – by launching the UK’s first competitive beekeeping TV show.Show Me the Honey! features five children and their families taking part in a series of weekly challenges to create the best hive and tastiest honey, with the winner taking home the beekeeper of the year trophy.During the seven-part series, the novice beekeeping families learn about their charges in bee school and try to earn the weekly golden bee prize.ProfileBoomtime for craft reality showsShowFrom portraiture to pottery, craft reality shows have become a staple of British television programming in recent years. And following a surge of interest in arts and crafts prompted by the pandemic, broadcasters are banking on the genre with a raft of new seasons. • Portrait Artist of the Year, on Sky Arts, opens its eighth series next month since launching in 2013. The show, presented by Stephen Mangan and Joan Bakewell, searches for a new star portrait artist by asking them to paint different famous people with their work judged by  artist Tai Shan Schierenberg, curator Kathleen Soriano and art historian Kate Bryan.  Subjects confirmed to take part include Mercury prize-nominated musician Celeste, creative director Alexa Chung and Alastair Campbell. The winning artist will get £10,000 and a commission to paint violinist Nicola Benedetti for an exhibition at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. • The Great British Bake Off returns to Channel 4 for a 12th series on 21 September. This year’s contestants on the show – presented by Paul Hollywood, Prue Leith, Matt Lucas and Noel Fielding – include a police detective, retired midwife and a psychology student. • Earlier this month, C4 announced it had commissioned a new show, The Great Big Tiny Design Challenge presented by Sandi Toksvig, in which participants will compete to create the best doll-sized home. The eight-part series for More 4 will be judged by design expert Laura Jackson and world-record holding miniature sculptor Willard Wigan. • And then there’s pottery. The Great Pottery Throw Down, presented by Derry Girls actor Siobhán McSweeney, in which 12 amateur potters compete to be named champion of the wheel, was a hit on C4 earlier this year after being cancelled by the BBC in 2018.  Other craft reality shows include the BBC’s Great British Sewing Bee, presented by Joe Lycett, and HBO series Full Bloom, broadcast in the UK on More 4, where florists compete to win $100,000.Miranda Bryant Photograph: Mark Bourdillon/Love ProductionsWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.With the appetite for apiaries on the rise as people try to tackle the climate crisis by reversing the decline in bees, Show Me the Honey! taps into the buzz around beekeeping and gives viewers tips on how to help all pollinating insects.One of the judges on the show is the chef Ainsley Harriott, who makes a dish from the winning honey.He said: “We all love to eat honey but Show Me the Honey! gives us all an incredible insight into how it’s produced, what it takes to look after a hive, the amazing role bees play in the food chain and just how important they are for the environment.”Presenter Maddie Moate, who got into beekeeping by helping her mother during university holidays, said the show is a “wonderful … way into the subject [of the environment] that feels hopeful.“After the release of the first Blue Planet, plastic pollution became an entry into the subject a way of talking about the problems going on with the ocean and environment on a larger scale. I think bees do a very similar thing when it comes to biodiversity and the way we’re managing land.”The Bafta award-winning presenter added: “Yes there’s an overall winner of the show but in each episode we include little challenges such as creating a pollen paradise to make your garden bee-friendly or how to make a bee hotel. Even putting a couple of flowers on a windowsill helps bees to get from one large wildflower meadow to another because they need these little stop-offs – like diners or service stations – to get them from A to B.”Presenter Maddie Moate with professional beekeeper Curtis Thompson. Photograph: CBBCDespite the trend for bucolic broadcasting, as seen by the success of Amazon’s Clarkson’s Farm and Channel 5’s Our Yorkshire Farm, Moate thinks nobody has made a programme like Show Me the Honey! before due to the innate challenges of beekeeping.She has never been stung during her 15 years of beekeeping but acknowledged: “There are lots of things that can go wrong and are out of our control, which might explain why this hasn’t been done before.”Despite that, and thanks to safety measures such as beekeeping suits, only two contributors and a dog were stung during the four months of filming.With the number of beehives in London more than doubling over a decade to an estimated 7,400 and membership of the British Beekeepers Association at 25,000, there is a thriving UK “beeconomy” with ventures such as Beevive’s bee-reviving keyring and Selfridges’ new honey-based restaurant Hive.The BBC show’s contestants are assisted by professional beekeeper Curtis Thompson, who left his investment banking job to set up bee-based business Local Honey Man. He became interested in the environment and insects through his uncle and realised “there was space for an innovative honey producer”.Thompson said: “Everyone now is a lot more conscious about the environment and wants to help, so what better way than starting with the pollinators that are responsible for so many of our food crops? It also makes for a great hobby; it’s a real de-stresser.”Although Show Me the Honey! has been made for CBBC it will air on iPlayer and Thompson thinks a grown-up or celebrity spin-off could work: “There’s a lot of demand and interest in bees so why not do an adult version,” he said.Show Me the Honey! will air on CBBC on 30 September",2018-04-15
 Rishi Sunak’s U-turn on windfarms reflects the Tories’ failure to protect rural EnglandSimon Jenkins,"As the Conservatives squabble over planning and housing targets, England’s countryside is being destroyed",,"The English countryside is sick. It can feel as though a day never passes without its green and pleasant land falling victim to the threat of windfarms, coalmines, solar arrays and housing estates. Boris Johnson seemed to want a turbine in every field. Liz Truss wanted “investment zones” even in protected areas. Rishi Sunak called for 300,000 new houses a year – until he didn’t.This week the new environment secretary, Thérèse Coffey, could not enlighten a Commons committee on her policy for farms, given the shambles of Brexit. Meanwhile, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, found himself capitulating to onshore windfarms one minute and a coalmine in Whitehaven the next. As for Labour’s Keir Starmer, he savaged Sunak for abandoning housing targets the same week as he said he would stop telling local councils what to do.The root trouble is that the English countryside is not a renewable resource. Until the end of the last century there was a general presumption that “the country” was exclusively for farming, leisure and natural beauty. The creation of town and country planning was a much-vaunted reaction to inter-war sprawl.Until recently, areas of acknowledged “natural beauty” were relatively safe. Not any more. According to their champion, the CPRE, every year since 2017-18 England has seen an average of 1,670 housing units approved in Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs) – representing an annual loss of 119 hectares of supposedly protected landscape. Development in the Cotswolds AONB, mostly of “executive homes”, has tripled in the past five years.The vernacular growth of existing settlements that might be encouraged in France and Germany becomes in England a characterless splatter of pattern-book estates dumped in fields under the diktat of Whitehall inspectors. One consequence is the Natural History Museum declaring Britain “one of the most nature-depleted countries in Europe”, with 40m birds apparently vanishing from its skies since 1970.As a result, a recent Ipsos poll showed 57% of people felt giving priority to “the views of local residents or protecting the countryside” should take precedence over meeting housing targets, with only a quarter believing housing numbers were the only priority. Yet public policy works in the opposite direction. There is no minister for the countryside, only for activities that wreck it. Lobbying for new houses is developer-led, with builders among the Tory party’s most generous donors. They crave open fields. All stories about a “housing crisis” are illustrated by new buildings. This is despite the fact that in 2020, new builds comprised a mere 7% of housing transactions in England.Britain is among the most extravagant users of housing land in Europe. London has just a quarter the population density of Paris, which is why it sprawls ever outwards. A sensible housing policy would concentrate on correcting low densities and inefficient occupation, not least the thousands of empty properties. Meanwhile developer pressure has kept new buildings free of VAT, while it is levied in full on conversions or retrofitting. This discourages housing economy and sustainability. Likewise stamp duty is a disincentive to the most urgent need, which is for older people to downsize. Britain’s housing policy is distorted and corrupted, building houses for the rich and ignoring the poor.The result is constant pressure to invade a now virtually defenceless countryside. In his previous incarnation at agriculture, the present planning secretary, Michael Gove, proposed a thoughtful replacement for the EU’s common agricultural policy (CAP). His “environmental land management scheme” (Elms) shifted the emphasis of subsidy away from food production towards “public goods”, encouraging farmers to guard landscape and nature, grow hedges and forests, promote wildlife and nurture public awareness. A year of Downing Street shambles blew that good sense out of the water. Coffey this week hinted that things may as well remain as they were under the CAP’s “stewardship” subsidies. Another recipe for chaos.There now marches over the horizon the Community Planning Alliance, with 500 local groups around the UK. It is part of a fierce reaction to Whitehall’s housing targets for local councils. Tory MPs said enough was enough, and Sunak was terrified into capitulation: targets are now merely “advisory”. It is ironic that at the very same time Sunak was caving in to an opposing lobby, that of other MPs wanting more wind turbines defacing the countryside, albeit “where local people agree”.What is clear is that Britain has no way of defining and deciding which parts of the countryside should qualify for permanent protection and which can be open to varying degrees of development. In towns and cities, listed buildings and conservation areas are protected. Heritage is valued. Built-up historic Britain is probably safe for ever.The same is not true of “historic” landscape. At least outside national parks, none is “listed”. AONBs, nature reserves, green belts, river valleys and pleasant stretches of fields and trees are ever more vulnerable to speculative developers. They buy land and gamble on a susceptible local council or change in government policy. Just as meadows were once sacrificed to out-of-town petrol stations and supermarkets – half of them now obsolete – so they are now vulnerable to the latest transient but irreversible intrusion.The only solution is zoning, to declare stretches of countryside as inviolable, and others as safe from any but the most critical usage. Plenty of developable land would be left, both “green” and “brown”. For the most part, housebuilding should be confined within towns and cities, sustainable, “densifying” existing sites and using existing infrastructure. Rural Britain would be consigned to properly valuing what survives of its natural appearance, a legacy for future generations.

 Cop26: welcome to Glasgow – the world is watchingPhoebe Weston,"Now most countries have experienced the climate crisis as wildfires, floods or heatwaves,  leaders know they must deliver","['The age of extinction is supported by', 'About this content']","For a conference that had already been delayed by a year, perhaps this was a fitting start for the delegates and world leaders who made their way to Cop26 with a mission to save the planet.It was raining. There was no shelter. And the thousands of participants who had come to the UK from all four corners of the globe faced the mother of all queues to get inside.Welcome to Glasgow.This was not the most promising start for a conference seen by most observers as a last chance to save the world from climate change. But perhaps the wind and grey would help to focus minds on the task at hand.What is Cop26 and why does it matter? The complete guide Read moreAfter all, the stakes have never been higher. The political leaders here all know that they’re on the hook.In the past they may have quibbled over the science, or questioned the figures. But this was a year in which the climate crisis came into more people’s lives than ever before. Many of their countries experienced record temperatures, wildfires, droughts and floods.Outside the conference, the demonstrators who chanted and sang were a constant reminder that there is a generation of people with a much clearer sense of what is going on – and a willingness to blame those who fail to assume responsibility and sort it out.In the pavilion, a makeshift village near the entrance to the site where NGOs, countries and corporations have set up pitches, there was a lifesize model of polar bears stuck on ice at the Tuvalu stand, and a sculpture of a penguin hanging itself. On every stand people were eager to talk and communicate the urgency they all felt.But it was in the blue zone, right at the centre of the conference, where the proper meetings would take place. And here, beyond the protesters and the queues and the polar bears, past the crowds of delegates with lanyards and briefcases, deep in the heart of the conference there was an undeniable sense of purpose as the leaders began their speeches and things finally got under way.Cop26 kicks off in Glasgow – in picturesRead moreWhat most of them would have made of Boris Johnson’s address is anyone’s guess. The host of the event, the ringmaster of this diplomatic circus, the UK prime minister started his speech talking about the city’s most famous fictional son: James Bond, likening the situation facing the world to a ticking timebomb.“We might not feel like James Bond, or look like James Bond, but Cop26 must be the start of defusing that bomb. Yes, it is going to be hard, but yes, we can do it,” he said.It was a step up, perhaps, from the speech he gave to the UN general assembly a month ago, in which he referenced the Muppets’ character, Kermit the Frog.It was the prime minister of Barbados, Mia Amor Mottley, who better captured the sense of urgency.She accused countries of making promises based on technology that still doesn’t exist. “This is at best reckless and at worst dangerous,” she said.“Our people are watching, and our people are taking note. And are we really going to leave Scotland without the resolve and the ambition that is sorely needed to save lives and to save our planet?”The UN secretary general, António Guterres, was emphatic too.“We are digging our own graves,” he said, as he urged G20 countries responsible for 80% of emissions to return to Cop every year with new commitments, rather than every five years as before.He also spoke about the importance of reaching the $100bn a year target promised in Paris in 2015.And he reminded those listening about the children, the next generation, who were watching. “The climate action army – led by young people – is unstoppable. They are larger. They are louder. And, I assure you, they are not going away,” he said.Once again, it was the veteran broadcaster, Sir David Attenborough, who somehow found the words that got delegates out of their seats.He told the conference that humans were the “greatest problem solvers to have ever existed on Earth”, and it not beyond the wit of man to “turn this tragedy into a triumph”.“We now understand this problem, we know how to stop the number rising and put it in reverse,” he said.Some of the most desperate calls for help came from poorer countries, many of whom have populations most at risk from escalating temperatures.Sonam Phuntsho Wangdi, from the Kingdom of Bhutan, who is chair of the least developed countries group at UN climate change negotiations, which represents the world’s poorest 48 nations, said “words alone are not enough”.“We cannot leave Glasgow without strong commitments that will ensure the survival of the billion people living in the [least developed countries].”Young Kenyan activist Elizabeth Wathuti closed this part of the ceremony. “I have seen with my own eyes three young children crying at the side of a dried-up river after walking 12 miles with their mother to find water,” she said.President Biden was one of a few delegates who appeared to nod off as the speeches went on. He showed up late after flying into Edinburgh earlier in the day and being driven to Glasgow in a motorcade.At least he got there, unlike veteran correspondent Wolf Blitzer from CNN who was sent to Edinburgh to report on the conference.“Should’ve gone to Glasgow,” said Specsavers’ Twitter account.",2021-11-02
 Kenya declares war on millions of birds after they raid crops,"Toxic pesticides used to eradicate grain-eating quelea may harm the country’s endangered raptors, say conservationists","['The age of extinction is supported by', 'About this content', 'Peter Muiruri', ' in Nairobi']","A drive by the Kenyan government to kill up to 6 million red-billed quelea birds that have invaded farms will have unintended consequences for raptors and other wild species, experts have warned.The continuing drought in the Horn of Africa has reduced the amount of native grass, whose seeds are queleas’ main food source, causing the birds to increasingly invade grain fields, putting 2,000 acres (800 hectares) of rice under threat. About 300 acres of rice fields have been destroyed by the birds.A single quelea can eat up to 10 grams of grain a day, according to the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). Farmers in western Kenya stand to lose close to 60 tonnes of grain to the birds. In 2021, the FAO estimated crop losses attributable to the birds amounted to $50m (£40m) annually.A red-billed quelea in a rice field. The organophosphate fenthion is sprayed to kill the birds. Photograph: Luke Dray/Getty ImagesThe spraying of fenthion, an organophosphate pesticide, has been the method of choice in fighting the pests in Africa, but the chemical has been described by researchers as “toxic to humans and to other non-target organisms”.“Fenthion can therefore injure or kill indiscriminately, with consequent adverse effects on non-target organisms,” the reasearchers concluded.Paul Gacheru, species and sites manager at Nature Kenya, a local affiliate to BirdLife International, said the method used to control quelea should be well-informed since “widespread use of non-target species avicides can result in environmental contamination and mass deaths of other birds and animals”.“Often, there is poor post-spraying site management, thus increasing the risk of poison-related wildlife deaths, especially among scavenging animals – hence the need to enhance education and awareness on quelea control,” he said.With an estimated breeding population in Africa of 1.5 billion birds, ornithologists say there are neither enough birds of prey to wipe out vast quelea colonies nor effective, environmentally friendly solutions.Simon Thomsett, a director at Kenya Bird of Prey Trust, said the culture of guaranteeing human food security above all else would be amplified “due to what we now perceive to be a probability, owing to climate change, as open grasslands that were quelea feeding grounds quickly turn into farmlands”.In wheat-growing parts of Kenya, Thomsett added, farmers have sprayed any species of birds deemed to be a threat to farms, “yet some of the birds are there to feed on insects that feed on their wheat”.But it is the effect the pesticide may have on the few remaining raptors that worries him most. “Those on the raptor conservation side of the fence are greatly alarmed at the spraying. Today, all raptors [in Kenya] are endangered. In any case, how effective has the spraying been in the last 60 to 70 years?”The FAO and the United Nations Environment Programme jointly administer the Rotterdam convention, whose aims include reducing risks from hazardous chemicals in agriculture. They have been considering listing fenthion in Annex III of the treaty, a list of pesticides and industrial chemicals banned or severely restricted on environmental or health grounds.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Global DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One way of improving the efficiency of control strategies is to detect the presence of suitable quelea breeding areas by satellite imagery … or to forecast where the birds are likely to breed,” the report said.It added: “Given that the birds’ migrations and breeding opportunities are determined by patterns of rainfall, it is possible to devise forecasting systems to predict where the birds are likely to breed and, thus, to concentrate activities in search of the colonies to areas where the birds are likely to be.”Quelea invasion frequently occurs in many African countries. Six months ago, the FAO released $500,000 to the government of Tanzania to support pesticide spraying, surveillance and capacity-building after 21 million quelea invaded rice, sorghum, millet and wheat fields.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",2023-03-10
 ExplainerWhy is the UK so unprepared for extreme heat and what can be done?,"Government’s climate advisers have warned for years about the fast-rising risk but little action has been taken

Extreme UK weather – latest updates
","['Damian Carrington', ' Environment editor', '@dpcarrington']","Is the UK prepared for the worsening heatwaves driven by the climate crisis?Absolutely not, despite years of warnings from its official climate advisers, the Climate Change Committee. “We’ve been telling the government for over 10 years that we are nothing like well enough prepared in the UK for the really hot weather we are seeing now,” said Lady Brown, the CCC’s deputy chair.The CCC’s five-yearly assessment in 2021 concluded the government was failing to protect people from a fast-rising risk. The report said: “Alarmingly, this new evidence shows the gap between the level of risk we face and the level of adaptation under way has widened [since 2016]. The UK has the capacity and the resources to respond effectively, yet it has not done so … Little preventative action is being taken to address health risks from overheating in buildings, and in homes in particular.”The CCC’s experts said they were frustrated by the “absolutely illogical” lack of action on adaptation, particularly as acting is up to 10 times more cost-effective than not doing so. The CCC’s repeated call for heat-proofing standards for new homes was long rejected by ministers, who cited a commitment to “reduce net regulation on homebuilders”.Can’t we just cope as we have with previous hot spells?No, because we have entered uncharted territory, with frequent extreme temperatures over prolonged periods. “We’ve got a very severe heatwave at the moment and all the evidence that we have is that they’re going to get worse,” said Prof Nigel Arnell at the University of Reading.The impact of these extreme heatwaves on people is deadly. “I’ve looked at the heatwaves in the past 10 years and we have had about 2,000 extra deaths each year in England,” said Dr Eunice Lo at the University of Bristol.Why is heat-proofing buildings so important?Because we spend most of our time in them. “We know that the housing stock is already overheating,” said Prof Mike Davies of University College London, who is a CCC member. “We think at the moment, approximately a fifth of it is, and that will get worse with projected climate change.”“Over the last few years, hundreds of thousands of new homes have been built that are not resilient to future high temperatures,” he told the BBC. “These will now require costly retrofits to make them safe, habitable and water efficient in the future.” Another concern is the rising trend of empty offices being converted into homes, which without care poses a “deadly risk”.Hospitals and care homes are especially important, as this is where the most vulnerable groups are – elderly people and those already unwell. But Miriam Deakin of NHS Providers said: “The NHS estate is not built to cope with extreme weather.”How are the impacts being tackled at the moment?In emergency mode, said Arnell. “But we can’t keep on dealing with extremes in crisis mode – they’re happening more and more frequently.” It might be acceptable to close the east coast mainline train route once a year, he said, “but what if it was closed every July for 30 days – that wouldn’t be acceptable”.Deakin said: “NHS trusts have bought up bottled water to give out to patients and staff and have ice-cream vans onsite and hospital kitchens making ice lollies for their colleagues and patients. Trusts are also mounting fans and installing industrial cooling units where possible.”What can be done?Harness the power of shade, said Prof Hannah Cloke at the University of Reading: “They do this in other countries where it’s very hot, it makes a massive difference.” Keeping curtains and blinds closed is useful but still traps heat behind them, which seeps into the room eventually. Only external shutters keep the heat outside. Painting surfaces white can also help.Trees for shade and cooling water features in urban areas are important too. “Walking into the university this morning through an avenue of trees, it was at least 10C cooler than out in the sun,” said Cloke. “We can no longer tolerate poor design of our buildings and our cities.” She also said public cooling places could be provided, as in Canada and elsewhere, where air-conditioned buildings or naturally colder ones such as churches are made available to the public.Insulation can also make a big difference. In the UK, this is usually considered in terms of keeping heat in during the winter, but it is also effective at keeping heat out in the summer.Either way though, the government’s main recent effort to increase home insulation was “botched”, according to a spending watchdog.What about public awareness?The stifling current heat is certainly attracting attention. But Bob Ward at the London School of Economics said: “More action is needed to inform the public about the dangers created by heatwave conditions. One part of the solution could be to name heatwaves in the same way that winter storms are now given names to gain the attention of the public.”Cloke said: “We also need to have more sophisticated forecast-based warnings that are more focused on people. It shouldn’t just be about peak afternoon temperatures, even though these really are very high indeed.” They should also take into account other factors, such as humidity, and spell out the risk to people, she said: “Heatwaves are silent killers.”Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BSTIs there any good news?The government finally introduced new building regulations on overheating﻿ in June. They state “reasonable provision” must be made to limit summer heating and “provide an adequate means” to cool properties. But they only apply to new homes, not the millions of existing homes that are overheating.No new technology needs to be invented. Prof Mike Tipton of the University of Portsmouth said: “Rome was really horribly hot in the middle of the summer so what did the emperors do? They built Tivoli Gardens just outside the city, full of trees, water, and fountains. The answer has been there for at least 2,000 years.”Why hasn’t more been done already in the UK?“I think the major problem is global heating is perceived as being still a problem for the future,” said Tipton. “That’s the public health message that we really need to get across – this is a problem that we need to be dealing with now.”Arnell said: “Progress is limited because responsibilities for action are spread across departments, agencies, private sector organisations and individuals. We will only make real progress when adaptation and resilience is given a high enough political priority.”Greenpeace UK’s Rebecca Newsom was even more blunt: “Political inaction has driven this crisis under the Conservative government’s watch.”",2022-07-18

"Crises have split European voters into five ‘tribes’, survey suggests","Attitudes to climate, migration, global economic turmoil, Ukraine and Covid will dominate this year’s elections, research indicates","['Jon Henley', ' Europe correspondent', '@jonhenley']","Europe’s voters are no longer divided into left or right, pro- or anti-EU camps, a survey suggests, but into five distinct tribes whose conflicting concerns are likely to dominate nearly 20 elections across the continent this year.The report argues that Europeans’ lives have been affected by five major crises in recent years - the climate emergency, the 2015 migration crisis, global economic turmoil, the war in Ukraine and Covid - and suggests voters in European parliament and national elections this year will focus on the one they feel most concerned by.The report’s authors argue that all five of these crises “were felt across Europe, although to varying intensities in different corners of the continent; experienced as an existential threat by many Europeans; dramatically affected government policies – and are by no means over”.The study’s co-author Mark Leonard said: “In 2019, the central struggle was between populists who wanted to turn their back on European integration, and mainstream parties that wanted to save the European project from Brexit and Trump.”“This time around, it will be a contest between competing fears of rising temperatures, immigration, inflation, and military conflict,” Leonard, the director of the Berlin-based European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) thinktank, said.Ivan Krastev of the Centre for Liberal Strategies in Sofia, Bulgaria, said the study showed that in terms of how they saw the EU, citizens were “drifting away from the ideological bonds of right and left” and were instead swayed more by their views of these crises.The report, A Crisis of One’s Own: the Politics of Trauma in Europe’s Election Year, suggests mainstream political parties might struggle to mobilise voters on issues such as the future of the European project, suggesting instead that they should “examine and propose solutions” for voters’ most urgent concerns.Overall, the report’s authors said, the climate crisis and immigration would prove the two biggest mobilisers in the election campaigns due to be fought across Europe in 2024 – as they were in the Dutch parliamentary poll in November.Make or break for the EU? Europeans vote in June with far right on the riseRead moreDutch voters placed Geert Wilders’ anti-immigrant Freedom party (PVV) top of the poll, with the pro-environment Green-Labour alliance headed by the former European Commission vice-president Frans Timmermans finishing second.“The struggle between these two ‘tribes’ is … a clash of two ‘extinction rebellions’,” the authors said. “Climate activists fear the extinction of human and other life; anti-migration activists fear the disappearance of their nations and cultural identity.”Voters who view immigration as the biggest crisis mostly back rightwing parties such as the National Rally in France or Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland (AfD); those who prioritise the climate tend to support green or leftist parties such as Spain’s Socialists or Poland’s Left.One early political consequence of this was the “Europeanisation” of migration as the EU sought to assuage voter concerns, the authors said, and, simultaneously, the “renationalisation” by rightwingers of the debate around slowing global heating.Issues by country tableBesides the European parliament election, due in June, voters in 15 European countries – including Portugal, Belgium, Austria, Croatia, Lithuania and the UK – go to the polls this year in national parliamentary and presidential ballots.The survey – of nine EU member states representing 75% of the bloc’s population, plus Great Britain and Switzerland – suggested that 73.4 million European voters believed the climate emergency was the single most important crisis affecting their future.Almost as many (72.8 million) felt Covid – which exposed the vulnerability of national healthcare systems, with major economic consequences – was the most important, while 69.3 million said global economic turmoil was their chief concern, 58.2 million opted for immigration, 49 million for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and 46.4 million chose none of the five.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Manuel de Almeida/EPAThe study found, however, that these voter “tribes” were not evenly distributed either geographically, by age or by education. Voters in Germany, for example, felt immigration was the most transformative crisis (31%), whereas in France it was climate change (27%).In Italy and Portugal, both of which were badly affected by the 2008 financial crash and ensuing eurozone crisis, a plurality (34%) of respondents said worldwide economic turmoil and the rising cost of living were paramount among their concerns.Fears about Russia’s war on Ukraine, meanwhile, were greatest in countries closest to the conflict: respondents in Estonia (40%), Poland (31%) and Denmark (29%) saw it as the most important crisis, against 7% in France and Italy and 6% in Spain and Great Britain.In terms of generations, the climate crisis topped the agenda among the young, with 24% of 18- to 29-year-olds considering it the most important issue for their future. That age group also saw immigration as its least important concern (9%).Issues by ageOf all age groups, older generations were most worried by immigration as a vital issue, with 13% of 50- to 69-year-olds and 16% of respondents aged 70-plus ranking it as their biggest concern. Among highly educated voters, the climate crisis was the chief concern (22%).For supporters of far-right parties in countries where they are not in power immigration was the issue that had most changed the way they look at their future, for example Reconquête (76%) in France, AfD in Germany (66%) and Reform in Great Britain (63%).In countries where the far right is in government, however, such as Italy, barely 10% of survey respondents reported immigration as their biggest concern, including only 17% of voters aligned with the Brothers of Italy party of Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni.The 2024 European parliament elections would be “about projections rather than projects”, the study’s authors said. “Each of Europe’s five crises will have many lives, but it is at the ballot box where they will live, die or be resurrected.“The European election will not just be a competition between left and right – and Eurosceptics and pro-Europeans – but also a battle for supremacy between the different crisis tribes of Europe.”",2024-01-17
More asbestos found in Sydney’s Rozelle parklands garden mulch as investigation into source continues,"Three additional mulch samples from park above Rozelle interchange tested positive for bonded asbestos, NSW government says

","['Catie McLeod', '@catiemcleod']","Asbestos has been found in additional samples of garden mulch taken from the Rozelle parklands in Sydney’s inner west, with the state government still unable to say where else in the city the contaminated material may have been used.The New South Wales transport department confirmed on Thursday that three of 34 samples taken from across the expansive park above Rozelle’s multibillion-dollar spaghetti interchange had returned positive results for traces of bonded asbestos.The same type of asbestos, which is considered lower risk than friable asbestos, was detected in two samples of garden mulch taken from the park earlier in the week. It was only discovered after a child brought it home from a playground.A spokesperson for the NSW Environment Protection Authority on Thursday said it had received “very early advice” from the supplier of the contaminated material that the use of this batch of mulch was “not widespread” in other locations.

 AGL brings forward closure date of two largest coal-fired power plants as market shifts to renewables,"Climate groups dismiss energy giant’s amended schedule for Loy Yang A and Bayswater as a ‘token effort’ that is ‘next to meaningless’

",['Peter Hannam'],"Energy giant AGL has accelerated the closure date of its two biggest coal-fired power plants by several years, responding to a market shift towards renewable sources of electricity.In an earnings statement on Thursday to the ASX, the soon-to-be-demerged energy company said its underlying first-half profit after tax fell 40.9% to $194m compared with a year earlier. Revenue rose 5% to $5.713bn.The main interest for many, though, will be the acceleration of the closure plans for AGL’s Hunter Valley-based Bayswater black coal-fired power station in New South Wales to “no later than” 2033 from its previously scheduled demise of 2035, while its brown coal-fired Loy Yang A plant in Victoria will now close by 2045 rather than 2048.‘Cutting through the greenwash’: Australian energy retailers ranked on climate actionRead moreThe timing of the closures, though, will depend on “the readiness of the entire energy system to operate without our critical baseload generation”, the company said.Market forces, though, may decide on a much earlier closure date than these revised schedules. The company gives a nod to that, providing “closure windows” of 2030-33 for Bayswater and 2040-45 for Loy Yang A.Worries about energy shortages have lately pushed up the cost of coal and gas globally, some of which has begun affecting wholesale power prices in Australia despite the falling share of fossil-fuel sources in the main national market. Wind, solar and hydro plants, whose energy costs are nearly free, generated almost a third of the electricity for eastern states in 2021.One of Australia’s oldest companies, AGL generates about one-fifth of the National Electricity Market’s power, with about 11,000 megawatts of capacity. By the end of this financial year, it plans to split into two, with most of the generation units going into its Accel Energy spin-off, and the retailing arm to make up AGL Australia.AGL’s Liddell plant, also in the Hunter, remains on track to close in April 2023, soon after the NSW state elections in March.In delaying Loy Yang A and Bayswater’s inevitable closure, AGL is putting worker and investor security, as well as the climate, at serious riskGreenpeace Australia PacificAGL said the timetable would lop emissions by 18-27% during the 2025-2045 period, compared with 2019 levels. Over the 2035-2046 period, those emissions would be 55-60% lower.“Our aim, by transforming our business, is not only to better address our own climate related risks, but also to take a key leading role in enabling Australia’s energy transition, creating long-term value and sustainable investment opportunities as we do it,” Graeme Hunt, AGL’s chief executive, said on an analysts’ call. “The energy transition and the path to net zero [emissions] will be the defining challenge of our era.”The company touted AGL as having the largest portfolio of renewable generation and battery assets of any ASX-listed company, with $4.8bn invested in renewables and similar assets over the past two decades.The plan to accelerate the plant closures amounts to “a significant contribution to Australia’s energy sectors’ decarbonisation process, with the possibility of improvement beyond this if Accel Energy is able to bring closure dates further forward within the closure ranges”, Hunt said.But Greenpeace Australia dismissed AGL’s amended schedule for Loy Yang A and Bayswater as a “token effort”.“AGL doesn’t even get a golf clap for its timid token effort in delaying the closure timeline for Loy Yang A, Australia’s worst-polluting coal-burning power station, to 2045,” said Glenn Walker, a senior campaigner at Greenpeace Australia Pacific.“In delaying Loy Yang A and Bayswater’s inevitable closure, AGL is putting worker and investor security, as well as the climate, at serious risk,” Walker said.“Loy Yang A and its attached brown coalmine pump out over 20m tonnes of climate pollution every year,” he said. “Keeping this brown-coal blight on our climate open until 2045 will produce a further 460m tonnes of toxic emissions, equivalent to the [annual] pollution from over 100m cars, putting Australia’s chance at a safer climate future in jeopardy.”In a sign that pressure to force Accel to speed up the plant closures is unlikely to abate, Dan Gocher, director of climate and environment at the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, said the timetable ignored “the majority of its shareholders with its failure to align the closure of its coal-fired power stations with the Paris agreement”.“Just five months ago, 53% of AGL shareholders supported a motion calling for Paris-aligned targets for both demerged entities,” Gocher said. “The AGL board has manifestly failed to heed that message.”Higher cost of fossil fuels drives wholesale power prices up despite falling market shareRead moreThe updated plan “is next to meaningless for these crumbling assets: in 2033, Bayswater will be 48 years old, and in 2045, Loy Yang A will be 61 years old”, he said.“AGL is facing increasing sustaining capital expenditure on its coal-fired power stations (up $17m to $162m), while it steadfastly refuses to invest in the transition, with growth and transformation capital expenditure declining (down $18m to $62m),” Gocher said.The federal energy minister, Angus Taylor, though, did not welcome the earlier closure times, saying the closure windows “leave a considerable gap of close to 5000MW of reliable generation in the National Electricity Market”.“While this announcement is a commercial decision and AGL has complied with the minimum 3.5-year notice period, the exit of such a considerable amount of reliable generation is a concern for the continued reliability and affordability of the system,” Taylor said.“Delivery of new, timely, replacement dispatchable capacity will be critical in keeping prices low and the lights on,” he said.AGL’s shares were up as much as 3% in early trade on the ASX, before giving up the gains and ending down 3.5% at $7.27.Nicholas Chapman, vice president, Moody’s Investors Service, said the weak half-year results were in line with market expectations and rising wholesale energy prices were likely to “stabilise” the company’s performance.“However, the improved near-term outlook is overshadowed by persistent longer term challenges, including the continued entry of low cost renewables and structurally lower consumer energy demand,” Chapman said. “In addition, the company’s planned demerger of its retail business in the face of [environmental, social and government] pressures will reduce diversification and increase its exposure to carbon transition risk.”",2022-02-10
 EU plans ‘massive’ increase in green energy to help end reliance on Russia,European Commission says extra €210bn needed over next five years to pay for phasing out of Russian fossil fuels,"['Jennifer Rankin', ' in Brussels']","The EU plans a “massive” increase in solar and wind power, and a short-term boost for coal, to end its reliance on Russian oil and gas as fast as possible.In a plan outlined on Wednesday, the European Commission said the EU needed to find an extra €210bn (£178bn) over the next five years to pay for phasing out Russian fossil fuels and speeding up the switch to green energy.Senior officials conceded that in the short term, the race to get off Russian gas would mean burning more coal and nuclear energy. The plan, drawn up in response to the Kremlin-ordered invasion of Ukraine and subsequent soul-searching about Europe’s dependence on Russian gas, proposes upgrades to the EU green deal, the bloc’s flagship policy to confront the climate crisis.The Commission proposed that 45% of the EU’s energy mix should come from renewables by 2030, an advance on the current 40% target suggested less than a year ago. Officials also want to cut energy consumption by 13% by 2030 (compared with 2020), in comparison with the current proposal of a 9% saving.“It is clear we need to put an end to this dependence and a lot faster before we had foreseen before this war,” said Frans Timmermans, the EU official in charge of the green deal. Contrasting the call to find €210bn to spend on new energy infrastructure, including windfarms and solar panels, he said the EU was spending €100bn a year on Russian fossil fuels. “Speeding up the transition means that money can stay in Europe, can help bring down the energy bills of European families and will not be used to finance this barbaric war in Ukraine.”But phasing out Russian gas means coal-fired power plants “might also be used longer than initially expected”, states the EU strategy. The decision to quit Russian gas has also led to a scramble to increase Europe’s imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from countries such as the US and Qatar, as well as pipeline gas from Azerbaijan.The commission said it would be necessary to spend up to €12bn – about 6% of the extra €210bn needed – to build LNG terminals and upgrade oil plants to allow EU member states to switch to non-Russian fossil fuels.Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BSTTimmermans said the EU could still meet its target of net zero emissions by 2050. “You might use coal a bit longer, that has a negative impact on your emissions,” adding: “If we can actually do what I say, reduce our energy consumption in combination with a speedier introduction of renewables, we will bring down our emissions even quicker than before.”The Dutch MEP Bas Eickhout, a vice-chair of the European parliament’s environment committee, said the commission was leaving the door open for member states to continue funding fossil fuel infrastructure. “Investments that are urgently needed for energy efficiency and renewables can still flow into new pipelines and terminals, this might continue our fossil energy dependency,” he said.Green campaigners voiced concern about plans to source LNG from states in the Middle East and Caucasus with poor human rights records, while criticising the green light for new gas infrastructure.The west can cut its energy dependency on Russia and be greener | Jeffrey FrankelRead more“The more we spend importing gas, the more we continue to expose the most vulnerable in our society to unaffordable energy bills, fuel the climate crisis and fund other repressive fossil-fuelled regimes around the world,” said Murray Worthy at Global Witness.To help speed up renewable energy, the EU wants to make it easier for companies to build wind and solar farms. Officials said it could take up to nine years to get a permit for a windfarm and four for solar. “And this is time we do not have,” said one. Any change in planning laws would require action from national and local authorities.",2022-05-19
AnalysisAnticyclone Scipio turns up heat in Mediterranean and north AfricaAlice Fowler (Metdesk),"Analysis: Andalucía in Spain could exceed 40C this week, with parts of Italy and Africa also affected",,"Extreme and prolonged heat engulfing parts of Spain, Italy and north Africa shows no signs of easing this week. Anticyclone Scipio has been bringing hot air from Africa to the central Mediterranean, causing weeks of scorching temperatures.An anticyclone – an area of high pressure – is the opposite of a cyclone. Some countries name anticyclones if they are likely to bring severe weather such as searing heat. This is similar to the way most countries, including the UK, name areas of low pressure, or cyclones, if they bring severe weather in the form of heavy rain or strong winds.Temperatures are forecast to reach the high 30s Celsius across the Mediterranean, with some parts of Spain, Italy and north Africa in the low 40s. The Andalucía region of Spain is predicted to exceed 40C most days this week – about 4-5C above the climate average.While anticyclonic heat is not unusual in the Mediterranean, the unrelenting nature of this event has brought an early and dramatic start to the summer, with healthcare centres in the Canary Islands and Balearics on high alert.People cool off by a fountain in Piazza del Popolo, Rome, as Anticyclone Scipio raises temperatures in Italy.

At first, the downpours – more than 60mm on Tuesday – will hit Guangdong and Fujian in China as well as northern Taiwan. But as low pressure drifts north-eastwards, torrential rain will extend from northern Taiwan and up the East China Sea before reaching the Kagoshima region of Japan before the weekend. Daily rainfall could reach 65-80mm in these areas, bringing a significant risk of flooding.Torrential rain in south-eastern China in the past two weeks has killed 15 people in landslides and building collapses. Heavy rain has also damaged roads, bridges and telecommunications facilities in Yunnan province and Guangxi.Further south, significant rain is expected across South Island, also known as Te Waipounamu, in New Zealand. Its northern coastline including the Southern Alps could experience more than 50mm of rain a day between Tuesday and Thursday, with further downpours expected this weekend. Cumulative rainfall totals for the northern coastline could exceed 250-300mm this week.",2022-06-06
‘I can’t afford groceries’: why one-third of US college students don’t have enough to eat,"There are now around 800 food pantries on US college campuses, and demand is growing as pandemic-era resources end","['Supported by', 'About this content', 'Jessica Fu']","For Anthony Meng, a senior at Hamline University in Saint Paul, Minnesota, food insecurity can take on many different forms. On some days, it means skipping meals as he’s rushing to work or to class. On others, “it’s like, I don’t think I can afford groceries,” he said. “Which is difficult to say at times, but it’s the reality of the situation.”Meng, 22, rolls out of bed every morning around 9 or 10am. His schedule is typically packed with back-to-back lectures and extracurriculars. More often than not, Meng finds himself heading out for the day with just a granola bar in hand, if anything at all.Fortunately there’s a place on campus where he can seek refuge: the Food Resource Center, a beloved hangout where students and staff can stock up on free fresh produce and groceries. Funded by donations, grants and student fees, the center also offers prepared meals, microwaves to heat them up in, and couches and a TV for people to gather, eat and pass the time.“It’s an area of campus where I can not only find solace,” Meng said. “The fact that I can go get a hot meal […] it means the whole world.”Shelves are stocked with food and supplies inside the Food Resource Center at Hamline University in Saint Paul, Minnesota. The center serves as a community space where students and faculty can access free food with no questions asked. Photograph: Brooklynn T Kascel/The GuardianPantries like the Food Resource Center are an increasingly popular resource as food insecurity persists among college students. Recent estimates put the number of campus pantries at about 800, most of them established in the past decade.According to a 2020 survey of more than 195,000 students across the country, conducted by the Hope Center at Temple University, nearly 30% of students at four-year colleges reported experiencing food insecurity. For those at two-year colleges, the number was even higher – almost 40%. And with changes to student eligibility requirements for federally funded hunger relief programs set to take place in May, advocates say the situation could get even worse.Most Hamline students, including Meng, plan their visits to the Food Resource Center around its delivery days – Wednesdays and Fridays. After the food donation trucks pull away, the center’s aisles start to brim with a medley of staples and unexpected treats, from perfectly fine produce to an array of unsold Trader Joe’s snacks.For the past two years, Meng has received no financial assistance from his family to cover tuition or rent, so he works at H&M on weekends to pay for school and basic needs. The ability to get food on campus at no cost, with no questions asked, means that it’s just a little bit easier to focus on simply being a student.Anthony Meng at Hamline University in Saint Paul, Minnesota.

He will also grab a prepared meal to eat later, after the long dance rehearsals that take up the rest of the afternoon. For students who can’t make it to the center in person, there’s a grocery delivery service. During Ramadan, the center extended its hours to 9pm so observant Muslim students could grab something to eat after breaking their fasts.Despite high rates of hunger, students face an uphill battle when trying to access the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), the federally funded hunger relief program that gives people monthly allowances for groceries. Since the 1980s, people who attend school on a more than part-time basis have been largely excluded from Snap, out of concern that students from well-to-do backgrounds would draw public resources instead of assistance from their families.So instead of qualifying for Snap based on asset and income requirements – as the majority of Americans do – college students also need to work at least 20 hours a week, a requirement that anti-hunger advocates say is onerous and unreasonable for someone who is attending classes and doing school work every day. Advocates argue that strict eligibility rules for full-time students are based on antiquated ideas of who attends higher education. In the decades since these restrictions were put in place, the proportion of post-secondary students from low-income backgrounds has increased steadily. According to a 2019 Pew Research study, the number of undergraduate students from families in poverty was about 20% , representing a more than 50% jump in the prior two decades.Yet despite the evolving profile of “typical” college students, lawmakers have done little to update Snap eligibility rules to reflect their current economic realities.Kyler Daniels, 27, brings in groceries with her daughter, Nova, in Rocky Mount, North Carolina on 26 April. Daniels, who is pursuing a master’s degree in social work and works full time, is anticipating losing additional pandemic-era Snap benefits. Photograph: Rachel Jessen/The GuardianThroughout the coronavirus pandemic, the federal government temporarily lifted the 20-hour work requirement for students. But after the public health emergency declaration expired in May, Snap rules will soon revert to pre-pandemic standards. According to one study, pandemic Snap exemptions for students made an additional 3 million people eligible to enroll in the program than would not have otherwise. Now, many of them will find themselves without grocery money that they’ve grown to depend on for three years.“Oftentimes, the general public thinks of college students as that 18- or 19-year-old who’s continuing their education from high school,” said Jaime Hansen, executive director of Swipe Out Hunger, which advocates for policies to alleviate food insecurity among college students. “That’s no longer the majority.”Still, the archetype of the typical college student who can draw from family resources and devote all their time to school persists.Kyler Daniels, a 27-year-old mother and student knows this intimately. Daniels lives in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, with her daughter and boyfriend. While pursuing a master’s degree in social work part-time and remotely, she also works a full-time job at a local non-profit that supports children.As a parent, food security is always at the top of her mind. Her family relies on food stamps, but when we spoke in March, she was bracing for them to get cut after the recent elimination of extra pandemic benefits. She supplements grocery store hauls with food boxes from a local church, or occasional free food at work. She tries to feed her daughter fresh fruits and vegetables when possible, while also trying not to overspend.Kyler Daniels, 27, outside her home with four-year-old daughter, Nova, in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. Photograph: Rachel Jessen/The GuardianDaniels says she regularly faces a lack of empathy from professors and administrators about the challenges of balancing education with parenthood and a career. Situations like hers are often perceived as unusual or abnormal, she said, and she often encounters resistance when asking for accommodations that help her balance being a mom and a worker, as well.“Moms, families, just individuals who have other things outside of going to school – I just wish people will be more considerate of that,” she said.In the past decades, researchers have uncovered countless ways that hunger is detrimental to academic performance: it can impair student focus; it can lead to poor mental health, and serve as a strong predictor of depression and anxiety; and it can even get in the way of students graduating and getting their degrees at all.Meng at Hamline isn’t enrolled in Snap, but knows many peers who are already bracing for the end of their benefits. At some campus food pantries, there have been worrisome hints in recent months that food insecurity is already on the rise.Alex Silver, 21, is the student director of the food pantry at the University of Washington. In the fall quarter of 2022, the pantry saw over 3,600 visits – more than double the demand during the same window back in 2019. Part of this can be attributed to increased outreach and marketing. Nonetheless, Silver notes the pantry itself is struggling to keep up with the rapid increase in demand.In February, the pantry saw more than 400 visits in a single week, a threshold it hadn’t hit before. Squeezed by high needs and high costs, the pantry has had to laser in on how it spends funding, which all comes from donations. The pantry’s canned foods used to include Spam, beets and carrots. Now that’s been replaced by rows and rows of canned corn. Previously, it was able to offer basic hygiene items, like toilet paper, shampoo and tampons in addition to groceries – those are all gone, too. To ensure that shelves don’t go empty as soon as the pantry opens, food has to be rationed out on a points-based system that considers each item’s caloric value and nutritional profile.Kyler Daniels, 27, opens a ukulele her mother bought for Daniels’ daughter, Nova, at their home. Photograph: Rachel Jessen/The Guardian“[People] are not just coming for themselves, but maybe their entire household,” Silver said. “It’s very hard for us to have enough food for everyone, certainly not enough for everyone to get as much as they need.Silver pointed out that high demand is emblematic of a much broader problem, one that charitable organizations alone can’t resolve. “For us, the main struggle is that a lot of people hope or expect the food pantry to be the solution for food insecurity on our campus. And we’re just not at a point and probably will never be a point where that could be our function. But we can help dampen the effect of it in every single possible way that we can.”Other food pantries on campuses around the country are feeling similar constraints, caught between rising demand and falling food donations. Looking toward to the summer and fall, advocates and students alike are concerned that food insecurity could soar as supports like Snap become harder to access once again.“We are frankly really concerned,” Hansen said. “A lot of the pandemic resources that were supporting students in their higher education goals are falling by the wayside […] So we’re very worried about what the next couple of months is going to look like for our student population.”",2023-12-07

 Australia's miners urge Europe to define nuclear power and fossil fuels with carbon capture as 'sustainable',Minerals Council of Australia has been accused of trying to export its ‘negative approach to climate policy’ ,"['Supported by', 'About this content', 'Adam Morton', ' Environment editor', '@adamlmorton']","The Minerals Council of Australia has weighed into a European Commission climate policy debate, urging it to back fossil fuels with carbon capture use and storage (CCS) and nuclear power on a list of environmentally friendly developments.In a written submission to the commission, the minerals council (MCA) said a proposed EU taxonomy for sustainable activities intended to shape investment under a European green deal was inconsistent in how it dealt with clean technologies because it favoured solar, wind and biofuels over nuclear and CCS.The mining lobby group said it was concerned this approach would have a flow-on effect on the types of energy investments backed by EU-based companies across the globe and “increase the cost of reducing CO2 emissions”. It called for an overhaul.InfluenceMap, a London-based thinktank that tracks corporate climate lobbying, said the MCA’s submission suggested it wanted to export its “negative approach to climate policy” by pushing for changes in other parts of the world that would allow continued use of coal and gas.The MCA submission argued there was “no valid basis” for treating CCS and nuclear differently given EU countries currently used coal, gas and nuclear.Western Australia LNG plant faces calls to shut down until faulty carbon capture system is fixedRead moreIt quoted the International Energy Agency in saying emissions from existing energy fleets needed to be significantly reduced by 2030 if countries were to achieve the widely held goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. The minerals council said this would require technologies such as CCS.“Underpinning the MCA’s concern is the broad-ranging investment impacts the taxonomy will have, not just within the European Union but anywhere European Union-based firms invest,” the submission said.But InfluenceMap’s program manager, Rebecca Vaughan, said the MCA appeared concerned a science-led approach to dealing with the climate crisis would hurt the industries it represented.“While the MCA says it wants the EU to take a technology neutral position, its submission appears to advocate for the continued use of coal and gas with carbon capture utilisation and storage, which is clearly at odds with the commission’s science-based policy,” Vaughan said.The MCA has long been accused of hindering action to tackle the climate crisis in Australia, and campaigned aggressively against Labor’s two attempts to introduce a carbon pricing scheme.In recent years it has come under pressure to change its anti-climate stance from its biggest members, BHP and Rio Tinto. It followed the big mining companies facing repeated calls from their investors to abandon the MCA over its commitment to coal.It resulted in the MCA releasing a climate plan that said it was committed to the Paris agreement and reaching net zero emissions, but did not include a timeframe in which that target should be reached.The EU taxonomy is intended to help it meet a target of at least a 55% cut in its emissions below 1990 levels by 2030 on the way to net zero by 2050.It considers a development sustainable if it makes a substantial contribution to one of six environmental objectives, does no significant harm to any of the other five and complies with minimum business safeguards. The environmental objectives are: climate change mitigation, climate adaptation, sustainable use and protection of water resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.The commission said it expected the taxonomy would “create security for investors, protect private investors from greenwashing, help companies to plan the transition, mitigate market fragmentation and eventually help shift investments where they are most needed”.Tania Constable, the MCA’s chief executive, said “the technology-led transformation required” could not happen without Australia’s minerals and raw materials.She said InfluenceMap had got it wrong. “[It] clearly opposes a lowest-cost, faster-paced approach to global decarbonisation,” she said.“The MCA and all of its members are taking serious action on climate change and are committed to the Paris agreement and its goal of net zero emissions. The MCA advocates the inclusion of all low and zero emissions energy sources in the EU’s sustainable finance taxonomy because unequal treatment of nuclear and CCUS in particular undermines the EU’s own objectives.”The final version of the EU’s sustainable finance rules was due in January but a decision was delayed until April after 10 countries objected to the initial proposal because they wanted gas to be deemed a sustainable energy source.Nuclear energy plays a significant role in some EU countries, but the International Energy Agency (IEA) reported its future was uncertain in wealthy nations as ageing plants were expected to close due to cost and regulatory decisions. It said this trend could affect climate goals.The forecast decline of nuclear has coincided with generation from cheaper renewable energy growing significantly from a low base.CCS, which most commonly involves capturing emissions and pumping them underground, remains at a relatively early stage of development despite pledges of billions of dollars in funding. It is used in some industrial processes, but has sometimes been financially viable only when employed to increase oil extraction from an underground reservoir.It is yet to be proved viable as a means of reducing emissions from fossil fuel power generation. One of the world’s most prominent CCS projects, the Petra Nova power generation facility in Texas, was mothballed last year because of its poor financial performance.The Morrison government has backed CCS as one of five priorities to receive support under its low-emissions technology roadmap, and opened a $50m fund for applications earlier this month.Several observers noted it was a relatively little funding if the government was serious about developing the long-stalled technology. Some of is expected to be will be dedicated to exploring the “use” of captured CO2 to turn it into products such as building materials.Nuclear energy remains banned in Australia. Some Coalition MPs and industry leaders want the prohibition lifted. This article was amended on 23 March 2021 to include the EU’s criteria for a sustainable activity and the IEA’s assessment of nuclear generation",2021-03-23
" I sat on a wet towel, my stepfather sent apocalyptic texts, but our long-term response to the UK’s heatwave must be actionEmma Beddington","As our brains return, briefly, to room temperature, it’s time to think about what we do next",,"A week after The Great British Bake In, it’s 13C and drizzling here: North Yorkshire is (temporarily) healing. I have been giddily sending pictures of pewter skies and cagoule sightings to my sister who, unwisely for a red-headed northerner, lives in steamy Paris. The whole business feels like a collective fever dream, but, of course, it wasn’t: as melted roads and scorched verges, drifts of autumnal leaves and warnings of an imminent drought declaration demonstrate, and as thousands of climate scientists testify hourly with weary urgency.So, as our brains return to room temperature, it’s time to work out how to respond next time. Nationally, structurally, our lack of preparedness for extreme heat is a disaster in waiting, as more wearily urgent experts keep telling us. But, given the far more pressing business of choosing the ugliest possible font for leadership contest materials, and Dominic Raab explaining we should “enjoy the sunshine” shortly before much of the A2 caught fire, it looks like we’ll be thrown back on our own resources.I don’t think anyone here quite nailed heatwave strategy this time round, except my husband, who spent it working in a chainsaw distribution centre in Belgium. This was an eccentric, but apparently successful approach: his climate-controlled office was icy. “Air conditioning is a maladaptive heat response,” I hissed at him from my own heatwave office (a wet towel on the bathroom floor), listlessness momentarily pierced by bitter envy. The ancient dog repeatedly got into his furry padded envelope bed and had to be physically restrained from coddling himself to death. My best friend posted a very funny Twitter thread on her ancestral Cambodian strategies for heat survival (sample tip: “When you’re too tired to keep doing nothing, take a nap. You can try using a fan if you want, but that will only waft the mosquitoes about, up to you”) and had the Khmer Rouge explained to her by strangers. Paris sister took the 19th-century aristocrat’s approach and headed to the coast, only to be greeted by record-breaking 40C temperatures there. Checking in on my stepfather, who is also ginger, and in the age bracket where checking in is recommended, I was initially worried: “I’m calling innocent and guilty to repent, for the day is at hand,” he texted, floridly, as if the four horsemen of the Apocalypse were just parking up in the short stay around the corner. By early evening, his angrily eschatological response felt entirely appropriate.My coping mechanism was to become even more obsessed than usual with my local flora and fauna. It was eerie out in the hairdryer heat: lairy local sparrows cowed into silence, the vegetation crispy and shrivelled. In the garden, a vast gull wandered, open-beaked and confused, in search of shade (or, knowing gulls, possibly carrion). I topped up birdbaths, put out rehydrated mealworms, chucked washing-up water on plants and distributed bee revival kits to bemused family members. I fretted about the pigeon fledglings in the tree outside my window and tried to persuade everyone to shower standing in a bucket.I am not virtue signalling my selfless, saintly response: it is my version of climate denial, trying to create a tiny, self-contained corner where I can, as far as possible, pretend disaster is not happening. That is a failure of imagination like any other, really. Faced with the scale of human tragedy from the climate crisis now and the prospect of worse to come, I am trying to persuade two gormless pigeons to take a bath. It’s just fiddling really, while, well, everywhere burns.The truth, of course, is that even if we mend our Mad Dogs and Englishmen ways, learn to close the curtains, and hydrate, we cannot really cope. “I can’t go through that again,” said my stepfather the next day. “But what’s the alternative?” I asked, “Die?” He said that was, indeed, his medium-term strategy. For the rest of us, the best and sanest adaptative response is anger, and action. Let’s do it now, while it’s, briefly, cooler.

Country diary: ‘hedge’ is too small a word for these wild Cornish giants,"Port Quin, Cornwall: In places, these vertical jungles reach five metres high, constricting the lanes into deep green ravines",['Carey Davies'],"The narrow road is flanked by things for which the word “hedge” seems inadequate; they are more like walls of wildness, bristling and impenetrable linear jungles where the vegetation is so abundant and overflowing that it is hard to tell one plant from another.In places, these super-hedges reach five metres high, constricting the lanes into deep green ravines, the sides bristling with a heady jumble of trees, bushes, herbs, creepers, ferns and flowers. When we arrived here last night, via these gorge-like back roads, my car’s proximity sensors were continually confused by drooping foxgloves and lolling heads of agrimony.Today, on a wander down to Port Quin, I take a closer look at one of these formidable boundaries. Celebrated hallmarks of the Cornish landscape, there are 30,000 miles of them weaving through the county, some still following lines inscribed in the bronze age.This one is like a forest floor – wildflower meadow and scrubland combined – flipped vertically. The greenish-white hazes of hedge bedstraw, with its fine-petalled flower clusters, roam through the hedge like breeze-blown clouds. Blooms of honeysuckle, buddleia and meadowsweet throw out heady billows of scent. There are sprawling knots of ivy and bramble. A wind-flattened hawthorn grows from the top of it all, sculpted by winds from the Atlantic. There is the blue-violet of tufted vetch; the pinkish white of dog rose; an extravagant cluster of purple betony. Zooming in further, there is herb robert, devil’s-bit scabious and the occasional sprig of wild fennel, which thrives in the salt-sprayed maritime soil.There is a kind of heady midsummer madness to it all, but it is a controlled chaos, underlain by careful construction work. The road-facing side of the hedge is all riotous plant life, but a glance around the “back” reveals a drystone wall, built from the local Devonian slate in a rough herringbone pattern that reinforces an earthwork core.The “hedge” is an ingenious fusion of artificial and organic elements, part wall and part wood, a hybrid of human skill and natural creativity. The result is something impregnable that will endure for a very long time. Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary",2021-07-19
LettersHow Scotland is leading the way in seaweed farming,"A new academy dedicated to seaweed industry hopes to help the industry thrive in coastal communities around Britain, says Prof Nicholas JP Owens",['Letters'],"Thank you for your article highlighting the wonders of seaweed as a crop that can be sustainably grown and harvested at sea (Sea-farmed supercrop: how seaweed could transform the way we live, 19 April).The article used an example from Sweden, but the seaweed industry is already growing at pace around our own shores. The Scottish Association for Marine Science in Oban, an independent marine research laboratory and part of the University of the Highlands and Islands, will help the industry grow with the launch of our Seaweed Academy on 26 April.The Seaweed Academy, the UK’s first dedicated seaweed industry facility, will use our research knowledge to offer advice to startups, train workers and help businesses develop.Seaweed farming has a low-carbon footprint, using no fresh water and with minimal land-based infrastructure. Indeed, we have been running trial seaweed farms for more than 10 years.Globally, the seaweed farming industry has been growing exponentially and is estimated to be worth around $15bn (£12bn) per year. As your article stated, the vast majority of this activity is in Asia. However, there is huge growth potential in Europe, with growing demand for seaweed from gourmet restaurants to livestock feeds. The macroalgae is already used extensively in food ingredients, agriculture, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.We are keen to share the knowledge that we have gained over decades of research in the hope that seaweed can become a thriving industry for coastal communities around the UK.Prof Nicholas JP OwensDirector, Scottish Association for Marine Science",2022-04-25
LettersPaying smart meter owners to use less electricity may harm poor people’s health,Steve Thomas fears some will boost their income at the expense of their health – using the money to eat instead of heat,,"Smart meter owners will be grateful recipients of payments from National Grid if they reduce their electricity consumption at peak times during the current cold spell (Households in Great Britain to be paid to use less electricity: how does it work?, 23 January). While this might help keep the lights on, the risk is that low-income households who are already not consuming as much energy as they need to protect their welfare will take the opportunity to boost their income at the expense of their health – using the money to eat rather than heat.However, there is a potential stick to go with this carrot and that is the option of charging consumers more for electricity at peak times. This will only be possible when all consumers have smart meters. It is proving hard enough to convince consumers to install them without downsides becoming apparent. As with the current scheme, power demand will be reduced at peak time. However, instead of giving consumers money to do this, they will be penalised if they do not and the welfare consequences in terms of increased excess winter deaths, already far too high, will be serious. The sensible course would be to prohibit use of high prices to reduce electricity demand at peak times. Steve Thomas Emeritus professor of energy policy, University of Greenwich",2023-01-31
Country diary: A perilous feast for the voles and birds,"Deerness valley, County Durham: Thanks to a local ‘Phantom Feeder’, there are easy pickings for the wildlife on this walking route – but this also means dicing with death",['Phil Gates'],"We had walked this route many times before meeting the mysterious figure we’d dubbed the Phantom Feeder, scatterer of birdseed along the former railway line. He’s been out early this morning; there’s fresh seed on a boulder halfway down the hill, attracting an appreciative flock of blue tits, great tits, dunnocks, chaffinches and a robin.There’s no shortage of wild seeds and berries yet, but the instinct to lay down body fat before winter has drawn them to these deluxe easy pickings. It’s risky, though: kestrels hunt here. Only the coal tits seem cautious, flitting in to pick up seed then retreating into a hawthorn, too quick for my camera to capture, before returning for more.The Deerness Valley in autumn. Photograph: Phil GatesA bank vole, leaving the safety of long grass, joins the feast. They are usually fleeting shadows in the undergrowth, leaving us wondering whether we really saw them. Yet here is one, twitching whiskers and chestnut coat, sitting on its haunches, nibbling seeds, dicing with death if the kestrel returns.We amble downhill, to the turning point in our walk, to a seat bearing a worn brass plaque commemorating the Button family, “who farmed this land for 58 years”. Across the path, fixed to a rowan, there’s a plaque celebrating the life of Olive (1920-2020), “A Lady of the Deerness Valley”.Many local people have a strong attachment to this secluded landscape. It’s easy to see why; there’s a nuthatch feeding among the lemon-yellow hornbeam leaves in front of us and the crowns of trees in West Wood, across the valley, are turning every shade of autumn. It’s a seat with a view, where the troubles of the world are banished from thought. We exchange greetings with cyclists freewheeling downhill, and a runner labouring in the opposite direction. Members of a riding school give us a cheery wave as they clip-clop by.The Phantom Feeder comes into view, his seed bag empty. We’ve been acquaintances – though not yet on first name terms – for a year now, exchanging wildlife news. I tell him about the vole; he’s seen a sparrowhawk this morning. He’ll be here, with his bag of birdseed, every morning until spring. Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary",2023-11-17
 Bird flu ‘prevention zone’ declared across Great Britain,Strict biosecurity measures introduced from midday after largest outbreak yet in UK,['PA Media'],"An avian flu “prevention zone” has been declared across Great Britain in the face of rising case numbers as the country battles its largest ever outbreak of the disease.At midday on Monday, it became a legal requirement for all bird keepers in Great Britain to follow strict measures to protect flocks from bird flu, including keeping free-range birds in fenced areas and stringent biosecurity for staff on farms.The move by the chief veterinary officers of England, Wales and Scotland follows an increase in the number of cases of avian flu being detected in wild birds and commercial premises in recent weeks.The UK has faced its largest ever outbreak of the disease in the past year, with 190 cases confirmed across the country since late October 2021, 30 of which were confirmed since the beginning of this month.In the east of England, which has been particularly badly hit, mandatory housing measures for all poultry and captive birds in Norfolk, Suffolk and parts of Essex were introduced earlier in October.The disease has also ripped through breeding colonies of seabirds, killing thousands in some sites and affecting threatened species from puffins to hen harriers.Officials say the avian flu circulates in wild birds and when they migrate to the UK from mainland Europe over the winter they can spread the disease to poultry and other captive birds.Under the prevention zone rules, producers with more than 500 birds must restrict access for non-essential people on their sites, staff must change clothing and footwear before entering enclosures and vehicles will need regular cleaning and disinfecting.Backyard owners of smaller numbers of chickens, ducks and geese must also take steps to limit the risk of the disease spreading to their flocks, they are being warned.In a joint statement, the chief veterinary officers said: “Bird keepers have faced the largest ever outbreak of avian flu this year and with winter brings an even more increased risk to flocks as migratory birds return to the United Kingdom.“Scrupulous biosecurity and hygiene measures is the best form of defence, which is why we have declared an avian influenza prevention zone (AIPZ) across Great Britain, meaning that all bird keepers must take action to help prevent the disease spreading to more poultry and other domestic birds.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

US’s first large-scale offshore wind project produces power for first time,"Vineyard Wind development, off Massachusetts coast, starts to deliver power to New England grid in moment hailed as ‘historic’","['Oliver Milman', '@olliemilman']","The US’s first large-scale offshore wind project, located off the coast of Massachusetts, has started producing power for the first time, delivering a boost to Joe Biden’s ambitions of a proliferation of coastal wind turbines to help combat the climate crisis.The first wind turbine in the Vineyard Wind development started to whirr on Tuesday, delivering around 5MW of power to the New England grid. The operator of the project said it expects to have five turbines operational in the early part of this year, before eventually having 62 turbines as part of the project, which will produce enough electricity to power 400,000 homes.UN experts alarmed by Alabama plan to kill prisoner using untried gas methodRead more“This is a historic moment for the American offshore wind industry,” said Maura Healey, the governor of Massachusetts. “This is clean, affordable energy made possible by the many advocates, public servants, union workers and business leaders who worked for decades to accomplish this achievement.”The US has been slow to develop offshore wind compared with some other countries, but Biden has enthusiastically backed the concept, with the White House setting a goal to deploy 30GW of offshore wind by 2030, enough to power 10m homes with clean energy, and several projects are now planned.Vineyard Wind, about 15 miles (24km) off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard, is the largest so far and its launch is “truly is a milestone for offshore wind and the entire renewable industry in North America”, according to Tim Evans, a partner at Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, which is developing the project with Avangrid, which is itself owned by a Spanish electricity utility.The breakthrough, which has occurred more than a year after developers started assembling and installing the 850ft-tall turbines in the ocean, comes just a month after a separate, smaller, project begun off the coast of New York. The 12-turbine project, called South Fork Wind, is operated by the Danish wind energy developer Ørsted and the utility Eversource.The arrival of Vineyard Wind is a welcome tonic to a nascent offshore wind industry that has struggled in the US in recent months, despite support from the Biden administration and amenable east-coast state governors.On Wednesday, the energy giants Equinor and BP terminated their agreement to sell power to New York state from their 1,260MW Empire Wind 2 offshore windfarm, citing rising inflation, higher borrowing costs and supply chain issues. Equinor blamed “changed economic circumstances on an industry-wide scale”.Last year, Ørsted also canceled two large offshore wind projects in New Jersey due to concerns over high costs, supply chain problems and the failure to secure hoped-for tax credits.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

","['Graham Readfearn', '@readfearn']","Federal environment officials have agreed to look again at 18 proposed new coal and gas projects after a Queensland environment group submitted requests to have the effects of climate change considered.None of the 18 projects has been approved under the country’s environment law, but have been through a process where the environment minister determines the nature and scale of their likely impacts.In July, lawyers for the Environment Council of Central Queensland sent documents to the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, asking her to reconsider decisions made under previous ministers going back to 2011.Projects from major coal and gas companies – including Woodside, ConocoPhillips, Whitehaven and Glencore – were included in the request.In a statement, the federal environment department said on Friday that “after careful consideration” it had decided each request was valid and all new information had been placed on its website and was open for public comment until 24 November.Tracking Australia’s progress on the climate crisis and the consequences of global heatingRead more“As this is a legal process, and the minister is the decision maker, she is unable to make public comment at this time,” the statement said.Under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, projects are considered by the minister at two stages.

At the first stage, the minister lists the habitats, species and ecological communities that could be affected by a project. At the second and final stage, the minister either denies environmental approval, or grants it with conditions.The Environment Council of Central Queensland used a little known process related to the first stage known as a “reconsideration request” where new information is submitted that had come to light since original decisions were made.Expert reports from two Australian climate science experts, Prof David Karoly, of the University of Melbourne, and Prof Lesley Hughes, of Macquarie University, are part of the new evidence.The council’s president, Christine Carlisle, said: “Until now, former environment ministers failed to take climate change into account when considering which animals, plants and places could be harmed by a coal or gas proposal.“Assessing the risks and harm of new coal or gas should account for all the evidence, including how it would contribute to climate breakdown.”Hollie Kerwin is the principal solicitor at Environmental Justice Australia, which is representing the council.“What these requests really do is ask the minister to take into account the global scientific consensus and the granular information on the impacts of new coal and gas on all of these living wonders,” Kerwin said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

More coal and gas would just be adding fuel to the fire we need to put out.”The Greens environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, welcomed the reassessments, saying: “An enormous amount of scientific evidence showing the detrimental effect of climate change on Australia’s matters of environment significance – from the Great Barrier Reef to koalas – was given to the minister. She must not ignore it in her decision making.“Any project, not just these 18, that comes across the minister’s desk must be assessed according to the climate and nature crisis we are in right now.”",2022-11-04
Our bid for more solar panels was left out in the cold,We paid a deposit for solar panels with Green Energy Together but all we’ve got is scaffolding,['Anna Tims'],"We had solar panels fitted in 2019 as part of the Solar Together initiative, and this year wanted to add to them. We chose Green Energy Together as it had done Solar Together projects with our council. We paid a £1,340 deposit. There was then a rather odd silence, but finally scaffolding and two installers appeared. The installers hadn’t been told the panels had to be fitted in addition to those already there, so the kit they had brought was inappropriate. Since then, in spite of daily phone calls and promises from the company that someone would ring back, nothing has happened.We eventually cancelled our order by phone and email, and asked for the return of our deposit and the removal of the scaffolding. Again, there has been silence, even from the company director we emailed directly. We are concerned that this company has over-reached itself while holding on to our money (and that of a lot of other people, if Trustpilot is to be believed). We are also concerned that the scaffolding is still on our house and is a security risk. Solar panels are an obvious route amid an energy crisis, and it is worrying this path seems to be made so difficult and full of obstacles.AJ, LondonThe irony is the Solar Together scheme promises to make solar energy more accessible and more affordable to households who might not otherwise risk the investment. Councils group buy the best available deal from a vetted company at auction, and households who have registered an interest are sent a quote. Many households have benefited from the concept, but some installers, who auctioned their services, may have accepted more work than they can handle.Green Energy Together’s Trustpilot page makes for alarming reading, not just because 69% of reviews rate the company as bad or poor for the same reasons you cite, but because Trustpilot itself warns that it’s had to remove fake reviews. Trustpilot tells me that the company had ignored a formal demand to cease its “abuse” of the platform after “multiple suspected fake four-and five-star reviews” were detected.It says: “Ultimately, this enforcement action did not deter the business and, as a result, in June we terminated its paid subscription with Trustpilot. We also placed a warning banner on its Trustpilot page alerting consumers to its abuse of our platform.”So far, so bad, for a company whose website declares it keeps alive the “principles and values” of the late Queen. I put this alleged abuse – and the details of your ordeal – to Green Energy Together’s director, Nick Elbourne. He blames supply chain shortages and claims customers were sent a newsletter advising them of delays until the end of October. As for the Trustpilot abuse, he says that the platform had not provided enough information about the fake reviews for him to “diagnose the issue”.Over then to iChoosr, which runs the Solar Together scheme, and claims to vigorously vet the suitability of installers it works with. It also insists it caps the number of households which can apply for a quote if its installers reach full capacity. It told me Green Energy Together has, so far, completed 2,000 installations, but Covid and Brexit had created “unprecedented issues” with supply chains and staffing.“We are aware of some customers who have not had such a smooth journey, as we run our customer services alongside those of the installers that win our auctions, and we are working with Green Energy Together to resolve issues,” it says.Green Energy Together got in touch with you after I’d alerted iChoosr to your plight. The scaffolding was removed within three days but, two weeks after a promise that the deposit would be refunded, you’re still waiting for your money.Email your.problems@observer.co.uk.

" This article is more than 10 months oldCutting air pollution improves children’s lung development, study showsThis article is more than 10 months old",Conclusions from long-term survey in Sweden come days after 10th anniversary of Ella Kissi-Debrah’s death in London,"['Nicola Davis', ' Science correspondent', '@NicolaKSDavis']","Reducing air pollution could improve lung function development in children and cut the numbers of young people with significant pulmonary impairments, research suggests.The impact of air pollution on health has become a topic of intense concern in recent years, with research suggesting it can affect every organ in the body and the World Health Orgazisation noting children’s developing organs and nervous systems are more susceptible to long-term damage.The issue was thrown into the spotlight in 2020 after nine-year-old Ella Kissi-Debrah became the first person in the UK to have air pollution listed as the cause of death on their death certificate.Ella’s mother, Rosamund Kissi-Debrah is now a leading campaigner for cleaner air, advocating for Ella’s law – legislation that would make clean air a human right.Researchers have previously found even low levels of air pollution can reduce lung function development from the ages of six to 15. However, the new study suggests cleaning up the air can bring improvements.“That’s a strong message to policymakers and city planners that actions to decrease air pollution level and exposure will pay off in the long term, definitely, for children and across the life course,” said Prof Erik Melén, paediatrician and professor at the department of clinical research and education, Karolinska Institutet, who co-authored the new study.Rosamund Kissi-Debrah, whose daughter Ella died from air pollution 10 years ago, viewing an artwork projection at London’s South Bank – Breathe For Ella, by Dryden Goodwin. Photograph: David Parry/PAWriting in the European Respiratory Journal, Melén and colleagues note that lung function typically grows rapidly during adolescence, before reaching a peak by the early 20s. However, people experiencing reduced growth are potentially at higher risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as adults.Melén and colleagues analysed data collected as part of a wider study in which a cohort of children in Stockholm born between 1994 and 1996 were followed up from birth to the age of 24, with measurements of lung function collected at age eight, 16 and 24. Crucially, said Melén, the research did not focus on particular populations, such as those with asthma or who only lived in highly polluted areas. “This is real-life data,” he said.By analysing the measurements of 1,509 participants for which lung function data was available at eight years old and at least one subsequently timepoint, the team was able to track their lung function development. They then used participants’ addresses to estimate their exposure to air pollution over time, including particulate matter known as PM2.5 and PM10, as well as black carbon and nitrogen oxides.Overall, although not for all participants, long-term air pollution exposure levels decreased over the study period – a finding Melén said could be down to a number of factors, including a more modern car fleet, the rise of electric vehicles, and traffic restrictions.After taking into account lung growth expected as a result of adolescence, as well as factors such as smoking, parental education and air pollution exposure in the first year of life, the team found that reductions in air pollution were associated with an increased growth rate of participants’ lung function. For example, the mean growth rate in forced expiratory volume in one second increased by 4.63mL a year for each 2.19 μg/m3 decrease in PM2.5.“We estimate that this [equates to a] couple of percent [improvement in lung function growth rate] over a 10-year period,” said Melén. While he said the increase was not huge on an individual level, over a longer period the impact could be large, while it also meant fewer children would fall below the bar of normal lung function.Compared with those having no air pollution decrease, participants who experienced a 2.19 μg/m3 decrease in PM2.5 would have a 20% lower risk of having clinically impaired lung function, the team said.“With better air quality, we reduce the risk of children [having] … clinically impaired lung function. That’s indeed important because those patients end up in my clinic as a paediatrician,” said Melén. “In the long run, any incremental improvement in lung function will have a positive effect on the risk of acquiring chronic diseases in adulthood, or even life expectancy.”",2023-02-23
Train carrying hazardous materials derails in North Dakota,"A Canada Pacific train derailed on Sunday night, affecting 31 of its 70 cars, and spilling petroleum used to make asphalt",['J Oliver Conroy'],"A train carrying hazardous materials derailed in North Dakota late on Sunday night in the latest toxic railway accident to hit the US.The incident happened less than two months after a train derailed near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border, causing a raging fire and leaking cancerous chemicals near the small town of East Palestine.Two trains derail in Washington and Arizona amid rising rail safety concernsRead moreThe incident on Sunday involved a Canadian Pacific freight train that derailed around 11.15pm, according to initial reports, affecting 31 of the train’s 70 cars. Spilled cargo from the derailment included petroleum used to make asphalt.Emergency response personnel and hazmat experts were at the crash scene, in a rural area of Richland county, on Monday morning. There was no fire and the spill occurred in a cold and snowy area, minimizing the threat to public safety, according to the rail company.Officials will allow the spilled materials to freeze in order to aid the cleanup, which is expected to take seven to 10 days.The derailment in East Palestine earlier this year sparked an outcry over what critics call insufficient safety regulation of the transportation of hazardous materials. Sensors on the track – whose parameters were set by the private rail company, Norfolk Southern – failed to alert conductors in time that a car bearing had become wildly overheated, according to initial findings by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).The Norfolk Southern train derailed 38 cars, including 11 known to contain toxic materials, causing explosions, a fire and a massive plume of smoke. The spilled cargo included vinyl chloride, a flammable chemical known to cause liver cancer. Rail officials, concerned at the prospect of the vinyl chloride exploding, chose to burn off the chemical in a controlled fire.Residents in the immediate vicinity of the East Palestine derailment were ordered to evacuate in case of an explosion, but most were told to shelter in place. Officials from the rail company and from the US Environmental Protection Agency have said that the area is now safe, but some independent scientists and outside activists have expressed grave concerns.Writing in the Guardian, Stephen Lester, a toxicologist at the nonprofit Center for Health, Environment & Justice, argued that the decision to burn off the vinyl chloride “unleashed a gigantic cloud full of particulates that enveloped surrounding neighborhoods and farms in Ohio and Pennsylvania”.Burning vinyl chloride generates dangerous compounds called dioxins, Lester said, which are associated with the military herbicide Agent Orange and with Love Canal, New York, the site of one of the most notorious chemical disasters in the US.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

 To my wife’s annoyance I am getting obsessed with litter – is this what middle age feels like?Arwa Mahdawi,"Philadelphia, where I live, is nicknamed Filthadelphia and I’m getting more disgusted by the day",[],"I have been having some very dirty thoughts lately, and it’s been driving my wife bonkers. “Just look at all the litter!” I’ll exclaim numerous times a day. “Why is there so much rubbish on the street? Why aren’t there more bins in this city? Why does Philadelphia [where I live] have such a subpar municipal waste management system?” These are all valid questions (there is a reason Philly has the nickname Filthadelphia), but my wife doesn’t want to hear about city sanitation any more. “Please,” she keeps saying, “get over it!”The thing is, I can’t get over it. Is it a function of middle age? Am I losing my mind? I don’t know what has precipitated it, but I am hung up on waste management. I have gone full disgusted-of-Tunbridge-Wells about it, as we all should, really. Litter isn’t just unsightly and unhygienic, it is associated with more crime and antisocial behaviour: cleaning up neighbourhoods makes them safer. Sanitation workers are the unsung heroes of the streets: the US should be diverting some of the money it gives to its bloated police departments to street cleaners. If I was going to run for mayor (I’m not), that would be at the top of my policy platform.Five weird and wacky ways councils are cracking down on litterRead moreAlso on my policy platform: come up with more imaginative ways to deal with trash. Look at Taiwan. They have this fascinating system where rubbish isn’t supposed to touch the ground. You are responsible for throwing your household waste into rubbish trucks yourself; the trucks play little musical jingles, like ice-cream vans, so you know when they’re in your area. It forces people to take responsibility for their waste and encourages them not to produce so much of it. Unfortunately, I’ve reached my word limit so will have to continue this conversation with my wife. She’ll be delighted. Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist",2022-06-29
" Climate crisis: economists ‘grossly undervalue young lives’, warns Stern","Economists have failed to take account of ‘immense risks and potential loss of life’, says author of landmark review","['Damian Carrington', ' Environment editor', '@dpcarrington']","Many economic assessments of the climate crisis “grossly undervalue the lives of young people and future generations”, Prof Nicholas Stern warned on Tuesday, before the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow.Economists have failed to take account of the “immense risks and potential loss of life” that could occur as a result of the climate crisis, he said, as well as badly underestimating the speed at which the costs of clean technologies, such as solar and wind energy, have fallen.Stern said the economics profession had also misunderstood the basics of “discounting”, the way in which economic models value future assets and lives compared with their value today. “It means economists have grossly undervalued the lives of young people and future generations who are most at threat from the devastating impacts of climate change,” he said. “Discounting has been applied in such a way that it is effectively discrimination by date of birth.”Nicholas Stern. Photograph: David Levenson/Getty ImagesYouth protests around the world, sparked by the school strike of Greta Thunberg, have been a key factor in increasing demands for action in recent years, along with rising extreme weather events. Recent research shows people born today will suffer many times more extreme heatwaves and other climate disasters over their lifetimes than their grandparents.However, Stern said: “The move to net zero [emissions] can be the great driver of a new form of growth – the growth story of the 21st century. This growth will be more resource-efficient, more productive, and healthier, and will offer greater protection to our biodiversity.”Renewable energy costs have fallen dramatically and electric cars are moving to scale, he said, while 75% of global emissions are now covered by national commitments to net zero emissions by the middle part of century, though “some of those commitments are more credible than others”.Stern’s remarks are based on a paper to be published in the Economic Journal of the Royal Economic Society and made to mark the 15th anniversary of the landmark Stern review on the economics of the climate crisis in 2006. It concluded that the costs of inaction on climate were far greater than the costs of action and that the climate crisis was the biggest market failure in history.Since the publication of the report, carbon emissions have risen by 20% and Stern was scathing about much of the economic analysis that has informed policymakers. “Cavalier treatment of risk, and the missing of the very rapid technical progress, means the models have been profoundly misleading,” he said. The theory of discounting had not been related to its ethical foundations, he added, or allowed for the risk that global heating will make future generations poorer.Political action has been slow since 2006, Stern said, because of the persistence of the “damaging” idea that climate action cuts economic growth and also because of the global financial crisis, which diverted attention and cut middle-class incomes, making politics more “fractious”.“The economic question now is: how do we manage the radical transformation we have to make in the world economy in the next 20 or 30 years?” he said. “How do we promote the 2% or 3% extra investment we’ll need – which is a very valuable investment, not a cost.”A whole range of policies are needed, Stern said, including carbon pricing, regulation, product standards, investment in research and reform of capital markets. A critical factor is the provision of large-scale, low-cost finance to fund the low-carbon transition, especially in developing countries.Stern was directly involved in the negotiation of a promised $100bn a year in climate finance from rich nations in Copenhagen in 2009. But this has yet to be delivered and it is a vital goal of Cop26. On Monday, developed countries released a delivery plan to mobilise the funding, projecting the goal would be surpassed in 2023 onward, after being nearly attained in 2022. Nick Mabey at the E3G thinktank said it was “just about credible”.The Stern review was criticised by some when published as exaggerating the risks of the climate crisis. “The idea that I was alarmist is just laughable in retrospect. We underestimated the dangers. The costs of inaction were very worrying 15 years ago – they are immensely worrying now.”",2021-10-26

Financed by the west’s insatiable demand for fossil fuels, cities filled with air-conditioned skyscrapers and shopping malls have risen from the desert, and it’s not surprising that Gulf monarchies made rich and powerful by oil have paid little heed to thoughts of an economic transition to renewables, even though the region is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the world.

Country diary: a wagtail’s feathers conduct a riverside hunt,"Sandy, Bedfordshire: On the trail of damselflies, the bird’s tail beats its own rhythm, down, up, down, keeping time with its rear","['Derek Niemann', '@DerekNiemann']","Hovering only a splash above the bottom of the weir, a jiggling ball of flies catches the eye of a bird on a stick. It dashes across. One false flap might cast it down to drown into the churn, but there is really no need for my heart in my mouth.How is supreme agility possible in a creature encumbered with an appendage of feathers as long as its body? The grey wagtail shows the exceptional manoeuvrability of any flycatching bird, its tail transformed into a pliable rudder. In one action it drops, dips, flips, jinks and flits, giving shrill peeps as it shoots full-beaked through the willows in an undulating flight of apparent exuberance.Among the UK’s three species of wagtail, the grey lives up and down to its name more than the others. Neither the migrant yellow nor the resident pied wagtail exhibits quite such an exaggerated bob. The regular tail-dipping of their waterside cousin is as inevitable as breathing.Below the railings on the next bridge is a scatter of banded demoiselle wings – compelling evidence that a second pair of breeding wagtails here are stripping off the inedible parts of damselflies before feeding them to their young in a crevice nest nearby. Sure enough, one of the pair appears, alighting on a raft of waterweed in the middle of the river. The moment it comes to rest, it sets off in motion. Up flips its tail, as high as its head, maybe higher. Down, up, down, keeping a rhythm with its rear. All the while the head stays steady, beak leading the hunt.After a few seconds of stillness, the bird’s beating tail starts to lose momentum, until it is reduced to a quiver. That slowing seems to be the cue to go, for the wagtail suddenly springs and makes for the opposite bank; the same rolling flight of peaks and troughs. It lands on a precipitous riverside ledge, where a steadying pause might be in order. But no, off goes the tail again, conducting its own beat. Not drowning but waving.

 Boris Johnson to launch two-year election campaign in May,"Tory chair hits out at ‘net zero dogma’, Corbynistas and ‘cancel culture brigade’","['Rowena Mason', ' Deputy political editor']","The Conservative chair has announced that Boris Johnson will kick off a two-year election campaign from May, as he hit out at “net zero dogma” and sought to pitch Labour as still linked to Jeremy Corbyn.Oliver Dowden, the party co-chair and former culture secretary, made his comments in a speech at the Tory spring conference in Blackpool, as the party attempts to draw a line under the prime minister’s troubles over alleged lockdown-breaking parties. As part of an attempt to downplay the scandal, the Brexit minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg, dismissed the furore over Partygate as “disproportionate fluff” compared with the crisis in Ukraine.Having survived calls for his resignation from Tory MPs, Johnson appears to be trying to show the party and country that he intends to fight the next election. Dowden announced that the Tories would open the candidate list for the next election and declared: “The challenge starts this May.”He said the election would look a lot more like 2015, when David Cameron fought against Ed Miliband, than 2019, when Johnson took on Corbyn.Next general election will be decided in north of England, says thinktankRead more“We are going to have to fight this one seat by seat, promise delivered by promise delivered, doorstep by doorstep,” he said. “And from May, we will begin our two-year election campaign with the launch of our target seat strategy, building on the experience of the 40:40 campaign in 2015, building capacity, developing profile and framing the choice.”In a sign that the Conservatives are still concerned about the threat of Nigel Farage taking voters on the right, Dowden hit out at “net zero dogma” in comments that will dismay many concerned that the Tories are prepared to water down their commitments to tackling the climate emergency.“I really think the British people want to see a bit of conservative pragmatism, not net zero dogma,” he said. “We are Conservatives. We exist to conserve. We will get to net zero. Of course we will save the planet. We just don’t want Vladimir Putin taking it over while we are doing it.”His comments coincided with a speech from Johnson at the Scottish Conservatives conference, where he sought to draw a dividing line with the Scottish National party and Labour by suggesting they were pushing to go too fast on “net zero”.Johnson’s own climate advisers on the committee on climate change have advised a “presumption against” new exploration in the North Sea, but he said: “Are we not crazy to be talking about completely shutting down domestic production?“Only to buy oil and gas at a vast mark-up from Vladimir Putin’s Russia. And yet that unbelievably is the stated policy of the Scottish National party and the Labour party.”Boris Johnson appoints combative election strategist David Canzini Read moreJohnson spoke just after the Scottish Tory leader, Douglas Ross, a week after he withdrew his letter of no confidence in the prime minister, citing the war in Ukraine.Dowden also made it clear that the Tories were planning to portray Starmer at the next election as “dull … uninspiring … and bereft of ideas”. He also sought to claim that “the Corbynistas are still there”, reviving the idea of Labour as a danger that was used in the 2019 campaign.“Let’s not be complacent about the threat that Starmer’s party still poses,” he said. “Starmer can’t resist kowtowing to the cancel culture brigade because his base are the cancel culture brigade.”The Conservatives had been widely thought to be planning an election for May 2024 but the imminent repeal of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act means it could more easily be called sooner.",2022-03-19
 UK to lift import restrictions on food from Fukushima,Remaining curbs on food imports imposed after 2011 nuclear disaster to be scrapped,"['Justin McCurry', ' in Tokyo']","Food from Fukushima will be freely available in the UK from Wednesday, weeks after Boris Johnson snacked on popcorn from the Japanese prefecture hit by a triple nuclear meltdown in March 2011.Britain restricted Fukushima imports after the disaster, the world’s worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl, but has gradually lifted them, even as other countries limit or ban produce from the region.Johnson confirmed that the remaining restrictions would end on Wednesday in a meeting the previous day with the Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, on the fringes of the G7 summit in Germany.Johnson told Kishida that UK-Japan relations were going from “strength to strength”.“Two great island democracies, united in our values, determined to stand up together against autocracies and the dangers of drifting backwards in the world, but also wanting to do more together on technology, on security, on trade, and of course I’m delighted that tomorrow – finally – we are able to have Fukushima-origin products all over the shops in the UK,” he said.The supermarket chains Tesco and Waitrose have said they have no immediate plans to sell Fukushima produce. Instead, many of the items will be available at Japanese restaurants and specialist Japanese stores in England, Scotland and Wales.The restrictions will remain in place in Northern Ireland, which is subject to European Union rules on food and drink from Fukushima and other prefectures affected by the accident 11 years ago.The scrapping of the restrictions was made possible after the UK Food Standards Agency dropped a limit of 100 becquerels – a measure of radioactivity – per kilogram contained in Japanese food.“Our risk assessment shows that removing the 100 becquerels per kilogram (Bq/kg) maximum level of radiocaesium for food imported from Japan to the UK would result in a negligible increase in dose and any associated risk to UK consumers,” the FSA said in a report late last year.The Fukushima prefectural government says that, post-disaster, its food safety standards are among the most stringent in the world. The government-set upper limit for radioactive caesium in ordinary foodstuffs, such as meat and vegetables, is 100 becquerels per kilogram, compared with 1,250Bq/kg in the EU and 1,200Bq/kg in the US.The lifting of restrictions will affect 23 food products, such as mushrooms, which previously needed to carry proof that they had been tested for radioactive material, according to Nikkei Asia.Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BSTThe Japanese government said it “welcomes the fact that the UK government reached this decision based on scientific evidence, as it will support the reconstruction of the affected areas”.It added that it would “continue to work towards the early lifting of the remaining import restrictions in the EU and other countries and regions”. China, Russia, South Korea, Indonesia, Taiwan and several other countries still impose import restrictions.Johnson first sampled Fukushima produce in 2017 when, as foreign secretary, he swigged a can of peach juice given to him by his Japanese counterpart, Taro Kono, declaring it “Yum”.",2022-06-29
" A stingray: do they get a little light-headed as they feel the electricity brighten, speed up, then die?Helen Sullivan","Most venomous creatures store their poison in a gland. Not the stingray, whose venom is in its very tissue",,"Where do you begin with an animal whose mouth looks like a face, whose face is split into two – half at the top, and half the bottom; who can breathe with either part – from spiracles behind the eyes, or gills behind the mouth; whose teeth are scales; whose scales are teeth-like (denticles)?When stingrays hunt, they lose sight of their prey – their eyes are bad, and their prey is often underneath them. To find and feel clams, mussels, crabs and fish, the rays rely on electroreceptors in their skin, or, as National Geographic puts it, “special gel-filled pits”. They literally inhale their food, gulping down the electric signal. As they do this, they breathe through the spiracles behind their eyes, which work less efficiently than their gills. Do they get a little light-headed, breathing as if through a towel, feeling the electricity brighten, speed up, then die?“Maybe it’s like feeling the presence of someone hiding in a dark room,” says the narrator of a YouTube video explaining how this electric sense works. “Every time a fish opens its mouth to breathe, it exposes its mucous membranes to the salty water, creating a tiny voltage that disappears every time the mouth closes.” In this way (that fish mouth movement is called, grossly, “buccal pumping”) each fish produces an electric frequency of two hertz: the same as the number of breaths.The swan: would it seem so perfect if there were not usually a goose hissing nearby? | Helen SullivanRead moreThe pores on the stingray’s face are called “ampullae of Lorenzini”. They’re dark, and give the ray the appearance of a five o’clock shadow’s worth of stubble. The gel in the pores is highly conductive. It carries the particular signal to cells that read it, and tell the ray what it is: prey just big enough, and alive enough, to swallow whole. Like a fish mouth, a clam, too, opens and closes; a crab draws saltwater over the gills on its carapace.Stingrays are venomous. Most venomous creatures store their poison in a gland. Not the stingray, whose venom is in its very tissue. It has no bones. Poisonous tissue, electric senses: where do you begin?At Heron Island, on the Great Barrier Reef, I saw young stingrays. They were very pale gold, the same colour as the sand. They shuffled in groups of four, or seven, or 12, where the almost waveless ocean met the flat beach. Seen through the impossibly clear water, they seemed almost transparent, figures of clear metal bumping up against the water’s edge, like ghosts trying to cross into the living world.

InterviewCan I recycle a pizza box? We ask the expertCoco Khan,Recycling specialist Adam Herriott on what happens when household waste goes in the wrong bin – and what to do with compostable coffee-cup lids,['@cocobyname'],"Of all the memories I have of the pandemic last year, the image of bins sticks in my mind. Black bins piled high, green recycling bins stuffed with packaging from online deliveries and takeaways. Occasionally, I’d see a pizza box resting on top, as if whoever had left it was unsure where it could or should fit in. According to research, the amount of waste produced by each household in Britain rose by a fifth last year. But are we dealing with it in the right way? And where should that pizza box go?I spoke to Adam Herriott, resource management specialist at Waste and Resources Action Programme (Wrap), a charity that focuses on recycling and the circular economy.Putting the wrong thing in the wrong bin is known as ‘recycling contamination’. Is it a problem?It’s a big issue, because it only takes one person on your road to put rubbish in their recycling bin for the whole truckload to be rejected. Before I worked at Wrap, I was a recycling manager at a place where materials are separated, and our rejection rate was about 9% of vehicle loads.That’s high. What sort of stuff were people putting in their bins?All sorts. Firearms. Animals.Quick GuideSaturday magazine ShowThis article comes from Saturday, the new print magazine from the Guardian which combines the best features, culture, lifestyle and travel writing in one beautiful package. Available now in the UK and ROI.Photograph: GNMWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.I did not expect this conversation to take such a turn.Mostly, it’s the stuff that should go in the regular bin. It’s important people don’t “wish-cycle” – where they are not sure but put it in anyway.I’ve also heard it called ‘aspirational recycling’, which makes it sound weirdly glamorous.It happens all the time. People need to check with their council or use Recycle Now’s guide. Commingled bins used to be the thing, but segregated bins assure quality. If the paper and cardboard in your bin is kept clean and dry, it can easily be recycled, so it’s valuable.Where does a pizza box fit? It’s not exactly clean.It’s fine to be recycled as long as there’s no cheese stuck on the box, in which case, rip that bit off. It’s what we call “3D waste” – food and other solids – that’s the problem. And give containers a rinse. Wash and squash.Can we talk to aliens? And should we colonise space? We ask the expertRead moreIt’s probably not great that takeaway places switched to cardboard as part of the war on plastic if it ends up too soggy to be recycled.We would never say one material is better than another. We just ask people and businesses to look at the bigger picture. Take compostable coffee-cup lids: if you don’t have a food waste bin or a home composting system, it will end up in the regular bin. Or sometimes people think it’s plastic. If compostables get in with the plastics, it can cause big problems.This all sounds a bit high stakes. I thought this conversation would help my anxiety dreams.One wrong thing in the recycling can be handled – it’s just when there’s too much of it. For example, people put nappies in because they’re papery, even though they’re full of …3D waste.Right. It can get everywhere in the back of a vehicle.How did the pandemic change our recycling habits? Everyone’s bins looked different. Mine was full of glass, until I switched to boxed wine. We’re waiting on the official data but, anecdotally, it sounds as if we recycled more, yes. But food on pizza boxes wasn’t a problem. I’d never waste good pizza.",2021-10-08
 Greece plans to name heatwaves in the same way as storms,"Personalising the ‘silent killer’ hot spells could raise awareness in time to avert loss of life and property, say scientists","['Helena Smith', ' in Athens']","Spurred on by this summer’s record temperatures, Greek scientists have begun discussing the need to name and rank heatwaves, better known for their invisibility, before rampant wildfires made the realities of the climate crisis increasingly stark.A preventative measure, the move would enable policymakers and affected populations to be more prepared for what are being described by experts as “silent killers.”Greece has experienced two bouts of extreme heat since June, both unusually prolonged and intense, with the second wave lasting almost three weeks. A new rise in temperatures last week saw Athens once again fall victim to peri-urban fires, with devastating blazes breaking out north-west of the capital. Dr Kostas Lagouvardos, research director at the National Observatory of Athens, told the Observer it is clear the extreme heat has been underestimated.“This very hot summer has given us a snapshot of a future climate in 20 or 30 years’ time when we’re likely to have very long periods of very high temperatures,” he said. “It’s extreme behaviour but it could become the norm. Unlike other adverse weather events, you can’t see extreme heat.”It was essential, he insisted, that both state authorities and citizens were aware of the dangers. “We believe people will be more prepared to face an upcoming weather event when the event has a name,” he said. “They’ll become more aware of the possible problems it could cause to their lives and to their properties … heatwaves cause a lot of deaths; they don’t make noise and they may not be visible but they’re a silent killer.”Greece has been far from alone in enduring extreme heat or forest fires in recent months. The mercury hit 48.8C in Syracuse, Sicily on 11 August – the hottest temperature recorded in Europe – with infernos erupting across the Mediterranean.But in a region regarded as a climate crisis hotspot, Athens is mainland Europe’s hottest metropolis, singled out in repeated studies as likely to suffer hugely from the consequences of a warmer planet. On 3 August, the country’s highest ever temperature of 47.1C was registered in northern Greece.Mega fires – some blamed on arsonists – have consumed vast tracts of land in recent weeks, destroying homes and leading to mass evacuations, most noticeably on Evia, the nation’s second largest island.A firefighting helicopter makes a water drop as a wildfire burns in the village of Vilia, Greece, on Wednesday. Photograph: Alkis Konstantinidis/ReutersForced to issue an apology following fierce criticism over his administration’s handling of the blazes, Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the unprecedented weather had effectively “turned the country into a powder keg” with close to 600 fires flaring up in the space of a week.“This is the climate crisis striking here and now,” he told CNN. “We need to drastically change the way we produce electricity, build our buildings, grow our food and move around.”The fall-out from what Mitsotakis also described as the nation’s biggest ecological disaster in decades has been immense, with the leader also being forced to announce a €500m relief package and create a new ministerial post overseeing recovery from natural disasters. More than 20 countries dispatched firefighters, equipment and planes to Greece.Four years ago, Greek meteorologists began naming winter storms and other adverse weather phenomena as the challenges to lives and properties became clear.Lagouvardos, who trained in France and is the Observatory’s chief meteorologist, said ranking heatwaves would be “trickier” because categorisation inevitably involved gauging temperature distribution and population densities.But, more generally, heatwaves were easier to predict in intensity and duration than storms. If temperatures of over 40C persisted for more than a week, Greek scientists believed they should be named, he said. The same series of alternate male and female monikers drawn from Greek history and mythology that had been used for storms could now be applied to heatwaves.Athens is among the few cities globally – and the only metropolis in Europe – to have appointed a chief heat officer.Less than a month after she assumed the role, Eleni Myrivili, an academic and former vice-mayor, regards the initiative as a possible game-changer in the way extreme temperatures are managed.“The whole idea of making heatwaves more visible by naming and categorising them in terms of severity would be a turning point,” she said. “It would help people understand the danger that is looming while enabling decision-makers to trigger policies that would better protect them.”",2018-05-16
 Rio Tinto plans for Serbia lithium mine suspended after protests,Local authorities put $2.4bn project on hold after scale of opposition shakes country’s government,['Associated Press in Belgrade'],"Local authorities in western Serbia have suspended a plan that would allow the mining company Rio Tinto to operate a lithium mine, after protests by environmentalists that shook the country’s populist leadership.The mining had been expected to start in the near future, but a town council in Loznica voted to suspend a regional development plan that permitted the excavation of lithium. The vote followed the suspension last week of two key laws in Serbia’s parliament that ecologists said would help the multinational firm start the project.Rio Tinto’s past casts a shadow over Serbia’s hopes of a lithium revolutionRead moreFor three consecutive weekends, thousands of protesters in Belgrade and elsewhere in Serbia blocked main roads and bridges to oppose Rio Tinto’s plan to launch a $2.4bn (£1.4bn) mining operation in the country. The protests were the biggest challenge yet to the increasingly autocratic rule of the Serbian president, Aleksandar Vučić.“Whether there will be a mine depends on people [in western Serbia] and the study on environmental impact assessment,” said the prime minister, Ana Brnabić. “These are the two conditions that the president stated earlier.”Rio Tinto said in a statement on Thursday that it worked in accordance with laws and the highest professional standards throughout its 10-year presence in Serbia in order to launch “the largest mining investment in this part of the world”.View image in fullscreenThe Jadar valley where Rio Tinto plans to build a mine, near Loznica. Photograph: Oliver Bunic/AFP/Getty Images“We understand the interest of citizens in everything that happens in connection with the project, and we will continue to provide information on all aspects of the project for which we are responsible and in which we participate,” the statement said, according to the independent Beta news agency.Although Rio Tinto said it would adhere to all the latest environmental protection standards, organisers of the weekend protests said the lithium excavation could inflict lasting ecological damage to rivers and farmland in the region.Now that the lithium mine plans are on hold, Vučić said earlier this week that from now on “we will have to speak in a different way to Rio Tinto and others”.Lithium, which is used in batteries for electric cars, is considered one of the most sought-after metals of the future as the world shifts to more renewable energy sources.As Serbia faces an electricity shortage, Vučić has ignored European Union pleas for countries to reduce CO2 emissions and pledged to continue and even expand coalmining for power plants.Environmentalists are upset at the Serbian government’s lack of response to rising pollution in the country.",2021-12-16
 UK moves closer to allowing gene editing of crops by allowing more research,Government says gene editing can develop climate crisis resistant crops while critics fear it is another step towards GM,['Fiona Harvey'],"Research into the gene editing of plants in the UK will become much easier with new rules brought forward by the government that will encourage field trials and other development efforts.Ministers said cutting red tape on gene editing research would help to develop new strains of crops that need less pesticide, have less environmental impact and provide better nutrition. The new rules, introduced in the form of a statutory instrument laid in parliament on Thursday, will apply only to research, rather than allowing gene-edited crops into widespread cultivation or consumption.It is part of a gradual approach towards gene editing by the government, after public consultation last year. The preferred direction of travel is clear, however, with ministers having repeatedly voiced support for gene editing and genetic modification as aids to modernising farming.Jo Churchill, the minister for agri-innovation and climate adaptation, said: “New genetic technologies could help us tackle some of the biggest challenges of our age, around food security, climate change and biodiversity loss. Now we have the freedom and opportunity to foster innovation, to improve the environment, and help us grow plants that are stronger and more resilient to climate change.”Field trials will still require notification to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and any future crops or foods would be subject to separate authorisation requirements, as at present. The new rules apply only to gene editing, the process of working on a plant’s existing genome, to speed up what could be achieved through natural selection, rather than genetic modification, which can include importing genes from other species.The government cited sugar beet that is resistant to common viruses, wheat strains that contain less of a possible carcinogen and are adapted to the climate crisis, and tomatoes resistant to mildew, as promising areas of research for UK scientists.Campaigners have expressed concern that the government’s moves over the past year, since Brexit made it possible for the UK to ditch some of the EU’s strict rules on GM, may be the prelude to much greater use of gene editing and GM.Pat Thomas, the director of Beyond GM, a pressure group, said: “Today’s announcement is a sop to the biotech research establishment that doesn’t really address the most significant hurdles that developers need to face, which are that farmers don’t really want to grow genetically engineered crops and citizens don’t want to eat them.”She added: “There’s a lot of techno-optimism about what kind of gene-edited foods might materialise one day. But none of the crops Defra is talking about is close to coming to market. After 35 years of use, genetically engineered crops have not delivered much in terms of real value and they have largely been a distraction from more meaningful discussions about what kind of food system we want and need to transition to.”Scientists welcomed the rule changes. Prof Nick Talbot, the executive director of the Sainsbury Laboratory, in Norwich, said: “We can achieve the outcomes of plant breeding – which has been so successful in controlling diseases and improving yields – but in a much more precise manner … to produce nutritious crops requiring much lower fertiliser inputs and with greater resilience. We need innovation to help us escape from the chemical treadmill of current agriculture. In the face of the climate emergency, doing nothing is no longer an option.”",2022-01-20
" Give horse riders equal access to English woodlands, say campaigners",Equestrian groups call for riders – who are mostly female – to get same access rights as cyclists and walkers,"['Helena Horton', ' Environment reporter']","The government must allow horse riders access to England’s publicly funded woodlands, equestrian groups have said.Those who ride horses are banned from many scenic countryside routes, including many footpaths, meaning that most are severely restricted in their access to nature.Rachel Thompson, from The Trails Trust, which works to create multi-function public rights of way, has been campaigning for riders to get the same rights of access as cyclists and walkers.She said: “Seventy-nine per cent of the right of way network is footpath so it is only open to walkers. The bridleway network is very fragmented and disconnected, a lot of routes that should be bridleways are not recorded as bridleways. All the coastal path is for walkers, not riders.”Thompson and other equestrians have pointed out that riding is a majority female sport, and they think this could be partly why they have been ignored in access to nature discussions.How ministers squashed proposals to expand right to roam in EnglandRead more“There is a very heavy delivery of what I call ‘white man walking’ – it’s middle aged white man walking routes which are being delivered. A lot of women ride. They don’t necessarily own a horse, they borrow a horse. You don’t have to be rich to ride. They don’t want to walk, they don’t want to cycle. They feel safe in the countryside on a horse,” she said.“Equestrianism is largely a female pursuit, a lot of women riders are people like teachers, nurses and social workers. It’s a relief against a lot of the mental problems they have in their jobs.“People have the view that we are all rich toffs but we aren’t – it’s not true any more.”Even for walkers, there is a right to roam over only 8% of England. The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 gives a legal right of public access to mountains, moorland, heaths, some downland and commons, alongside the more recently created England coast path.Campaigners have asked for this to be extended to cover rivers, woods and green belt land. Ninety-seven per cent of rivers are off limits to the public, and tens of thousands of acres of woodland remain publicly inaccessible despite benefiting from public subsidy.Equestrian groups were invited to give evidence to the government’s shelved review into access to green space last year.They were asked alongside groups representing more than 20 million people who are active outdoors, including ramblers, canoeists and mountaineers, to speak to officials from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Treasury.A submission to the review, given to the Guardian after a freedom of information request, shows that horse riders had grave concerns about their access to nature.The document, from the Trails Trust, says: “Equestrians, particularly in the south of England, consider themselves to be unfairly treated and discriminated against by Forestry England. The actions and attitude of this government arms-length body is in sharp contrast to the messages being put out by Natural England that ‘the Countryside is for everyone’.“Equestrian activities are mainly local but mainstream recreational, sporting and green travel activities that are particularly favoured by women, girls, elderly and disabled people. Local forests with gravelled tracks/green rides are ideal for these activities. We are all taxpayers and the government-owned forests belong to us all.”The letter goes on to say that Forestry England sometimes bans riders – but not walkers or cyclists – from its woodlands, and sometimes equestrians have to pay extra costs to use the tracks.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Why is it asking others to improve access without improving its own? It is very difficult for us to access much of government-owned land.“The message to government is get your own house in order and show other landowners what can be done.”Hannah Gardner, who works on the Horse Access Campaign, has written to the government to ask them to include riders in their discussions.She said: “The language from central government is not good, it’s all about walking and cycling when we should be talking about multi-use. It’s not just equestrian, it’s disabled users as well, they are not mentioned at all.“It’s a shame really. In my spare time I’d prefer to be out and about in the countryside rather than writing another letter to the government asking to be included.“In the north of England, access to Forestry England sites is fantastic, but you go into the south-east where the major population is and you have to get a permit and pay to use their woodlands and they insist you have your own insurance. Why do mountain bikers not have to pay for insurance and permits? This is all public land it should be open to everyone.”A Defra spokesperson said: “We engage frequently with a wide range of stakeholders with an interest in public access to nature, including equestrians – and through Farming in Protected Landscapes we have delivered several projects aiming to diversify visitors to green space. We engage regularly with the British Horse Society and the government’s response to the landscape review was accompanied by a public consultation which was open to all and received over 15,000 responses.”A Forestry England spokesperson said: “The nation’s forests have 2,690km (1,670 miles) of public bridleways and byways well-used and enjoyed by many horse riders. On top of that, where we can, we also provide additional access on our forestry roads, on permissive bridleways and to link to other popular routes.“We use permits and permissions in a limited way for horse riding because some places need them and they allow us to have access rather than stop it altogether. For example, it means we can manage the impacts of horse riding in areas with sensitive or protected habitats. The modest amount of money from these permits is channelled back into the woodlands we manage to help maintain trails and other facilities.”",2022-08-12
 Prince Charles: small-scale family farms must be at heart of sustainable future,"Exclusive: ‘Rapid transition to regenerative farming’ needed, says prince, as data reveals 100,000 UK farms lost since 1990

Fewer, bigger, more intensive: EU vows to stem drastic loss of small farms 
Sicily’s prize pigs: can niche farms hold out against mega pork?
","['Supported by', 'About this content', 'Fiona Harvey', ' Environment correspondent']","The Prince of Wales has called for small family farmers in the UK and across the world to come together in a cooperative movement using sustainable farming methods, and for their plight to be at the centre of environmental action.Small farmers, in the UK and EU, are facing their biggest upheavals in more than a generation, with the loss of farm subsidies and new post-Brexit trade deals in the UK, and sweeping reforms to the EU’s common agricultural policy to be announced this week in Brussels.Small farms have a huge role to play in our sustainable future | Charles, Prince of WalesRead moreWriting for the Guardian, Prince Charles has urged small farmers to band together to cope with the coming shocks and shift to a low-carbon economy: “There are small farms the world over which could come together in a global cooperative committed to producing food based on high environmental standards … With the skills of ethical entrepreneurs and a determination from the farmers to make it work, I would like to think it could provide a very real and hopeful future.”Farming is undergoing a “massive transition”, and the needs of family farmers must be taken into account, the prince said.“To me, it is essential the contribution of the small-scale family farmer is properly recognised – they must be a key part in any fair, inclusive, equitable and just transition to a sustainable future. To do this, we must ensure that Britain’s family farmers have the tools and the confidence to meet the rapid transition to regenerative farming systems that our planet demands,” he said.Analysis of farming data for the Guardian has shown that small farmers were already facing an increasingly difficult future, before the shocks of Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic. The EU has lost vast numbers of livestock farms in particular, with 3.4m gone between 2005 and 2016, the latest year for which full data was available.At the same time, the number of livestock on farms has increased on average, a clear sign of intensification in the sector.John and Mary Atkinson on their small-scale farm in Nibthwaite Grange, the Lake District, an area where many farming families have been forced to leave. Photograph: Dom Bush/The GuardianIn the UK, a quarter of livestock farms, amounting to 45,500 farms, were lost in 12 years from 2005 to 2016. That loss was part of a longer-term trend for all farms, with more than 110,000 farms gone from the 319,000 farms in 1990.Many farmers have warned that Brexit could hasten the loss of smaller farms, as the UK’s markets open up to lower-cost imports from outside the EU that previously faced tariffs and other barriers. The government has been phasing in new support for farmers, based on payments for providing public goods such as tree planting, wildlife protection and nurturing the soil, but it is still unclear how these will work in practice.Ministers also announced a consultation last week on giving lump sums to farmers who want to retire, accompanied by support for people who want to enter farming, but cannot afford to. However, some farmers concerned that the scheme will encourage a further exodus of small farmers.The Prince of Wales has long been a supporter of sustainable farming, and earlier this year launched Terra Carta, a roadmap to 2030 for businesses to move towards a low-carbon and environmentally sustainable future. He said this could provide a template for farmers coming together in cooperatives to reach consumers who are increasingly interested in buying locally and from small-scale producers.The good old ways: can we still farm like our grandparents?Read more“These [small] farmers are some of the most hard-working and innovative small businesses and, in so many ways, we depend on them far more than most of us will ever know,” the prince wrote.Minette Batters, president of the National Farmers’ Union, echoed his views: “We would not want to see a loss of the traditional family farm. We would lose the culture and heritage of this country, where 70% of the land is farmed and the expectation is that at the end of every farm track is a family. Our national identity is built on this.”loss of farms amended graphicSmall farmers in the UK are increasingly worried about what Brexit will mean for them, with the government’s approaching trade deal with Australia provoking widespread unease. Many farmers told the Guardian they were alarmed at the impact an influx of cheap meat and other produce could have on small farmers and the British countryside.Liz Lewis, who with her husband, David, farms 650 hectares (1,600 acres) in north Wiltshire, including a beef cattle herd producing 100 calves a year, said: “This will be curtains for small livestock farmers. There’s a lot fewer already. It won’t happen overnight, it will be a slow burn, but in a few years you will see it.”She warned that the UK’s landscape would be transformed, as has happened in the US, into widespread factory farming with a green veneer. “It’s sad for the younger generation – it’s really hard to see how they can make money unless they intensify, by going for big feedlots [of the kind common in the US],” she said. “You have to imagine what the countryside will be like in 10 or 20 years’ time – it will not be what we’re used to. There will be more trees, but behind those trees there will be industrialised farms.”Tim Ashton, in north Shropshire, said the impact of the loss of small farms was already evident, even in the most rural areas. “What we’re seeing around us is social cleansing. Local people can’t afford to live here and small farms are disappearing. There is a lot of gentrification happening – you expect to see that in Cornwall or the Cotswolds but now it’s even coming here.”Pigs per holdingConsumers would also lose out from the decline of small farms, said Ruth Hancock, a self-described “new entrant” who faced many barriers to setting up as a small farmer. She said: “We are at great risk of creating a two-tier food system akin to that in the US, where we may end up having a few smaller or organic producers supplying the concerned and better-off citizen. Meanwhile, the vast majority have to make do with the lowest common denominator imports, because they can’t afford to buy better or don’t understand the difference.”A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “Our landmark plans for a renewed agricultural sector will transform the way we produce food and support farmers in England. Through these changes, rather than paying farmers and landowners for the amount of land they manage, we will pay them to provide environmental and animal health and welfare outcomes. We are phasing out the current subsidy, the basic payment scheme, in a phased and progressive way. This means that initially those who claim smaller amounts of subsidy will receive a smaller reduction in their payments when we make the first reduction later this year.”Research on data for this piece by Kunal SolankySign up here for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

","['Donna Lu', '@donnadlu']","Renewable energy generation hit a new record on Friday, briefly contributing more than two-thirds of the power in Australia’s main grid.According to the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo), the milestone was set at 12.30pm, with a contribution of 68.7%, or 18,882MW, from renewable sources.The figure is 4.6 percentage points higher than the previous record, which was set on 18 September.Of total power in the grid on Friday, 34% came from distributed solar, which outstripped black coal’s contribution of 22%.Victoria pledges nation’s most ambitious renewable energy storage targetsRead moreRenewable penetration rates are measured in 30-minute intervals, and illustrate contributions to the grid within a short period of time.“It’s very different to 100% renewables 24/7,” said Alison Reeve, climate change and energy deputy program director at the Grattan Institute. “Nevertheless, it does show how much the grid is changing.”“Five years ago the maximum that we’d managed to get to was 30%, and five years before that, I don’t know that anyone was even measuring [renewables], it was so small.”

One challenge of the energy transition was managing fluctuating contributions from renewable sources, Reeve said. “Once the solar has dropped out [at night], the percentage that you need to ramp up your non-renewables up to is a lot higher,” she said.“One of the things that is gradually driving particularly coal-fired power plants out of the market at the moment is that they can’t ramp up and down that quickly … they’re not good at switching on and off over a couple of hour periods.”Gas and hydro generators are more responsive at short timescales. Because of high gas prices currently, “when those gas generators come on they set quite a high price in the electricity market,” Reeve said.Hydro generators have recently been limited in their operation because of the wet weather on the east coast of Australia, she added. “They can’t send too much water down the river because they don’t want to make any flooding worse,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This represented a 21% year-on-year drop in price.According to Irena data, the average cost of electricity from utility-scale solar has dropped by 90% in Australia since 2010.",2022-10-31
Country diary: An improbable blend of cocktail lounge and military dowdiness,"Buxton, Derbyshire: Elephant hawkmoths up close are remarkable – but why do I prize the adult stage over any other?",['Mark Cocker'],"I often liken the opening of my moth trap to Christmas morning in childhood: you have no idea what you are about to be gifted. Today, it’s 17 elephant and small elephant hawkmoths, which is more than I’ve ever seen before.The first is an improbable blend of the cocktail lounge and military dowdiness, with shimmering lines of pink over matt olive. If anything, the small elephant hawkmoth is more striking, with the soldier’s khaki replaced by a colour somewhere between aconite yellow and burnt grass. In certain lights, as I arrange them on a sheet beneath the shade of our oak, they look like lipstick on gold.However, there is a curious reflection at work as I proceed, because I always feel – for some reason – an urge to see the adults of any insect species rather than other stage of its life. It’s nagging me because I recently found the larva of a moth called the giant peacock, the largest moth in Europe, which bears exquisite pink-rimmed eyes upon its four enormous wings.An elephant hawkmoth caterpillar. Photograph: Mark CockerAlas, I only saw the caterpillar. I say “alas”, but it was no insignificant beast itself: a florescent lime “finger” studded with yellow warts from which spired thick black bristles. Yet the desire for the adult was undiminished, and I know it’s odd because many insects spend more of their lives as larvae than they do adults.The golden-ringed dragonfly can live several months in its final winged avatar but three years as a voracious pond-dwelling nymph. Stag beetles live as enormous whitish larvae for up to seven years, and some American cicadas spend 17 years underground before emerging for a brief summer of blade-grinding song and breeding. In fact, some adult moths have no mouthparts and only days in which to pass on their genes before they inevitably starve.What is perhaps most remarkable, however, about my elephant hawkmoths, is not one stage or another, but that they start as a pimple-sized eggs on our willowherb, grow by devouring the leaves into silver-eyed worms the size of my pinky and, finally, metamorphose into pink-and-khaki angels to adorn this summer’s morning.

","['Christopher Knaus', ' and ', 'Lisa Cox']","An inquiry into major plans to exploit gas in the Northern Territory’s Beetaloo Basin has recommended the federal government commit to a national plan to offset the vast emissions the project is expected to release.The former Coalition government made gas exploration in the Beetaloo Basin a central tenet of its plans for recovering from the Covid pandemic, using grants and tax breaks to incentivise gas corporates to begin work in the region. The basin covers about 28,000 sq km south-east of Katherine and is thought to contain huge reserves of shale gas.But environmentalists have warned that developing the gas resources in the region will unleash a “carbon bomb” and render Australia unable to meet its emission reductions targets.Northern Territory faces legal challenge over approval of Tamboran drilling and fracking in Beetaloo basinRead moreA Senate inquiry on Wednesday recommended that the government commit to finding a way to offset all scope two and three emissions from the basin. It also recommended establishing a fresh inquiry into the proposed Middle Arm precinct, a petrochemical manufacturing hub, designed to facilitate the expansion of the gas sector in the region.The inquiry also recommended the establishment of a beneficial ownership register to better understand who is behind companies working in the region. That followed evidence to the inquiry that one of the companies, Falcon Oil & Gas, was linked to Russian oligarchs.The inquiry also recommended the expansion of the water trigger in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 to cover all forms of unconventional gas. Water triggers are designed to protect groundwater, but currently the EPBC Act’s water trigger does not apply to the development of shale gas. The Albanese government, as part of its planned reforms to national environmental laws, has proposed expanding the water trigger.The government has supported the inquiry’s recommendations.

The Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young, who chaired the inquiry, described it as a “huge blow to the prospects of gas corporations trying to frack the Beetaloo Basin”.“Labor went to the last election promising to open the Beetaloo Basin, but through this inquiry and our changes to the safeguard mechanism, the Greens are gaining Labor support to put serious roadblocks in the way of the Beetaloo,” she said.A native title holder group in the area, Nurrdalinji Native Title Aboriginal Corporation, said the report showed that development of the basin must stop.Johnny Wilson, the group’s chair, said the report exposed failings in the obtaining of consent from all traditional owners, outside of the Northern Land Council.“We hold big fears that fracking will tear the heart out of our land, damaging water and sacred sites,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

 This article is more than 8 months oldEarth Day climate action organisers promise family-friendly protestsThis article is more than 8 months old,"Coalition of groups behind Big One demonstration intend focus on collective expression, with disobedience on hold","['Bibi van der Zee', ' and ', 'Damien Gayle']","People do not need to glue themselves to anything in order to protest about the climate crisis this weekend, say the organisers of a large-scale planned climate emergency action.The Big One, planned by a coalition of groups brought together by Extinction Rebellion to coincide with Earth Day on Saturday, will be four days of protest and events that they say will be “family friendly” and “engaging”.But XR has also issued two demands: that all licences, approvals and funding for fossil fuel projects must end, and that the UK government must create emergency citizens’ assemblies to lead on fair, long-term solutions. The organisation says the government must engage with the demands by 5pm on Monday, and that if it does not, “unprecedented” civil disobedience will follow.The organisers say the main focus of this weekend, however, is creating a welcoming space for people to come and protest about the climate crisis, with no disruption.“We want to bring people together, to create a space where people feel they can make their voices heard,” said a spokesperson for XR. “This is not going to be about disruption, it’s about bringing more people and more big groups together – unions, social justice groups, environmental groups, some of whom have never worked together before. People don’t need to glue themselves to anything, just come and join us.”There were particular concerns that the London marathon might be interrupted, but the organisers of both events say they have agreed to coexist peacefully, although it is still possible that smaller activist groups or individuals may choose the marathon as a target.Environmental groups in the UK have struggled with a reputation for being dominated by white, middle-class people for a couple of decades, but XR has been partially focused on improving the diversity of the movement in the last few months. The coalition includes unions, environment groups, social justice groups and some businesses; among the signatories are Keep Britain Tidy, Avaaz, Friends of the Earth, Ecotricity, Patagonia and Cafod.On Friday there will be pickets outside various government departments in Westminster, and on Saturday a large family-friendly march is planned. Sunday will see action at the Home Office, and on Monday the groups plan to hold a “What’s Next” assembly.Dave Timms, the head of political affairs at Friends of Earth, said the organisation had been delighted to sign up. “We’ve had huge amounts of interest and enthusiasm from our members and local groups for this. There is a real appetite to get out there.”He said the timing was important, coming in advance of the latest Public Order Act, which has raised huge concerns about the right to protest. “The powers to stop and search that are included in that bill could potentially have a real chilling effect on protest. We need to show we can still get out there in the face of an unprecedented assault on our civil rights,” he said.Jemima Hartshorn, of Mums for Lungs, one of the organisations that has signed up to support the protests, said: “We know that the majority of people feel very passionately and strongly about the climate crisis. And our pollution and health crisis is a microcosm of the climate crisis more broadly – too much transport, not enough biodiversity, burning trees.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

In New Zealand, Restore Passenger Rail, another JSO sister organisation, on Wednesday began a new phase of actions. And in New York City, disruptive climate street protests are expected on Saturday under the banner Rave Revolution.Big protests are also expected in France over the weekend, where Les Soulèvements de la Terre, a federation of environmentalist groups that fought pitched battles with police last month around a new reservoir project, will camp out at the site of a proposed new road project close to Toulouse.",2023-04-20
 ‘Monster’ fatberg blocks Birmingham sewer,"Mass weighing equivalent of 250 cars not expected to be cleared until June, says water company",['Clea Skopeliti'],"Engineers are working around the clock to clear a “monster” fatberg 1km long which is clogging a sewer in Birmingham.The blockage is not expected to be removed until June, water services company Severn Trent said in a statement, adding that the fatberg was about four miles east of the city centre, in Hodge Hill.The mass is thought to weigh about 300 tonnes – equivalent to 250 cars. The water services company was alerted to the stoppage after its sensors detected rising water levels in the sewer.Fatbergs are formed when oil, grease and fat poured down drains combine with non-biodegradable items such as wet wipes, nappies and cotton buds. A previous study revealed that cooking oil is the main contributor, making up nearly 90% of the mass.Severn Trent urged people to be careful about what they flush down toilets to avoid blockages. The company said over the past year it had been alerted to thousands of blockages across the region, three-quarters of which had been caused by people misusing the sewer system.Scott Burgin, Severn Trent operations manager, said: “Our advice is to always leave leftover cooking fat to cool before disposing of it in the bin and to stick to only flushing the three Ps (pee, poo and toilet paper) and bin anything else.Don't feed the fatberg: what not to flushRead more“These relatively small changes can make a big difference and hopefully avoid any future fatbergs.”It is the latest in a series of fatbergs to have been cleared in recent years. One the size of an African elephant was broken up in October 2020. Thames Water removed 140 tonnes of fatbergs from the drains of Greenwich, Pall Mall and the Shard in 2019.Water providers have launched campaigns to combat the waste issue, which is largely caused by incorrect disposal of non-biodegradable items. Thames Water’s “Bin it, don’t block it” campaign says the company is forced to remove about 75,000 blockages from sewers each year.If left uncleared, the blockages can block pipes and push raw sewage back up drains, plugs and toilets. Thames Water says it removes 30 tonnes of “unflushable” material from one of its sites every day.Fatbergs, which are partly a result of the UK’s plastic crisis, have been found to contain potentially deadly antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Experts have said the bacteria not only poses an immediate risk to operatives who work in sewers, but also to the public in the event of flooding caused by a blockage.",2021-05-01
 More than 500 people stung by scorpions flushed out by storms in Egypt,Storms forced scorpions from their hiding places into many houses across the province of Aswan ,['Staff and agencies'],"More than 500 people have been hospitalised by scorpion stings in southern Egypt after storms forced the creatures out of their hiding places and into houses, state-run media has reported.Over the weekend, the province of Aswan was hit by rare downpours, hail and thunder in which three people died, governor Ashraf Attia said. However, those who were stung by scorpions were given anti-venom doses and were later discharged.Acting health minister Khalid Abdel-Ghafar confirmed in a statement that no deaths were reported from scorpion stings.‘It’s like hunting aliens’: inside the town besieged by armadillosRead morePhotos and video footage circulated on social media showed flooded streets and damaged houses, vehicles and agricultural farms. School classes were suspended and power outages were reported across the region. Marine traffic on the Nile was also paused, and roads closed during the storms on Friday before resuming on Saturday.Doctors were recalled from annual leave and hospitals were put on high alert, the Al-Ahram daily reported Ehab Hanafy, the Health Ministry’s undersecretary in Aswan, as saying.The Ministry of Health reassured the public that it had enough anti-venom doses, with more than 3,000 available in Aswan. Extra doses were sent near mountain and desert areas, Hanafy said.Those stung by the scorpions said their symptoms included severe pain, fever, sweating, vomiting, diarrhoea, muscle tremors, and head twitching.The Aswan mountains are home to the Arabian fat-tailed scorpion, or Androctonus crassicauda, which translates from Greek to “man-killer”, Al Jazeera reported. They are considered among the most dangerous scorpions in the world, with a highly toxic venom but cause only several human deaths a year.With Associated Press",2021-11-17
 Thames Water accused of ignoring warnings after hundreds in Surrey endure days without water,Lib Dem councillor calls for company to be fined over the incident,['Matthew Weaver'],"Thames Water has been accused of repeatedly ignoring warnings about cuts to supplies and burst pipes in Surrey where hundreds of households had to endure three days without tap water at the height of this weekend’s heatwave.Residents, including some who were vulnerable, had to queue for bottled water on Saturday in temperatures of well over 30C (86F) after a pump failure at Netley Mill treatment works.By Sunday morning up to 1,000 homes began a third day without water. Supplies were restored to up to 9,000 homes, but many households still complained about low water pressure.Thames Water apologised and confirmed it handed out bottled water to residents in Guildford, Surrey Hills, Dorking and Horsham while engineers worked to restore the supply.‘There’s a nagging fear’: the village that can’t rely on running waterRead moreLiz Townsend, a Liberal Democrat county councillor for Cranleigh and Ewhurst, called for Thames Water to be fined over the incident and said the company had failed to respond to numerous complaints about previous cuts in supplies.“We’re completely exasperated,” she said. “We had a period last summer when there was just bottled water. We had no water in February during the storm, we had no water in the previous hot period at the beginning of July. And now another hot spell and we have no water.“Our water infrastructure is not resilient enough to cope with all the new housing and the ageing pipes. Whenever they increase the pressure in the system, we get more and more bursts. I’ve been having talks with Thames Water for 10 years, and I’ve been up Westminster several times to raise it, but nobody takes any notice.”Townsend wrote to Sarah Bentley, the chief executive of Thames Water, in July after a previous interruption in supply. The letter, seen by the Guardian, accused the company of taking months, and in some cases years, to repair burst pipes and said it reneged on a public commitment to provide residents with updates on water supplies.Bentley has yet to respond.A statement from Thames Water said: “Netley Mill water treatment works is now back in service and supply is gradually being restored to the local network. This will continue over the remainder of the day. We are very sorry that customers have been impacted especially at a time of high temperatures.“When supplies do begin to return, we are asking customers to try to use this just for essential use initially. This will help us return supplies to everyone quicker. We are supplying bottled water to customers who we know need additional help. If anyone is unable to travel to a bottled water site they should contact us on 0800 316 9800 and we will provide assistance.”Cranleigh is the latest village to run out of water after an official drought was declared in eight areas of England. Dozens of households in Northend, Oxfordshire have been reliant on just bottled water for the last five days.Townsend said: “There was no water on Saturday for [between] 8,000 and 9,000 homes. We have got a trickle this morning. But between 500 and 1,000 households are still without water.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She said some vulnerable people on the priority list were not sent bottled water, and farmers had no water for livestock.She added: “There should be financial penalties. If they are not delivering water, people should get refunds. We have thousand and thousands of new houses coming into this area, and yet the basic water infrastructure cannot cope now with the existing number of houses.”Townsend also called for failing water companies to be renationalised.“It is such a precious and reducing resource that perhaps we should be looking at having more of a public ownership model for water,” she said.Three water companies – Welsh Water, Southern Water, and South East Water – have all imposed hosepipe bans, while Yorkshire Water has announced that a ban will start on 26 August, and Thames Water is planning one in the coming weeks.An amber weather warning for extreme heat remained in place on Sunday for large parts of the south, east, west, Midlands and north of England for a fourth day.",2022-08-15
 What if it’s too late to save our planet without geoengineering?Moira Donegan,"Climate engineering sounds scary. But is coming whether we like it or not, this scientist says",,"The realities of climate change are front-page news every day. Temperature records are being smashed. Wildfires are raging. There is no sign of things going back to “normal”. If anything, they will only get worse.Last year, when the planet was convulsing with the arrival of a pandemic, we pinned our hopes on technology – in the form of an mRNA vaccine – getting us out of our crisis. The vaccine was a technological intervention, injected into the arms of billions of people. Could we (should we?) look to technological solutions to our climate crisis, too?‘Fire weather’: dangerous days now far more common in US west, study findsRead moreThis is the question posed by Holly Jean Buck in her 2019 book, After Geoengineering: Climate Tragedy, Repair, and Restoration. Zooming with me from Buffalo, New York, where she’s a professor of environment at the University of Buffalo, Buck is blunt in her assessment. The pace of climate change, and the insufficiency of humanity’s current response, have effectively already made the choice for us: mankind will have to engage in some kind of “geoengineering” – an umbrella term for various methods of intentional, planetary-scale climate intervention – whether we like it or not.Geoengineering refers to any number of ways that humans can change our climate through interventions. The two main types of geoengineering are carbon engineering, which aims to suck carbon out of the atmosphere, and solar engineering, which aims to reflect solar energy away from Earth.“We’re in a climate crisis,” she tells me. “Mitigation isn’t going fast enough. Adaptation needs far more support than it’s getting. It’s clear that we need to remove some amount of carbon from the atmosphere.”How much? “Hundreds of billions of tons,” Buck says. “We have emitted so much, and now we have so much legacy carbon. The challenge isn’t just cutting emissions.” The second challenge is “removing the carbon that’s up there. It’s this massive cleanup operation that we need to undertake this century.”The idea of deliberately altering the climate can be frightening and distasteful, including to many environmentalists. But Buck argues that climate engineering is coming whether we like it or not. “If people on the environmental left – people who care about climate change – just reject all of these approaches out of hand, then we lose the ability to shape them, which would be a grave mistake,” she says.The simplest form of geoengineering is the kind of carbon removal many of us learned about in school: planting trees. “Land-based solutions are really important, especially in the next decade or so, because they can be implemented quickly – and we know how to plant forests,” Buck says. She points to other kinds of land-based climate interventions that show promise. Changing agricultural practices can be used to store more carbon in the dirt. Other strategies include storing carbon in wetlands, ocean iron fertilization, or different approaches involving rock weathering.But land-based solutions, though a helpful beginning, probably won’t be enough, Buck says. To plant enough trees to soak up enough carbon to sufficiently cool our planet, we would have to fundamentally change the way we use land in ways that would make our economy and many of our lives unrecognizable. And there are other risks to relying too heavily on land-based techniques.“A lot of land-based approaches are vulnerable to climate change itself,” Buck explains. “You don’t want a wildfire to wipe out these removals that you’ve been banking on, right?” Massive reforestation efforts could go up in smoke.But land-based solutions are not the only option. Carbon removal can also be accomplished with industrial technologies. Buck points to a carbon mitigation strategy called geological carbon capture, which is already widely used to reduce the emissions of heavily polluting industries. “You could outfit, well, scrubbers basically, on a factory, and these collect carbon dioxide. Then you inject [the carbon] underground, into a cavern, and keep it there, under the rock, for a very long time. You keep monitoring it, to make sure it stays where you want it to be.”There are risks to injecting large amounts of carbon into rock; Buck laments the under-regulated “wild west atmosphere” of fracking, which caused earthquakes in some parts of the US. But scientists have learned from that experience, and technologies exist to keep underground carbon in place. And new techniques may make geological carbon capture safer. “There’s a lot of new research about how to get carbon dioxide to turn into rock quicker once you inject it” underground, Buck says.This is a carbon mitigation technique that has proved efficient in reducing emissions at an industrial scale, and it has been in use for decades, meaning that the safety and science of the technique are well understood. Buck’s hope is that this technology could advance and be used not just for mitigating carbon emissions, but for removing carbon.“It becomes carbon removal” – as opposed to mitigation – “if you’re removing the carbon just from the ambient air,” Buck says. There are now machines that can “scrub” carbon out of the air; the carbon can then be transported and stored underground. Without these machines, the technique can also be used to create bioenergy, which involves “producing biomass” – say, a very carbon-dense type of plant – “and combusting it at a power plant, and separating out the carbon and storing it underground again”.This strategy – using a spectrum of carbon-engineering techniques to inject carbon deep beneath rock - is the most effective and safest, Buck believes. But unless humanity gets its act together soon, we may forced to entertain much riskier climate mitigation strategies. “If we don’t remove carbon, and decarbonize, and reform how we use land, and rework our transportation systems, and change industrial systems fast enough,” Buck says, “then there’s the possibility that people will pitch the idea of solar geoengineering.”Solar geoengineering is a kind of climate mitigation – thus far theoretical – that involves “blocking a fraction of incoming sunlight and sending it back out into space, which has a cooling effect”. Most solar-engineering techniques involve using special planes to inject gas into the stratosphere. The gas particles would reflect sunlight away, changing both the quantity and the quality of sunlight that reaches earth.This kind of geoengineering would certainly cool the planet, at least for a while. But it would not solve the fundamental problem of too much carbon in the atmosphere. “It doesn’t get to the root,” says Buck. “It doesn’t remove emissions. It’s just a blanket of intentional pollution that cools things down.”And solar geoengineering might create other problems, Buck says. What would a different kind of sunlight do to humankind, or to other living creatures? What would it do to agriculture, and our food supply? We don’t know. Would there be food shortages? Would the sky still be blue? We don’t have those answers, and solar geoengineering remains a risky proposition until we do.How optimistic is Buck that humanity will attain a livable future without having to resort to solar geoengineering? More than I expected. The vision that she articulates is ambitious. It would require international cooperation and vast overhauls of infrastructure. It would also mean that the United States and other capitalist countries would have to reorient themselves to a more centrally planned economy, devoted less to maximizing growth than to minimizing carbon. It would mean overcoming vast political differences and competing incentives the world over in order to unite in global common cause.But Buck thinks that the incentives for cooperation in the existential climate intervention project are great enough to ensure at least some success.“I do think that if people share a common goal, they might disagree about how to reach that goal, but maybe just having the common goal is enough,” she says.The greatest cleanup operation of history – the cleanup of carbon in our atmosphere – may well happen within our lifetimes. And, if Buck is right, there is no better time to start it than right now. This article was amended on 1 September 2021. When answering the question about how much carbon needed to be removed from the atmosphere, Buck meant to say hundreds of billions of tons, not hundreds of billions of gigatons as quoted in an earlier version.

LettersThe UN food systems summit will consider all stakeholders’ interests,Dr Agnes Kalibata responds to a report on the 2021 summit that she is leading as a special envoy for the UN secretary general,"['Supported by', 'About this content', 'Letters']","As you note in your article (Farmers and rights groups boycott food summit over big business links, 4 March), farmers have for too long been on the fringes of global discussions about hunger, poverty and climate change, despite being the frontline of our food systems and the custodians of our natural resources.The UN food systems summit marks a momentous opportunity for farmers, producers and many others who support them to be at the heart of the year-long consultative process that has been launched to improve our shared food system.Across the groups leading the five work streams underpinning the summit, around a third are farmer and civil society organisations, the rest are comprised of academia, researchers, government representatives and youth organisations. Agro-ecology, indigenous knowledge and human rights are central to the summit’s work with leading experts including Olivier De Schutter – whose concerns about the summit, referred to in your article, date from a year ago – and Michael Fakhri, the special rapporteur, who has been leading the summit’s human rights lever of change since last summer.While private sector engagement is important to create a momentum of change, there is no agribusiness leading any work or singularly responsible for defining summit outcomes. All doors are open for anyone to contribute through Action Tracks public forums, food systems summit dialogues, and the community platform.The entire purpose of the summit is to embrace not only the shared interests of all stakeholders but also – importantly – the areas of divergence on how we go about addressing the harsh reality humanity faces.

Somalia suffered the worst of the flooding, with 50 people reported dead. According to the Somali disaster management agency almost 700,000 people have been forced to leave their homes.Across east Africa a total of 130 people have died because of the flooding. The town of Beledweyne in Somalia was badly affected as the Shabelle River burst its banks, destroying many homes. According to Save the Children, an estimated 250,000 people (about 90% of Beledweyne’s population) were forced out of their homes. The flooding is expected to continue to affect east Africa with the UN warning that 4.3 million people (a quarter of Somalia’s population) are at risk of “crisis-level hunger or worse”.Turkey is dealing with the aftermath of a severe storm and flooding that affected the country on 18 and 19 November. The storm was responsible for the sinking of the Turkish-flagged cargo ship Kafkametler, which sank off the Black Sea coast. The ship struck a breakwater outside the harbour near the town of Ereğli, leaving 11 crew members missing. The ship had already sustained damage in October after it struck a mine off the coast of Romania. The search and rescue operation was delayed for several hours due to the severe weather, but the body of the ship’s cook was found after conditions eased. Another ship, registered in Cameroon, broke in two due to the storm after all its crew had been safely evacuated.Rescue and relief efforts continue across multiple provinces, with large-scale damage reported to people’s homes and infrastructure, including roofs blown off, fallen trees and flooding.

",['Dwayne Grant'],"The fate of one of northern New South Wales’s most popular walking tracks remains uncertain after authorities chose to delay a controversial decision regarding its future for the fourth time.Situated near the flood-hit town of Murwillumbah, Wollumbin national park previously attracted more than 100,000 visitors a year, and its summit is renowned as the first place in Australia to catch the sunrise.Formerly known as Mount Warning national park, it was initially closed in March 2020 due to Covid-19 restrictions, but has never reopened as the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service undertakes an assessment on safety and cultural grounds.NSW national park to be renamed due to Ben Boyd’s links to slave trade in mid-1800sRead moreThe hiking trail was to remain closed until May 2021 after public safety risks were flagged with infrastructure that helps climbers reach the summit. However, that deadline was extended to July and then November, before last year being pushed back to 31 March 2022.On Friday, the national park’s website was again updated to indicate the closure would stretch into a third year.“[The national park] remains closed until the end of June 2022 due to the impacts of widespread flooding in the region and to allow further consultation with the Aboriginal community and other key stakeholders about the future management of the site,” the website reads.Guardian Australia has requested comment from NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service.The upper reach of Wollumbin was declared an Aboriginal place in 2014, with a sign at the start of the trail asking visitors to reconsider their climb out of respect for its spiritual significance to the local Bundjalung people.A Wollumbin Consultative Group spokesperson told the ABC in 2019 the mountain was considered a sacred place.“Only selected men could go on to the mountain for higher level initiation,” they said. “It is a dangerous spiritual place for women.”In the wake of the 2019 ban on people scaling Uluru in the Northern Territory, advocates for being allowed to climb Wollumbin fear a similar fate awaits.

 This article is more than 5 months oldLabour urged to work with Tories to counter ‘ignorant’ climate policy attacksThis article is more than 5 months old,Tory former minister and chair of Climate Change Committee condemns ‘absolutely unacceptable’ attacks on Labour stance,"['Fiona Harvey', ' Environment editor']","Labour should counter “absolutely unacceptable” and “ignorant” Conservative attacks on its climate policies by offering a cross-party consensus on climate action, to bring forward measures this parliament to meet net zero, the outgoing chair of the Climate Change Committee has urged.Lord Deben, a former Tory environment secretary and minister under Margaret Thatcher and John Major, strongly criticised Grant Shapps and Suella Braverman, cabinet ministers who have led vitriolic attacks on Labour as “the political wing of Just Stop Oil”. He called on the government instead to heed the message of climate protesters.“The government doesn’t seem to understand what it has done,” he said of ministers’ attacks. “That’s a much worse position [than hypocrisy]. We still get things like the absolutely unacceptable statement by Suella Braverman attacking the Labour party and talking about their very proper decision about not further expanding exploitation and extraction from the North Sea, and branding it as being outrageous and disgraceful.”Deben, who was known as John Gummer before he was made a peer in 2010, continued: “It is ignorant to say that. It is ignorant, not least, of their official advisers who have proposed exactly that [an end to new North Sea licences], and it has to be taken seriously. You may disagree with it, but it has to be taken seriously and not used as a kind of cheap political barb.”Grant Shapps, the energy and net zero secretary, has also posted a series of videos on social media calling Labour the “political wing of Just Stop Oil” and ridiculing Keir Starmer’s stance on climate policy. Deben said these attacks were also “unacceptable”.“I don’t think it is helpful to use the issues of climate change for party political purposes,” he said in an interview with the Guardian. “As chairman of the Climate Change Committee, I have stamped down every time that people tried to do that. I’ve been particularly tough with the Tories when they’ve tried to do that, because it’s just not acceptable.”Deben left his position as chair of the CCC, the statutory committee that advises the government on the impact of its climate policies, earlier this month after a nine-month extension to his 10-year term. His successor is expected to be appointed in November, after an interim period in which Prof Piers Forster, a prominent climate scientist, will act as chair.Deben called on Labour to provide more detail on its policies, and to react to Tory attacks by extending an offer of a cross-party consensus on climate issues. He suggested this could be based on a report published earlier this year by Chris Skidmore, a Tory former energy minister.Skidmore, at the behest of Liz Truss while she was prime minister, compiled a report with 130 recommendations for ministers to put the UK on track to achieve net zero, but only a handful of his proposals have been taken up by the government.“If I were leader of the Labour party at this moment, I know exactly what I’d do,” said Deben. “I would say to the current government: ‘Here is Mr Skidmore’s report, he is a Conservative ex-minister, he was asked to do this report to show how best to deliver net zero by Lis Truss. Now we will accept, if you put it forward, we will do the following basic things [acting on the report’s recommendations]. We will do that. We won’t oppose it. You put them forward, we’ll back it.’”Such an offer would force the government to react, Deben said. “It seems to me that you then start shifting the whole debate,” he said. “The more that you can do cross-party things the better – the more that you celebrate the fact that Britain has this unusual circumstance that all major political parties are united in their desire to go for net zero.”Challenging the government to a cross-party slate of actions could also help to put the UK back on track to reach net zero. The CCC has warned of major failures from the current government, saying the UK is lagging well behind its targets and needs to act immediately or face much higher costs for reaching net zero in future. “We can’t lose the 18 months between now and a general election,” Deben said.Deben, one of the country’s most influential politicians on the climate, also criticised Labour for a lack of clarity over its policies. He said there were elements and key supporters of the Labour party, including trade unions, that objected to climate policy.“They haven’t been precise enough, they haven’t used their position to make the government understand why these things have not been right,” he said. “[From Labour] it’s almost always been generalities, which is why I was very pleased when they did make that absolute commitment on North Sea oil. We do [need to see more precise commitments].”Deben also expressed some sympathy with climate protesters, though he condemned some of their actions. “I’m very strongly against things which upset people’s lives and are dangerous. That’s entirely wrong. But I don’t mind when people are trying to bring home to the nation that this is an urgent existential threat,” he said.For that reason, the response from Braverman and other ministers had been inadequate, he said. “I’ve been a supporter of having tough measures to keep the peace. But you’re only genuinely allowed to do that if you’ve also taken onboard that the reason people are doing what they’re doing is a serious reason. I want to hear ministers being much more sympathetic about the fact that there are many, many young people who know that in their lifetimes, their lives will be impossible unless we act.”Braverman had also failed to take onboard the link between the climate crisis and migration, he added. “If you have temperatures of 50C in places like Niger, people will move. They won’t move to get a better life, they’ll move because there’s no other way of living. We’re already seeing it,” he said. “People have got to come to terms with what happens if you don’t act.”Deben dismissed the idea that the Tories were waging a culture war, however. “I don’t think it’s just my party – I think it’s a real issue about the kind of decisions we have to make,” he said. “When the Labour party announced its decision [to halt new oil and gas licences in the North Sea] it was immediately attacked by two of its biggest funders, Unite and the GMB.”He added: “There are those who don’t really take onboard the urgency of climate change, and they are in all political parties.”",2023-07-26

","['Supported by', 'About this content', 'Tom Plevey']","Residents of Gunnedah on the New South Wales Liverpool Plains are appalled by the lack of preparation, warnings and response from authorities to Sunday’s Namoi River flood, as they brace for another deluge.Julie Shields, who lives on the north-west end of Bloomfield Street, started the Gunnedah Flood Information and Support Facebook group last December, after being disappointed in the response to Gunnedah’s November 2021 flood.On the Saturday before this week’s flood, she said: “I heard the SES was door-knocking, but we didn’t see them once.”“The only time I saw them was Saturday afternoon, they stopped up from our house in a ute.“They didn’t get out and ask, ‘Are you all right?’ – they just turned around and left.”‘Volunteer flexibly’: encouraging Australia’s millennial mud army to stick aroundRead moreShields lives with her mother, Kim Shields, who has been tracking local flood levels ever since she experienced her first flood, a month after moving to Gunnedah in 1984.Kim Shields knows that if the Namoi River levels reach 7.5 metres, their block will be flooded. This week’s flood peaked at 8.16 metres on Sunday morning.“We had our first flood in July 1984,” she said. “And from then I thought, well, I’ll write down what’s happened.”

The Shields criticised Water NSW for what they said was poor and inaccurate information on stored water levels, as well as keeping the upstream Keepit Dam at capacity even after the last flood.Guardian Australia searched Water NSW’s real-time data page on 20 September and found Keepit Dam’s capacity was showing as 101% on Saturday 17 September.“We probably need to look into Water NSW first; the handling of dams, why they need to keep them at 100%,” Julie Shields said.Julie and Kim Shields at the spot where Julie came on Friday to inspect the rising river level before putting an alert on her Facebook group. Photograph: Tom PleveyIn a statement, Water NSW said it “had reduced Keepit Dam to 96.6% of capacity in preparation for the larger-than-forecast rain event expected last Thursday, even with continued inflows from previous rainfall”, saying releases did not exceed 30GL/day while taking inflow of 45GL/day.According to Water NSW, it continued releases during this week’s flood, but its modelling shows 70% of the 102GL/day flow at Gunnedah came from “naturally occurring downstream tributaries”, and it said it is working the with Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) to monitor weather and project dam inflows.Julie Shields wanted to restart the conversation on Gunnedah getting a levee system, a plan that has been discussed since 2000. Downstream Wee-Waa, with its existing levee, was comparatively unaffected by the floods.“We only need half a levee just to hug the river,” she said, adding it could direct flood waters to uninhabited areas around the town’s sale yards.Erin and Michael Edmunds live on Talibah Street and were stranded for four days without running water during the November floods. Michael Edmunds, a full-time carer to two intellectually disabled sons, was livid the SES acting deputy zone command, Craig Ronan, told regional newspaper the Northern Daily Leader that no homes had been affected on Sunday.The Edmunds’ house had a small amount of water in a front room, but a house in town belonging to another family member was inundated.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to The Rural NetworkFree newsletterSubscribe to Calla Wahlquist's fortnightly update on Australian rural and regional affairsEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Like, they ignored us after the last flood, didn’t give us accurate information.”The Leader later edited the article after being contacted by the Edmunds, and issued an apology.Michael said the SES drove down their street and issued a warning to two neighbours, both in elevated houses, but didn’t warn his family or other residents.“They didn’t come here,” he said. “They drove down to the street here, turned around and went back to town.”‘Bigger and better than ever’: Australia’s rural shows bounce back after tough yearsRead moreErin said she called the SES hotline and was told they were not at risk.The Edmunds are still waiting on assistance promised to them for the November floods when the water in their house was “knee high”, but state efforts seem to be focused on Lismore, they say, and the $1,000 assistance payment only applies to floods after February 2022.NSW SES western zone commander, chief Supt David Monk, said the SES has been providing support to the Gunnedah community throughout the current flood, with volunteers door-knocking, sandbagging and responding to all requests for assistance.“Since the last storm season, NSW SES has implemented a number of improvements,” a spokesperson said.“The NSW SES has trained additional incident management personnel and has increased its surge capacity for call taking during emergencies.“The NSW SES is undertaking a transition to the new nationwide Australian warning system, bringing the agency in line with a nationally consistent framework for emergency warnings.”The Shields and Edmunds families are braced for further flooding, with the BoM predicting a 100% chance of rain on Wednesday.

" You might expect Conservatives to resist workers’ rights, but Labour? Only the Greens stand with strikersZack Polanski",We understand that higher wages would help with both the cost of living crisis and the climate crisisZack Polanski is the deputy leader of the Green party of England and Wales,,"The Green party understands, and has long understood, that the climate crisis and the cost of living crisis are interlinked. Our economy isn’t currently working for people, or the planet, when it could and should be doing both.People are getting desperate. They can see the world is changing around them but don’t often feel as if they’re included in the conversation. We’ve seen that over the past few months as people have started to organise during the joint hottest summer on record.When wages are low but profits are high, it’s pretty easy to see what’s going wrong. A small group of people at the top are taking a massively disproportionate share. And while these people are free to pollute more and more, the poorest are pushed even deeper into poverty. Twelve years of Tory rule means that whether you’re a nurse, someone with a job on the railways or a postal worker, you’ve felt undervalued and been underpaid. The work has got harder, faster and more demanding, while the monetary compensation and the working conditions have failed to keep up for most of us.This needs to be rebalanced. Higher wages create a more equal society where everyone can have a decent standard of living without pushing the planet off a cliff. A higher wage economy is a greener economy.There are so many solutions available but unexplored, from investing in renewables to insulating homes. We need a windfall tax on the dirty profits of fossil fuels, and to close the gaps in the government’s plans that simply further support oil and gas companies. The Green party will bring back the £20 universal credit uplift – and double it – while making the long-term case for a universal basic income.Sadly, real solutions to people’s actual problems play second fiddle to grandstanding and distraction. The government would rather create scapegoats out of trans people or migrants than face up to its own systemic failures. With her half-hearted energy bills freeze, Liz Truss is offering a sticking plaster for ordinary people while handing over sacks of public money to the fossil fuel giants with no strings attached. And when it comes to workers, the government still wheels out tired old phrases like “get round the negotiating table” while suggesting it may further erode workers’ ability to organise, strike and protest.You’d expect this from the Tories, but even Labour has been hesitant about backing unions standing up for their members, and eager to discipline its MPs who join picket lines. This smacks of opportunism and grasping for power without any real desire for change. Backing striking workers who face real cuts to their pay and conditions is an essential part of standing in solidarity with those facing the terrible hardships that the cost of living crisis is creating. All workers deserve decent pay and to feel we can do our jobs safely and to the best of our ability, but ask any nurse, cleaner or barrister at the moment and they’ll tell you that’s not their current reality.Both parties are deeply out of touch with what people are feeling in this country. The mood now is one of absolute frustration and anger, balanced by a growing sense of genuine solidarity. The reality is that the public backs the workers, and accepts the inconveniences that will inevitably be brought upon us by strike action. A recent YouGov poll found 64% support for nurses taking strike action, while another poll found more people supporting the rail strikes than opposing them when the reasons for strike action were explained to them.It’s not acceptable for Keir Starmer to say that governments in waiting don’t join picket lines. Being able to listen and understand people’s concerns is a vital part of public service. The Green party knows that when these workers ask for support, the only real response is solidarity.We talk about intersectionality not because it’s a cool new buzzword, but because genuine systemic change based at the heart of communities and standing in solidarity with each other is the only way to truly tackle the climate emergency and to make our society fairer.A higher wage economy is a green economy, and the Green party will always stand side by side with people who face economic, social and environmental struggles. Last year, I campaigned with migrant care workers in north London to secure a living wage. Standing with working people on picket lines in the snow is only the tip of the iceberg of what it takes to succeed. We will be there for meetings and negotiations, and will be pushing for legislative change.This new government will try to crush our wave of solidarity, and the official opposition looks as if it might just let it happen. Town by town, city by city, it’s up to ordinary people to come together and support one another, just as we did during the last crisis. Together, we can weather this storm, and win a better world on the other side.

","['Ben Smee', '@BenSmee']","Queensland authorities have blocked Clive Palmer’s plans to build a large coal-fired power station on an outback cattle property, citing climate impacts and rejecting his company’s claims it would be “carbon neutral”.In its decision notice about the proposed 1.4GW power station proposal, the Queensland Department of Environment and Science said economic and employment impacts were outweighed by climate concerns, and that it was inconsistent with “the right to life”.Palmer’s company, Waratah Coal, had argued it could use carbon credits, carbon offsets, carbon capture and storage technology and biomass to make the proposal “carbon neutral”.NSW minerals lobby advertising blitz doesn’t come clean on the dirty realities of coalmining | Temperature CheckRead moreThe department questioned whether those claims were viable.“The feasibility and timeframe for approval of CCS as a greenhouse gas abatement measure for this project cannot be determined; the feasibility of supplementing coal with biomass cannot be determined; and the feasibility of carbon offsets is not certain.”In any case, the department said Waratah Coal had “not sought approval” for CCS or biomass burning to be used as a mitigation measure for the project.

The plan was to build a 1.4GW power station on a cattle property near the mining town of Alpha in the Galilee Basin.Initially Waratah Coal lodged a development application for the $3.5bn plant with the Barcaldine regional council, rather than the Queensland government. In 2021 the state exercised “call in” power to assess the project.The company has had approval since 2013 to build a 40m tonne coalmine 30km north of Alpha – population 335 – and 450km west of Rockhampton. It has taken no steps to begin mining.The Department of Environment and Science said the coal power station, if approved, would be the among the 100 biggest carbon polluters in Australia and the second-largest source of scope one emissions in Queensland. Based on 2019 figures, it would increase the state’s emissions by about 5.73%.“The project will emit greenhouse gas emissions through the combustion of coal which is known to cause climate change, for which the science is regarded as having reached a state of sufficient certainty as to its fundamentals,” the decision notice says.“Therefore, in the absence of surety of a carbon neutral proposal, the department considers the power station will contribute to longer-term and cumulative global climate change impacts.’skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

" Better air in lockdown may have saved hundreds of lives in Europe, study finds","London and Paris among cities with highest number of avoided deaths thanks to lower pollution in first lockdown

Coronavirus – latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage
",['PA Media'],"More than 800 lives may have been saved across Europe thanks to better air quality in the first phase of Covid lockdowns, research suggests.Measures brought in to stem the rise in infections resulted in far fewer cars and lorries on roads, which had the biggest impact on reducing deaths, according to the study led by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).Analysis of 47 European cities found Paris, London, Barcelona and Milan were among the top six with the highest number of avoided deaths. The study noted that closing workplaces and schools in European cities reduced levels of air pollution through less traffic and movement, while public events were cancelled and people stayed at home.This led to less nitrogen dioxide (NO2) polluting the air, with Spanish, French and Italian cities experiencing the biggest decreases in NO2 of 50% to 60% during the period.Although strong decreases in NO2 were found, there was a smaller drop in levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), which are also produced by natural sources – such as wildfires and dust – and other emissions.Antonio Gasparrini, a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at LSHTM and senior author of the study, said: “The lockdown during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic created immense health and social costs. However, it has offered unique conditions to investigate potential effects of strict policies to reduce pollution levels in urban areas.“This ‘natural experiment’ has given us a glimpse of how air quality can be improved by drastic public health measures that would be difficult to implement in normal times. The information can be important to design effective policies to tackle the problem of pollution in our cities.”The research, published in Nature’s Scientific Reports journal, was funded by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts on behalf of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service. It compared government policies from the 47 European cities from February to July 2020 and estimated the changes in pollution levels and number of deaths.Rochelle Schneider, an honorary assistant professor in geospatial data science at LSHTM and first author of the study, said: “This, and other similar studies, can help drive the message that we definitely need to improve urban air quality for human health, and for the environment.“Government policies decided during the spring and early summer of 2020 gave us a unique opportunity to study a ‘real-life’ scenario with lower air pollution levels.”",2022-01-26
 This article is more than 9 months oldWhy worry about an import ban on hunting trophies when you can bag one at home?This article is more than 9 months oldCatherine Bennett,"British stalkers say they are helping nature, but still celebrate the bloody slaughter",[],"An alliance that brought together conservationists, African leaders, taxidermists, recreational hunters and the patron saint of upskirters, Christopher Chope MP, is recovering, its protests having last week failed to prevent the progress of Henry Smith’s hunting trophies (import prohibition) bill towards enactment.These trophies being – incomprehensibly for anyone whose love of animals does not express itself in killing them – the dead animal’s body parts, brought home for display or sale. A recent US Humane Society investigation at a Safari Club International convention found, for instance, “elephant skin luggage sets ranging from $10,000 to $18,000 and jewellery made from leopard claws”.What is never explained is why, if the hunters are so passionate about animals, they look so exultant after killing themAlthough the new UK law will not stop recreational killers hoping to shoot, say, a bull elephant (available via the UK’s Prostalk African Safaris website for £13,550.00), it is just not the same, you gather, without souvenirs of the corpse to impress friends, or turn into luggage – or jackets, or bags. Even an ear, for the frustrated trophy lover, is better than nothing.Some years ago Martin Amis coined the expression “species shame”: there’s nothing like a tour of hunting company websites, with their price lists and photographs of exultant goons who’ve arranged dead animals into submissive poses, for bringing it repeatedly to mind.But even these enthusiasts seem sufficiently sensate to realise that they are not its finest advocates. Rather, they trust in African leaders and conservationists to redefine their wildlife killings as a conservation tool, rehearsing the contested case that recreational hunting (and any related body-part acquisition) is a crucial contribution to biodiversity and, by helping to fund anti-poaching patrols, animal protection. Though what is never explained is why, if the hunters are so passionate about animals, they always look so thrilled after killing them.Discussions before Smith’s private member’s bill featured some energetic, impassioned attempts to explain that encouraging the worst of humanity to kill the most beautiful of animals is somehow ethical. Ideally, it may even, the argument goes, benefit local communities.Understandably, to some of those at the receiving end, UK tellings-off echoed earlier versions of imperialist control. “What on earth do they know about Africa’s animals, and what right do they have to interfere in our democracies?” Maxi Louis, the director of a coalition of conservation groups in Namibia, objected in a letter to the Times.Anyway, it would certainly be appreciated, at least by some of us, if African politicians, conservationists and influencers were now to return the compliment with a reminder, perhaps via a round robin in the Times, that the persistence of recreational hunting is a stain on the UK. Few visitors from Africa may wish to return home with the skin or teeth of something that they legally slaughtered in Britain but that seems no reason for African equivalents of Joanna Lumley, Richard Curtis and Liam Gallagher not to reproach indigenous hunters who persist in pretending blood sport is conservation, or, for its artier exponents, a Ted Hughes-style communion between man and beast.Supporting the proposed ban on trophy imports, Sir Ranulph Fiennes wrote last week that “killing animals for entertainment and mementoes is something straight out of the darkest Middle Ages. It is moronic, medieval mindlessness. And it is about as un-British as you can get.” It’s mystifying, then, that killing animals for entertainment should be so remarkably well-tolerated in Britain, the hobbyists’ excuses generally coming, as with trophies, from the Cruella de Vil school of conservation management.Genuine animal lovers would be, as ethics studies have suggested, regretful about their butchery. They would not, as the amateur slaughterman David Cameron has done, confidently joke about it: “I find when I shoot a few Borises and Michaels I feel a whole lot better.”Nobody who respects animals would want to pose triumphantly with their kill or boast about body counts. But contributions to UK sporting publications consistently dwell on the hunter’s endurance (in outwitting a supposedly wily prey) followed by creepily orgiastic joy. This month, in the pages of one journal, we find a “retired financier” ecstatically recalling one outdoorsy abattoir – “unadulterated bliss of the most chaotic kind”.Aspiring hunters should not get too downcast about the Tory MP Anna Firth’s statement in the trophy-banning debate that “trophy hunting is a relic of the past, it has no place in modern Britain”. Because if you don’t mind getting a bit of antler instead of elephant, you can book a stalking slot today. Training courses are available from the British Deer Society, patron King Charles III.A bloody digression in Prince Harry’s Spare could go some way to explaining why the UK’s recreational hunters can still flourish in a nation of alleged animal lovers: we just love our royals more.True, the royals don’t go in for elephant skin luggage, and they probably have enough deer heads alreadyTurning 15, Harry was told he’d “be undertaking the true stalker initiation” and sent to execute a deer. In enjoying this he appears, for once, no different from his family. After its death (“I felt swelling pride”), his head was shoved in the entrails.“This ‘blood facial’ was, to me, baptismal,” he says. “If you loved Nature, Pa always said, you had to know when to leave it alone and when to manage it, and managing meant culling, and culling meant killing. It was all a form of worship.”What with all the land, there’s so much relentless royal managing that poor William was also run off his feet keeping the partridges sustainable; we know qualified deer assassins were so thin on the ground that before Kate Middleton was engaged, her parents had to be pressed into service. At one point, even Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein were required in Sandringham for a “straightforward shooting weekend”, helping out with Nature.True, the royals don’t, like reviled US trophy collectors, go in for elephant skin luggage, and they probably have enough deer heads already. From the hunted animal’s point of view it may not make much difference. Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist",2023-03-19

","['Sarah Martin', ' Chief political correspondent', '@msmarto']","The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has released the government’s plan to reach net zero emissions by 2050, and announced the country is on track to beat its 2030 target, as he prepares to fly to Glasgow for a United Nations climate summit.Morrison hailed Tuesday’s plan as a “practical way” to neutralise Australia’s emissions by 2050 but the plan showed almost a third of the abatement task is comprised of cuts via unspecified “technology breakthroughs” and “global trends” while a further 20% will be achieved through offsets.New energy department projections suggest Australia could reduce emissions by 30-35% by 2030 but following internal resistance from members of the National party – who are in a coalition with the conservative Liberal party – the federal government won’t change its formal 2030 target of a 26-28% cut compared to 2005 levels which was set in 2015.Australia’s emissions are among the highest in the world on a per capita basis and the country has long trailed behind similar developed countries in pledging to reduce emissions.The government has refused to release modelling underpinning the 2050 plan and is keeping details of the package – promised to secure Nationals support for the mid-century target – secret.00:02:28'It is not a revolution': Morrison announces plan for Australia to reach net zero by 2050 – videoThe plan – which Morrison promoted as “the Australian way” – is underpinned by an updated technology roadmap that prioritises investment in clean hydrogen, energy storage, low emissions steel and aluminium and carbon capture and storage. It also adds ultra-low cost solar as a new priority. The overall investment totals $20bn, the government said.The Coalition claims this will unlock between $60bn and $100bn of additional investment from the private sector and the states – an upgrade to the $50bn forecast last year – and create 62,000 new regional mining and heavy industry jobs.As a result, gross national income will be 1.6% higher, and Australians would be nearly $2,000 better off on average in 2050 compared to a scenario where no action was taken.Modelling underpinning the projections would be released “eventually”, Morrison said.How does Australia’s response to climate change compare with the rest of the world?Read moreThe prime minister also emphasised that the “technology not taxes” plan was based on existing government programs and would not require any new legislation, despite calls from Labor and independent MPs to enshrine the target in law.The focus of the plan was on bringing down the relative cost of low emissions technologies, which would result in an “accelerating deployment at scale across the economy”.Hydrogen, for example, has a production cost target of less than $2 a kilogram.“Our plan works with Australians to achieve this goal. Our plan enables them, it doesn’t legislate, it doesn’t mandate, it doesn’t force them. It respects them and understands that Australians want to do this … they want to protect their industries,” the prime minister said. The policy was based on “choices not mandates”, he said.Morrison conceded that at least 15% of the abatement task was based on “technology breakthroughs” in the future, saying this had been the experience of the modern world and no one could predict advances over the next 30 years.“The rate of technological advance is a given, it is actually a given in the modern world,” Morrison said. “To not think that is going to play a role over the next 30 years, that would be the more surprising assumption.”

It may well be technologies that we know quite a lot about, but have not yet gotten to the point where we can make priority technologies,” Taylor said.Morrison said the additional 15% earmarked as coming from future “breakthroughs” would come from the “evolution and the momentum” of earlier technology developments.“That is what has happened time immemorial. That is probably one of the safest assumptions you can make, that the rapid escalation of technology will continue to drive these costs down.”A breakdown of the emissions reduction forecasts shows that the electricity sector will reduce its emissions by 96% by 2050, signalling the withdrawal of coal from the sector. Taylor said gas would still play a role in Australia’s electricity generation mix.00:00:59Anthony Albanese criticises Coalition's 'scam' 2050 net zero Australian emissions target – videoThe transport sector would achieve a 79% cut in emissions supported by battery charging and hydrogen refuelling stations as “enabling” infrastructure. Emissions from mining, industry and manufacturing would drop 54%, while in agriculture, the forecast is for a 40% cut.Labor blasted the proposal as a “scam” that lacked substance and criticised the government for its decision not to release details of the deal struck with the Nationals.The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, said Morrison had outlined the “vibe” of a climate policy which had no new commitments.“We haven’t seen the modelling, and we haven’t had the detail. Because there is net zero modelling, net zero legislation and net zero unity,” Albanese said.“But in their own words, there is nothing new in this plan. The word plan doesn’t constitute a plan no matter how often he said and what form it’s printed. As always, with this prime minister, it is all about marketing. All about the spend, never about the substance.”Young Australians lodge human rights complaints with UN over alleged government inaction on climateRead moreThe shadow climate change minister, Chris Bowen, said the only new element of the climate policy was “a pay rise for Keith Pitt” – in reference to the extra cabinet position secured by the Nationals.“They’ve introduced an emissions trading promotions policy. That’s all we’ve got.”Morrison said the agreement with the Nationals had resulted in the inclusion of a five-yearly review of the net zero target that would be undertaken by the Productivity Commission and a pledge to invest in the regions and to cut red tape.He said any other spending commitments made as part of the deal would be unveiled in the lead-up to the next election.“All of our policies will be announced before the election, in particular, there will be a budget next year,” Morrison said. After abandoning efforts to update Australia’s 2030 emissions target from the 26% to 28% cut on 2005 levels, Morrison announced that the country was on track to achieve an actual reduction of between 30% and 35% on 2005 levels.This was attributed to the rapid take-up of rooftop solar, energy efficiency measures, and changes in land use.Quick GuideHow to get the latest news from Guardian AustraliaShow Email: sign up for our daily morning and afternoon email newslettersApp: download our free app and never miss the biggest storiesSocial: follow us on YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook or TwitterPodcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite appPhotograph: Tim Robberts/Stone RFWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.In question time on Tuesday, Morrison presented the government’s policy as one that was “based on choices, not mandates on the Australian people”.The deputy prime minister and Nationals leader, Barnaby Joyce, went further, saying Labor’s policy was only about legislation.“Legislation brings in laws, and laws outlaw things, and laws enforce penalties, so we do have a clear differentiation, we have a chasm between the two different policies because we believe in inspiration and technology and they believe in laws and penalties.”Albanese is yet to detail Labor’s climate policy after it abandoned a previous target of a 45% reduction by 2030 after the last election.Labor is expected to unveil its new “ambitious” policy after the Glasgow summit, with Bowen saying it would be announced in “the coming weeks”.",
 UN criticised over statement on overuse of antibiotics in farming,"Statement calling for significant cut in antimicrobial drug usage is ‘real missed opportunity’, say critics","['Supported by', 'About this content', 'Sophie Kevany']","Animal health experts and UN leaders have called for a significant reduction in antimicrobial drug usage in food animals, which is already causing a “silent pandemic”.But critics say the statement is “a real missed opportunity”, pointing to its failure to set reduction targets or even call for a ban on the use of antibiotics for animal growth promotion.Drugs which are critical for humans are being used in enormous quantities in animal production. As a result there is a far higher probability of drug-resistant bacteria and viruses emerging. This could lead to some of the world’s most important drugs becoming ineffective against common infectious diseases such as pneumonia, tuberculosis and gonorrhoea, with death rates rising.The joint statement issued this week by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the UN’s global leaders group on antimicrobial resistance called for “significant and urgent reduction in the amounts of antimicrobial drugs, including antibiotics, used in food systems” and said this was “critical to combating rising levels of drug resistance”.The overuse of antimicrobials has led to what G7 leaders called a “silent pandemic” in June. Drug-resistant diseases already cause at least 700,000 human deaths globally every year, according to the statement. “The world is rapidly heading towards a tipping point where the antimicrobials relied on to treat infections in humans, animals and plants will no longer be effective.”Antimicrobial drugs, which include antibiotics, antifungals and antiparasitics, are used in food production all over the world, the statement said, and are “administered to animals not only for veterinary purposes (to treat and prevent disease), but also to promote growth in healthy animals”.But despite the statement’s strong wording, experts said it had few teeth.“Basically what [this call] lacks is a clear target for reduction,” said Thomas Van Boeckel, an antimicrobial resistance, disease, and livestock production systems scientist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology.Although commendable, the statement does not say “quantitatively what they mean by significant”, Van Boeckel said. That meant, “they make no commitment, basically”, he added.He said the targets must be country specific. “It would be unfair, for example, to impose stringent targets on developing countries who need livestock for their livelihoods.”But, he said, high-income countries and China could aim for less than 50mg of active antibiotic ingredient per kilogram of meat raised. Many EU countries are using more than that, he said, referencing a 2017 paper he co-authored.Van Boeckel’s paper found that implementing a global cap of 50mg of antimicrobials, per kilogram of animal product, per year could reduce total consumption by 64%.The paper said the 50mg cap corresponded to the average global use of antimicrobials in 2017. It further recommended user fees and caps on veterinary use to control antimicrobials.“This statement is far too cautious and a real missed opportunity,” said Cóilín Nunan, a scientific adviser at the Alliance to Save our Antibiotics. “There is no target [and] not even a call for an immediate end to the use of antibiotics for [livestock] growth promotion.”Most disappointing, he said, is how little the statement says about intensive farming. “Intensive farming, the root cause of so much animal disease and antibiotic use, is once again let off the hook. Where is the global leadership that is needed if we are ever to move to more sustainable farming practices and drastically cut farm antibiotic use?”Henk Hobbelink, an agronomist and co-founder of the small-farmer focused NGO Grain, agreed and said the use of antimicrobial growth promoters in factory farming needed “to be banned, immediately and everywhere”.Another solution that has been suggested is to develop animal-only antibiotics. Timothy Walsh, who is working with a team to develop animal only replacements at the Ineos Oxford Institute (IOI) for antimicrobial research, said it was “bonkers to use the same drugs in animal feeds as you would to treat neonatal sepsis”.The IOI’s vision, he said, is to “move to a place where in supermarkets across the UK and beyond food will be labelled NHA [meaning] no human antibiotics” but it “will take, time, effort, money, goodwill and global policy”.Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

" This article is more than 5 months oldAir conditioning: the benefits, problems and alternativesThis article is more than 5 months old","Amid record-breaking heat, increased access to air conditioning could save lives – but AC units are damaging the environment. Are there other options?",['Dharna Noor'],"Much of the Earth sweltered under record-topping temperatures this month. Phoenix, Arizona, broke its record for most 110F (43.3C) days. California’s Death Valley had its highest temperature ever. An airport in coastal Iran saw a heat index of 152F, while Beijing saw a record stretch of 95F days.Oppressive heatwaves have become more frequent and more severe as a result of the climate crisis – a trend that’s expected to continue, and could worsen in proportion to how quickly we can transition from fossil fuels.To beat the heat, people are increasingly turning to air conditioning. The number of AC units globally could increase by 244% by 2050, according to the International Energy Agency, and demand could rise by 59% within the US, according to a 2020 analysis by independent research group Climate Central.Increased access to air conditioning could save lives; after all, in the US, extreme heat is the single deadliest form of extreme weather. But it could also come with drawbacks.Below we look at the challenges today and in the years ahead, and consider some of the alternatives.Billions of people don’t have access, and the energy costs are hugeThe technology can be expensive to purchase and run, often rendering it inaccessible to poor communities in the US and globally. In the US, research shows lower-income households are much more likely to lack access to the technologies. And one 2019 study found that between 1.8 and 4.1 billion people in developing countries who regularly experience dangerously high temperatures lack access to cooling technology.Stacked bar chart of homes AC-status by income level.“In much of the world, in many countries, we’re concerned that people who most need air conditioning don’t have it,” said said Narasimha Rao, a professor of energy systems at Yale University who co-authored the paper.AC usage also puts pressure on electricity grids. That can be risky: if a five-day heat wave and a power outage hit the city of Phoenix at the same time, more than 50% of the city’s current population of 1.4 million could end up in the emergency room, one recent study found.Many are working to make air conditioners more affordable and to improve the reliability of electricity grids. Yet there is another problem: air conditioners warm the Earth.The appliances use a lot of energy. Between now and 2050, cooling technologies including AC units are projected to be the biggest contributor to growing energy demand, according to the Intergovernmental Energy Agency – a problem, since most global energy currently comes from fossil fuels. The US broke its summer record for daily gas consumption on at least two separate occasions, data from S&P Global Commodity Insights shows, and AC usage is a key contributor.Most AC models also require the use of planet-heating chemicals to cool the air. The most commonly used refrigerants in ACs are hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are potent greenhouse gases – thousands of times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide.Some air conditioners do use the more climate-friendly refrigerants hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs), though these can still create ecological damage. Other alternatives include ammonia and propane, but both can be harmful to humans when they leak.Companies are now also using newer kinds of refrigerants, like R-32, which is an HFC that is half as planet-warming as older ones traditionally used for air conditioning.And experts say that by employing other strategies to lower temperatures in homes, we can lessen the environmental toll of air conditioning, allowing people to stay cool without warming the planet.There are more energy-saving cooling technologiesOne of the buzziest air conditioning technologies are electric heat pumps, which can both heat and cool homes. On hot days, the appliances pump hot air out of the home and draw cool air in.Traditional ACs and heat pumps both cool homes by directly lowering air temperature and also by pulling moisture out of the air, which can make a home more comfortable. But combining the two processes makes the appliances “terribly inefficient”, said Les Norford, professor of building technology in the Department of Architecture at MIT.Two charts. On top, an area chart of AC units added over time by countries, increasing from 1990 to 2050. Below, a bar chart showing the share of new electricity demands from 2018 to 2050 related to buildings.Norford and others are working to develop new technologies that separate the two functions to boost efficiency. Some models use living membranes or physical desiccants – materials that suck up humidity – instead of energy-powered processes to pull moisture from the air.Improving the energy efficiency of air conditioners is crucial. According to the International Energy Agency, in 2018, the average air was less than half as efficient as the best available technology. And the least efficient models – often found in low-income households – require even more power to run, rendering them both more climate-warming and expensive.More options for coolingOther common technologies can play a major role in cooling homes. Fans, for instance, are much cheaper and far less energy consuming than ACs, said Rao, the Yale professor. They can also be surprisingly effective, especially in hot, dry environments.“In some cases they can provide up to 2C of relief,” he said.Rao is also studying the potential for dehumidifiers to be used as a widespread cooling technology, as they can also greatly improve comfort in hot and muggy areas.“In Mumbai, where I’m from, you can have tremendous relief from drying the air,” he said. “In my house it’s pretty hot and humid, but I go to the basement which has no air conditioning, just dehumidification, and it’s still so much cooler.”In hot and dry heat, another useful low-energy technology is the air cooler, also known as the swamp cooler. These devices use a fan to recirculate air across a cool, wet material and then disperse the freshly dampened, cool air into the home. Like dehumidifiers and fans, swamp coolers are cost and energy efficient, and are also widely available.But there are low-tech ways to keep homes cool, tooBuildings can be better designed to keep temperatures down.One crucial strategy is weatherization, said Vivek Shandas, a geography professor at Portland State University who studies the impacts of climate change in urban areas.“We’re often throwing AC at homes – especially older homes, homes where lower-income communities of color live – without doing any weatherization like insulating or sealing up the cracks the windows and the doors where that outside extreme heat can come in,” he said. As a result, residents can end up being forced to crank the ACs to their highest settings to keep indoor temperatures down.Weatherization, said Shandas, would reduce the amount of AC required to maintain a comfortable setting, resulting in lower energy bills and greenhouse gas emissions.Some homes are also built with highly heat-absorbing materials. Residents of mobile homes and trailers, which are often made with steel or aluminum, are often most vulnerable to extreme heat, said Shandas.A window mounted air conditioning unit in Phoenix. Photograph: Patrick T Fallon/AFP/Getty ImagesIn south Asia and other parts of the global south, said Rao, metal roofs – often found on slums – are common because they are inexpensive.“An aluminum sheet for a roof is the worst thing you can do from a heat perspective,” he said.But some materials used to make homes, such as brick and stone, can absorb and release heat more slowly. Improving the availability and affordability of such materials could save lives in the extreme heat.Homes – especially roofs – can also be painted white to lower indoor temperatures. White roofs products stay coolest under the sun’s rays because they reflecting away between 60 and 90% of sunlight, according to the Department of Energy. And buildings can be designed with ventilation in mind to lower temperatures. Wind towers, for instance, can be built to draw cool breeze indoors; placing ponds of water underneath them can make the structures even more effective.What about shade?Shade can make a big difference within the home and outside of it. The simple act of drawing opaque curtains closed, for instance, can help push down indoor temperatures, said Shandas. Communities can employ that same strategy by planting trees throughout neighborhoods.“We know that treed neighborhoods can be up to 15 degrees cooler than ones with no trees,” said Shandas.Trees and other plant life can also be installed on rooftops to help insulate buildings from hot air outside. These strategies are especially useful in urban “heat islands” where abundant concrete draws in thermal energy – areas which are disproportionately occupied by low-income people of color, Shandas added.Can we get rid of AC?Experts say a world eliminating AC would be dangerous.“There are some parts of the world where really, you cannot do without air conditioning, where you have really muggy weather throughout the year,” said Rao.But strategically using other methods to cool down communities could cut costs and emissions. It could also cut down on a knock-on effect of air conditioning: in highly dense areas, running them can raise outdoor temperatures by 1C (1.8F).Different strategies will work best in different contexts, said Shandas. And in some cases, several should be applied at once.“We are not in a position as a species to necessarily think that we are going to be able to find that silver bullet out of this extreme heat,” said Shandas. “We need to be finding the myriad different effective solutions that are socially and politically palatable, and that are sustainable in the long run.”",2023-08-02
Pollutionwatch: the sad end of the Met Office’s atmospheric survey plane,Moasa aircraft will no longer measure pollutants over UK after funding ended,"['Gary Fuller', '@drgaryfuller']","The Met Office’s atmospheric survey aircraft (Moasa) flew for the last time on 11 April, after funding ended.Packed with scientific instruments, Moasa has been on standby to examine the fringes of volcanic ash clouds to see if it is safe for commercial jets. It also flew over London, Birmingham and Manchester to see pollution changes during lockdown and recently worked with university researchers as they made measurements on the ground.It was designed to carry three people, and on first impression flying in Moasa felt like a fairground ride. The pilot Tim Lewton seemed worryingly busy with controls as we climbed away from Bournemouth airport, the propellers thundering a few metres from my head. The Met Office scientist Joss Kent sat behind me watching readouts from instruments hung below the wings and packed into the cabin and nose. A laser probed the air above us too. Kent read out results from our first source of the day, the nitrogen dioxide from the aircraft around us. Others followed.Aircraft measurements began in 1918 and have been important to predict how pollutants build up in the air over our cities and how polluted air moves from place to place. In the 1970s they were pivotal to connecting the UK’s coal-fired power stations to acid rain and forest dieback in Scandinavia.Moasa was designed after the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption that closed most of Europe’s airspace.Over the countryside we saw dust from construction sites and quarries, and measured soot from bonfires on farms.As we passed low over Canary Wharf and the Millennium Dome in London, Moasa’s instruments detected the nitrogen dioxide and particle pollution drifting upward from the city’s traffic.Over the Channel smoke trails hung behind the ships below. Marine fuel used in the Channel contains 100 times more sulphur than the petrol and diesel in a car, as well as many heavy metals. From the Channel we also saw a brown layer of air pollution from agriculture and industry settled over France. This would spread over London later that day.Our home leg took us at low level, 150 metres (500ft) above the sea. Previous flights have measured pollution from the cruise ships moored in Southampton Water, but I suggested diverting over the domed-shaped Marchwood waste incinerator. As we turned, we measured one of the biggest pollution spikes of the day; but it was also one of our closest sources at just a couple of hundred metres beneath. A quick check of the instruments showed the incinerator’s particle filters were working.The data we collected will be used to drive warning systems to tell vulnerable people when air pollution is going to become especially severe and to verify that pollution sources are being controlled correctly. Sadly, with funding at an end, it looks like Moasa will be sold and converted back into a small passenger plane.",2022-05-06
 Doctors issue official guidance on effects of air pollution and bushfire smoke on pregnant people ,"Information should serve as ‘wake-up call’ that action on climate change is needed to protect people and their children

The pamphlet – which acknowledges that studies in Australia suggest low-level day-to-day exposure to air pollution may influence foetal growth – also outlines a number of actions that can be taken to mitigate risk, including use of high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) cleaners and apps that monitor air quality, as well as wearing masks and recommends avoidance strategies such as not walking down busy roads at rush hour.Barnden said RANZCOG first became aware of the lack of information available in 2020.“There was a lot of concern amongst pregnant women, and a lot of talk on social media about potential risk of smoke for pregnancy, but we found there was really no resource to which we could direct women and caregivers for more information,” she said.“We also wanted to be able to reassure women that if they are healthy and if they do take whatever steps they can to minimise the exposure to pollution, that the effects on pregnancy will actually be relatively small.”Quick GuideHow to get the latest news from Guardian AustraliaShow Email: sign up for our daily morning and afternoon email newslettersApp: download our free app and never miss the biggest storiesSocial: follow us on YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook or TwitterPodcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite appPhotograph: Tim Robberts/Stone RFWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Barnden hopes the pamphlet will raise awareness about the various sources of air pollution, because “there is certainly a lot more than just bushfires that can affect pregnancy”, and how this exposure can be minimised.The issuing of the pamphlet follows reporting by Guardian Australia in January and March of this year, detailing how Australian public health messaging was not fully informing or explaining the risks of exposure to pregnant patients or those planning to conceive, nor did it outline concrete mitigation or minimisation strategies.“Articles published in the Guardian did an excellent job of pulling together the available research on air pollution and pregnancy and communicating it to the public, when there was really very little else around,” said Barnden.“The concern voiced by women and health professionals in response to these articles made it clear to us that a resource for women and health professionals was necessary.”",2021-01-06
 Coral crusaders: Costa Rica’s young divers learn to protect their seas,"In Puerto Viejo, scuba diving was once just for tourists, but a centre is training young people with few opportunities to care for the ocean on their doorstep","['The age of extinction is supported by', 'About this content', 'Monica Pelliccia']","“I put fresh almond leaves in your underwater masks as anti-fogging – a way to avoid using chemicals. You can remove them once in the water, just before diving,” says Salim Vasquez, 14, pushing her dreadlocks away from her mask.She distributes the equipment to her fellow divers, who are aged between 14 and 24, and Ana María Arenas, a group coordinator. It is 8am on a cloudy Sunday morning in Puerto Viejo, a Jamaican-inspired city in the south of Costa Rica. The young conservationists are preparing to dive into the Caribbean water for their weekly reef monitoring.Adir Garrido, Maitén Moore, Anumí Sassaroli, Esteban Gallo and Salim, as well as almost two dozen local divers, are part of the Ambassadors of the Sea Community Diving Centre, a non-profit organisation created in 2014 to provide opportunities for young people to do conservation work, such as seabed cleaning, reef monitoring, water pollution analysis, and underwater archaeology.Here, scuba diving has always been too expensive for locals. Not any more for the youth, who dive with a purposeMaría Suárez Toro“I was one of the four founders with my brothers and my neighbour,” remembers Esteban, 24. Now he is setting up his own business: a mechanical workshop to fix diving equipment. “It’s not easy to be young in Puerto Viejo. We don’t have opportunities, most of my classmates are involved in drug dealing and petty crime. The centre took us out of this context and opened doors in sea protection.”The idea for the centre came from María Suárez Toro, a Puerto Rican journalist and fisher who arrived in Costa Rica 50 years ago. Her love of the sea started in childhood when she learned to fish, swim and walk almost at the same age. “Here, scuba diving has always been an activity for tourists, too expensive for locals. Not any more for the youth of the centre, who dive with a purpose,” says Suárez.Royer Colomer, president of the dive centre (left), with young divers Esteban Gallo and Anumí Sassaroli. Photograph: Courtesy of Ambassadors of the Sea Community Diving CentreSupported by the United Nations Office for Project Services (Unops), the centre has so far offered 200 free training courses in open water and rescue diving, underwater archaeology, and coral monitoring to young people. There are some requirements to participate: getting good grades at school, learning to cook a Caribbean meal as a part of cultural preservation, carrying out beach cleaning, becoming a sea ambassador and fully participating in the centre’s activities.“As sea ambassadors, we bring to the earth what’s hidden under the water,” says Anumí, 18. She has just finished high school and has enrolled for an oceanographic university degree. In the future, she hopes to run a project to protect sharks, her favourite animal. “When I was little, I expressed my frustrations to my grandfather. I complained about the selfishness of people who didn’t want to give up their habits that are detrimental to the planet. Then I got involved in the centre, and it became a family to me.”As Afro-descendants, taking care of the sea means also discovering the past hidden in the abyss and giving voice to our rootsMaitén Moore, 14During the pandemic, with schools closed and online lessons not accessible to all, the centre became increasingly important for the young divers. “During the lockdown, when all the activities stopped, we saw more corals and animals than ever: also the seahorses were back,” says Ana María. Through constant coral monitoring, they were able to correct the local misconception that the reef was dead due to pollution.“Saying that the reef was dead was an excuse for not taking care of the ocean,” she says. “Also, companies took advantage of it and proposed projects of oil exploitation or dock constructions that we stopped over the years. Our constant monitoring showed that the reef was alive.”“The pandemic teaches us that the reef is not so fragile, it only needs better waters,” says Isaac Baldizón, a marine biologist, who works with the centre.Some of the young divers pose for a group photo on Puerto Viejo beach.

After a quick 20-metre swim, the reef is under their flippers. Anumí and Ana María analyse the health and whitening of the corals, and Maitén and Salim count the fish, such as the reef cleaner, parrotfish, and the blue-spotted damselfish.Maitén, 14, and her fellow divers are also studying two wrecks, thought to be linked to the slave trade, that sank many years ago in nearby Cahuita bay.All coral reefs in western Indian Ocean ‘at high risk of collapse in next 50 years’Read more“As Afro-descendants, taking care of the sea means also discovering the past hidden in the abyss and giving voice to our roots,” says Maitén, who is interested in submarine archaeology.“The vessels have always been there. Old people considered them as pirate legends,” says Maitén. “In August, Ghana’s Ashanti king came to Puerto Viejo. He did an emotional ritual above the wrecks to honour the memory of enslaved Africans who were shipwrecked off the Caribbean coast more than 300 years ago. I was moved to tears.”The study of the wrecks, thought by some to be the remains of two Danish ships carrying enslaved people in the early 18th century, will continue next spring. In the meantime, the divers dream of having a new headquarters, Casa del Mar [Sea House], to welcome visitors and children from the community.

" UK failing to protect against climate dangers, advisers warn","It is ‘absolutely illogical’ not to tackle the risks of heatwaves and power blackouts, says Climate Change Committee","['Damian Carrington', ' Environment editor', '@dpcarrington']","The UK government is failing to protect people from the fast-rising risks of the climate crisis, from deadly heatwaves to power blackouts, its official climate advisers have warned.The climate change committee said action to improve the nation’s resilience is not keeping pace with the impacts of global heating, many of which are already causing harm. The CCC’s experts said they were frustrated by the “absolutely illogical” lack of sufficient action on adaptation, particularly as acting is up to 10 times more cost-effective than not doing so.They said climate change was here now. In 2020’s heatwave, 2,500 people died in the UK, but the CCC said the government had not heeded their warnings for more than a decade that homes must be made easier to cool, such as by using shutters.Cutting carbon emissions remained vital to avoid the worst climate impacts, the CCC said, but some were inevitable. It highlighted a series of risks that required action within two years at the latest. These included damage to woodlands and peatlands by high temperatures and drought that would prevent the UK meeting its goal of net zero emissions by 2050, because these areas would be unable to remove CO2 from the atmosphere.“Adaptation remains the Cinderella of climate change, still sitting in rags by the stove: under-resourced, underfunded and often ignored,” said Baroness Brown, the chair of the CCC’s adaptation committee. “Not only is it essential that we do adaptation, but it also provides economic benefit. So it’s absolutely illogical that we are not doing it.”“Our particular frustration is that after the last climate-change risk assessment in 2016, the adaptation plan that was published was really inadequate,” she said. “It didn’t address many of the risks highlighted and it wasn’t in any way action focused. A detailed, effective action plan that prepares the UK for climate change is now essential and needed urgently.”Chris Stark, the CCC’s chief executive, said there was a “wilful reluctance” of ministers to factor adaptation into their policies: “That’s because it’s hard, it doesn’t fit with the [five-year] political cycle and it doesn’t have the glamour of net zero attached to it. The government has got to get real about it.”The CCC’s report is based on an independent 1,500-page analysis by 450 experts from 130 organisations that provides a comprehensive view of the climate-change risks faced by the UK. “Alarmingly, this new evidence shows the gap between the level of risk we face and the level of adaptation under way has widened,” it said. “The UK has the capacity and the resources to respond effectively, yet it has not done so.”The assessment considered 53 risks linked to future temperature rises of between 2C and 4C of global heating and found there was sufficient adaptation under way for only four. Even if heating was limited to 2C, an optimistic scenario, the number of risks with annual costs in the billions per year would triple by the 2080s, the CCC said.Climate crisis to put millions of British homes at risk of subsidingRead moreThe report highlights the impact of heatwaves on human health and productivity, particularly in homes, hospitals and care homes that are unable to remain cool. Since the 2016 assessment, more than 570,000 new homes have been built that are not resilient to high temperatures and a further 1.5m such homes are due to be built in the next five years unless building policy is changed to improve ventilation and shading. More heat is also increasing costly home subsidence in some regions, with 10,000 homes affected after the 2018 heatwave.The vulnerability of the power grid to flooding, storms and lack of cooling water is also highlighted, with the impact of future blackouts likely to be even more severe with cars and home heating becoming increasingly electrified. Another risk is that extreme weather overseas could break supply chains for food imported by the UK.Nature and wildlife are also at risk from the climate crisis, with knock-on effects for people if ecosystems cannot absorb carbon and soak up water to reduce flood risk. The CCC said the UK will require 80m tonnes of CO2 a year to be removed from the air by 2050 to compensate for sectors unable to completely decarbonise, such as aviation.“We cannot expect nature to mop up all that carbon if it’s too hot and too dry for the trees to grow,” said Stark. Restoring nature now so it can survive future climate impacts is vital, the CCC said.Peatlands can store huge amounts of carbon but Kathryn Brown, at the CCC, said they were “liable to collapse” with heat and drought if in poor condition. Today only about 5% of upland peat is in good condition and the UK’s recent commitments will restore only another 5%, she said. “We need to see 100% restoration by 2045.”The Met Office’s Prof Richard Betts, a lead author of the technical report, said he had been struck by the projected increases in landslides during heavier rainstorms, in places such as railway embankments and coal waste tips in Wales.Sales of peat compost to gardeners to be banned from 2024Read moreThe CCC report said there would be potential climate benefits in a hotter UK, such as longer growing seasons and reduced number of deaths due to winter cold and lower home heating bills. But these were far outweighed by the negative impacts, it said.The CCC’s last risk assessment in 2016 warned the UK was poorly prepared for water shortages and floods, and while further adaptation action was needed, some had been taken. In 2019, the CCC repeated its warnings that the UK had no proper plans for protecting people from heatwaves, flash flooding and other impacts of the climate crisis.A government spokesperson said: “We welcome this report and will consider its recommendations closely as we continue to demonstrate global leadership on climate change ahead of COP26 in November.” The government is consulting on regulations to reduce the risk of overheating in new residential buildings.",2019-11-20

Darwin’s ‘sustainable’ Middle Arm development is key to huge fossil fuel projects, documents show
","['Paul Karp', ' Chief political correspondent', '@Paul_Karp']","Peter Dutton has claimed that Labor “wants gas gone” in a speech signalling the Coalition will oppose changes to resource tax and environmental laws, seeking to tie them to inflation in energy prices.Despite the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association backing the Albanese government’s proposed changes to the petroleum resource rent tax, the opposition leader will use its conference to urge the gas industry to “fight for your sector” alongside the Coalition.Speaking remotely to the conference in Adelaide, Dutton invoked Ronald Reagan’s policies responding to the oil crisis in 1981 by letting “freedom solve the problem through the magic of the marketplace”.Darwin’s ‘sustainable’ Middle Arm development is key to huge fossil fuel projects, documents showRead moreDutton railed against a series of Labor policies: reduced funding for gas exploration and infrastructure, including exclusion from the national reconstruction fund; a mandatory code of conduct, which ensures supply of gas at reasonable prices; the safeguard mechanism, which requires new gas projects for export to have net zero emissions; and the temporary coal and gas price cap.The price cap has been praised by industrial gas users and the competition regulator, and was estimated by Treasury to save households $230 on their power bills compared with larger projected rises.Dutton argued that although the cap “was meant to shield Australian families, businesses and manufacturers from price spikes … power prices continue to go up”.

Labor came to office in May 2022 as Australians were being slugged with price rises driven, in part, by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The announcement of price rises of up to 20% was delayed by the Coalition in their last month in office.Dutton claimed that the safeguard mechanism amounts to “a new carbon tax law” that would be “financially crippling” for the industry.“There will be no choice but to pass that cost on to consumers, which impacts in a negative way on inflation.”By contrast, “the Coalition trusts industries instinctively to set their own pathway to net zero emissions by 2050”, he said.“The markets require that. The media requires it. Your investors require it.”Dutton said the sector was liable to pay a 40% tax rate on offshore oil and gas projects, but “because the Labor government can’t manage money, it wants to hit you with the hammer of taxation”.On Wednesday, after a similar attack by shadow treasurer Angus Taylor on the PRRT changes designed to net just $2.4bn over four years, Appea’s chief executive, Samantha McCulloch, said the changes “provide greater certainty” to the industry about “the future investment required to maintain both domestic and regional gas supply security for our customers”.“Australia needs a strong and sustainable future for the gas industry and that requires stable and enduring policy settings, and for that we consider bipartisan support is important,” she told Guardian Australia.Dutton claimed that “the worst is yet to come”, citing proposed changes to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act and the planned Environment Protection Agency.“Yes of course, we all want to protect and improve our environment. But we also have an obligation to promote the longevity of Australian industries and businesses which underpin our economic prosperity.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So should MPs and the media | Adam MortonRead moreDutton claimed that Labor was driven by “renewable zealotry” and despite repeated support from Anthony Albanese and the energy minister, Chris Bowen, for the gas industry “their actions betray their words”.“I want to say to you today that a returned Coalition government will work once again with your sector to put more supply into the domestic system.“To make sure that we have more gas available for export so that we can continue to grow the sector. Just like Reagan, we will wind back government intervention.”Dutton urged the gas sector “to fight for yourselves” and “speak up frankly and more avidly”. “We need you to work with us to push back against this government’s detrimental policies.”Santos CEO Kevin Gallagher during the APPEA conference on Thursday. Photograph: Matt Turner/AAPThe opposition leader was followed by Santos chief executive Kevin Gallagher, who acknowledged Dutton’s address before focusing on an earlier speech by SA energy minister Tom Koutsantonis, who told the industry that the state government was “at your disposal”. Gallaghar described this as a “breath of fresh air”.“It’s not very often in our industry that we are so warmly welcomed and appreciated for the contribution that we make to Australia’s world-class living standards. And for the leading role we play in the energy transition to net zero,” Gallagher said.Bill Hare warns of loss of ‘biggest opportunity’Bill Hare, a physicist and climate scientist, warned that Dutton’s position risked setting Australia back, as “our companies will lose market share” while the rest of the world decarbonises.“If Peter Dutton is serious about the longevity and sustainability of Australia, he would be calling for a more rapid rollout of renewables and green hydrogen for the sector’s steel, fertiliser, cement industries that are hard to abate,” Hare said.“This is literally the biggest opportunity Australia has had in a very long time and the risk is if we don’t take it now we will lose it.”On Saturday, Bowen told reporters that although the budget projects power prices to rise by 10% before Labor’s market interventions price rises were projected to be up to 40 or 50%.South Australia tells gas industry the state is ‘at your disposal’ Read moreBowen said that rebates of up to $500 for households and the price cap were temporary “to deal with a specific circumstance caused by the spike in energy prices around the world, caused by the illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine”.“Of course, ultimately, we continue on the transformation of our energy grid because the most, the cheapest form of energy is renewable energy and under this government that is the energy which will get support.”",2023-05-18
AnalysisRecord of climate denialism indicates how Rees-Mogg will handle energy briefFiona Harvey Environment correspondent,Green businesses and investors say prospect of green energy sceptic as cabinet minister in charge does not inspire confidence,,"Squeezing “every last cubic inch of gas” from the North Sea, re-starting fracking, rejecting windfarms in favour of fossil fuels – the policies espoused by Jacob Rees-Mogg, against a backdrop of rising energy prices, form a clear indication of how the new business secretary will view his brief.Rees-Mogg will be the core cabinet member as secretary of state for business and energy, with responsibility for meeting the UK’s legally binding target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. It is a goal he has previously described as “a long way off” and “a huge regulatory cost”.Late on Tuesday night No 10 announced that Graham Stuart would become minister for climate change and be attending cabinet, prompting speculation that Downing Street had succumbed to concerns of green Tories about giving the role to Rees-Mogg as originally planned.Jacob Rees-Mogg, who decried ‘climate alarmism’, to take on UK energy briefRead moreTom Burke, co-founder of the green thintank E3G and a veteran adviser to governments, summed up the views of many: “He has showed no sign of understanding the complexity or opportunity of net zero. There is nothing in his whole track record that shows any understanding of this issue. The single most important thing to do in energy policy now is to bring demand down. I have no confidence that he will take this forward.”An investor in oil and coal mining through Somerset Capital Management, the fund management firm he co-founded and still benefits from financially, Rees-Mogg has many times voiced climate denialism – even to the extent of misrepresenting climate science. In 2014, he told Chat Politics that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had found efforts to stop climate change would only work in the very long term.He claimed: “If you read the IPCC report on [the climate emergency] it said that if you were to take action now to try and stop man-made global warming, it would have no effect for hundreds or possibly a thousand years. I’m all in favour of long-term policymaking but I think that trying to forecast the climate for a thousand years, and what little steps you make now having the ability to change it, is unrealistic. And I think the cost of it is probably unaffordable.”In fact, the IPCC found that efforts to stop burning fossil fuels now were essential, and failure to do so would have an impact lasting thousands of years.Rees-Mogg, an Old Etonian, has been an MP for 12 years and has been a prominent Brexiter, leader of the House of Commons and most recently minister for Brexit opportunities. Though he has voted broadly with the Conservative government on issues outside Brexit, his voting record shows little inclination to champion green policies such as net zero, and a zeal for post-Brexit deregulation that campaigners fear will be carried over.Rebecca Newsom, head of politics at Greenpeace UK, said: “Rees-Mogg is the last person who should be in charge of the energy brief, at the worst possible moment. He blamed ‘climate alarmism’ for high energy bills, pushing David Cameron to ‘cut the green crap’ like incentives for solar, wind and energy efficiency, which has added £150 to every energy bill. Appointing him to the brief now suggests the Tories have learned nothing from years of energy policy incompetence.”He takes the brief at a time of unprecedented crisis for the UK’s energy industry, and for bill-payers, both domestic and in business. Millions of people are likely to struggle to pay their heating bills this winter, and even the price cap proposed by the prime minister, Liz Truss, will leave many households choosing between heating and eating. Small businesses are facing ruin without government help. The UK is also badly off-track to meet its net zero commitments, despite strong evidence that action to meet them would also bring down bills.The UK stands in need of vital energy investment, in renewables and low-carbon infrastructure. Green businesses and investors may find having a green energy sceptic as the cabinet minister in charge does not inspire confidence.Dave Timms, head of political affairs at Friends of the Earth, said: “Extracting more fossil fuels is a false solution to the energy crisis. It’s our failure to end our reliance on gas and oil that’s sent energy bills soaring and left us teetering on the brink of catastrophic climate change. We need a forward-looking, modern energy strategy based on better home insulation and unleashing the full potential of the UK’s homegrown renewables power – not one rooted in dirty fossil fuels of the past.”Rees-Mogg’s most recent predecessor offers a different example. Kwasi Kwarteng, now chancellor of the exchequer under Truss, took office under Boris Johnson as a confirmed de-regulator, one of the authors of the Britannia Unchained pamphlet that advocated a radical free market. But close associates say he changed his mind while in office, earlier this year taking a strong stance in favour of renewables as a solution to the Ukraine-related rise in energy prices.“I heard Kwarteng say that all his instincts were free market, but the more he understood of energy policy, the more he understood the need for intervention,” said Shaun Spiers, executive director of the Green Alliance thinktank. “Hopefully Rees-Mogg could go the same way. But nothing about him shows any particular willingness to listen, or to change his mind.”",
" Only one bathing river spot around Oxford has bacteria within safe levels, study finds",Other seven locations popular with locals have high concentrations of harmful bacteria due to sewage and livestock,['Sandra Laville'],"Only one popular river spot for bathing and water sports in and around Oxford has bacteria within safe levels, a survey by a campaign group has found.The other seven locations in rivers which are regularly used by swimmers, punters, rowers and kayakers, were found to have concentrations of harmful bacteria one and a half to three times above recommended safe levels, a study by the Oxford Rivers Project funded by Thames Water has found.The study concluded that at most of these locations the pollution was from sewage, although some locations were also affected by livestock.Claire Robertson, Thames21’s Oxford rivers project officer, said: “These results confirm what we expected to find: that levels of bacteria at our river recreation sites are higher than they should be. However, we don’t want people to be discouraged from swimming, punting, rowing and kayaking on Oxford’s rivers. They have a myriad of benefits, for personal health and wellbeing, and for the city as a whole.“We are glad that Thames Water funded and supported this research. Now, it’s time for them and the various authorities to put together an action plan and find the funding to cut down sewage and agricultural pollution to safe levels, and soon.”A section of the River Thames in the city, Wolvercote Mill Stream at Port Meadow, became only the second stretch of river in England to be given bathing water status last month.The status means the waters will be measured for two types of potentially harmful bacteria between 15 May and 30 September each year.But the Oxford Rivers Project has been working to highlight the quality of all the rivers in and around the city. Their study replicated tests which take place in bathing water designated areas such as Wolvercote Mill Stream.Volunteer citizen scientists took water samples at least once a month from 18 sites across Oxfordshire and analysed them for levels of E.coli and intestinal enterococci, bacteria harmful to human health.The bacteria levels were measured at a Thames Water laboratory, and the project was jointly funded by Oxford city council, the Rivers Trust and Thames Water.One site on a small brook downstream of Church Hanborough sewage treatment works was consistently 50 times the level safe for bathing, even when the treatment works was not overflowing and apparently treating the sewage, the study found.Ten sites on smaller upstream tributaries were also sampled. None met the level considered sufficient for bathing, ranging from close to the safe level within the Upper Thames and Windrush catchments, to seven times the safe level at Limb Brook and Evenlode catchments.How to turn England’s rivers from filthy sewers into shining streams | Rachel SalvidgeRead moreRichard Aylard, sustainability director at Thames Water, said: “Taking action to improve the health of rivers is a key focus for us. We are delighted that Wolvercote Mill Stream is now designated for swimming.Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST“Our own commitments to improve river health include reducing the annual duration of sewage discharges into rivers by 50% across the Thames Valley by 2030.” Aylard said the company had planned substantial investment in its water treatment sites to reduce spills of raw sewage, including a major expansion at Witney treatment works in Oxfordshire.He said the company was on track to provide live alerts to discharges from all 468 permitted locations across the region, within an hour of discharges starting and stopping, by the end of 2022.“We’re clear it’s completely unacceptable for any untreated sewage to enter rivers, whether it’s permitted or not,” he said. “Stopping discharges altogether will take time and sustained investment, however each step we take on this journey is a move in the right direction.”",2022-05-26
 Montreal to host delayed Cop15 summit to halt ‘alarming’ global biodiversity loss,"Experts warn ambitious targets for nature must be agreed at UN meeting, moved from China to Canada after two-year wait","['The age of extinction is supported by', 'About this content', 'Patrick Greenfield', '@pgreenfielduk']","The date for a key UN nature summit has finally been confirmed after more than two years of delays and amid fears momentum to halt biodiversity loss across the globe has been lost.Ahead of the latest round of negotiations in Nairobi this week, the UN convention on biological diversity confirmed that the Cop15 biodiversity conference will now take place in Montreal, Canada, from 5 to 17 December, after it became clear China would not be able to host the event in Kunming due to the country’s zero-Covid policy.It comes after several pandemic-related delays to the meeting, which was meant to take place in October 2020, and amid intense frustration with Beijing, who are holding the presidency for a major UN environmental agreement for the first time.Fears had been building over the prohibitive cost for smaller countries to participate in Cop15 if it were held in China, along with concerns over restrictions on civil society, Indigenous groups and the press.Q&AWhat is the Cop 15 biodiversity conference?ShowAt Cop15 – the 15th conference of the parties to the UN convention on biological diversity – governments will negotiate new targets to protect biodiversity for this decade. The accord, “a Paris agreement for nature”, aims to slow rampant biodiversity loss around the world and is part of the UN’s overarching plan that humanity should be living in harmony with nature by 2050. The summit was originally due to take place in Kunming, China, in October 2020 but after several delays the first face-to-face meeting is scheduled for December 2022 in Montreal, Canada.Why is it a big deal?Time is running out to take action. An international group of scientists, including Prof Paul Ehrlich, author of The Population Bomb, warned in January 2021 that the planet is facing a “ghastly future of mass extinction, declining health and climate-disruption upheavals” that threaten human survival. The world has failed to meet a single target agreed a decade ago to stem the destruction of wildlife and life-sustaining ecosystems.Are only governments worried?No. At the 2021 World Economic Forum, business leaders said biodiversity loss was the third biggest existential, or long-term, threat to the world and was among the top five risks in terms of impact, alongside infectious diseases, climate action failure, weapons of mass destruction and natural resource crises.What might the Kunming agreement look like?In January 2021, the UN convention on biological diversity published a 21-point draft of the agreement. It commits signatories to protect at least 30% of the planet, control invasive species and reduce pollution from plastic waste and excess nutrients by 50%. Governments are yet to negotiate properly on the draft targets. Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.At a meeting on Tuesday, officials signed off the plan to host Cop15 near the UN biodiversity headquarters in Quebec. China will maintain responsibility for hosting and organising the event, and will do so in coordination with the Canadian government.Steven Guilbeault, Canada’s environment minister, said the country was proud to host the conference. “There is an urgent need for international partners to halt and reverse the alarming loss of biodiversity worldwide,” he said.The once-a-decade nature summit will come after Cop27 in Egypt but clash with the World Cup in Qatar, prompting fears of a lack of attention and attendance by senior politicians and ministers, which was a key part of Cop26 in Glasgow, Scotland. The final global biodiversity framework agreement is likely to be negotiated in the hours before the World Cup final on 18 December.What really happened at Geneva’s crucial biodiversity negotiations? Read moreAt a parliamentary committee on Monday, UK environment ministers Lord Goldsmith and George Eustice refused to confirm whether the prime minister would attend but said he was likely to play a part.In a statement, China’s environment minister Huang Runqiu said the country would like to emphasise its continued strong commitment to working with all parties and stakeholders to ensure the success of Cop15.A two-week meeting  was hosted from Kunming in October ahead of the key summit but most delegates attended virtually.  Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockNegotiations for the agreement are scheduled to restart this week in Nairobi, Kenya, with significant divisions over proposals to protect 30% of land and sea, money for protecting biodiversity and the use of the digital sequence information to produce cosmetics, drugs and other products.Governments have never met a target to halt the destruction of nature and there are fears that this agreement will be a repeat of what has gone before, amid concerns of a standoff with the global north and south over resources to protect natural places.In March, the end of talks in Geneva saw a dramatic intervention by Gabon on behalf of a group of developing countries calling for $100bn (£80bn) of biodiversity finance on top of the $100bn of climate financing that has been causing divisions ahead of Cop27.Despite the clarity over the Cop15 date, Oscar Soria, campaign director of the activism site Avaaz, said that the talks had lost momentum and it was a lost opportunity to show leadership on the environment.“2020 was supposed to be the super year for nature led by China; two years later Beijing’s indecision seriously jeopardised a diplomatic process to halt biodiversity loss.“Now, this super year of failure can only be averted by the leadership of the UN. We have just a few months, and lots of diplomatic work needs to be done. And while there’s now clarity on when and where the next Cop will happen, a big question remains on China’s ability to effectively hold the presidency towards an ambitious deal for nature,” he said.Li Shuo, a policy adviser for Greenpeace China, said: “Governments have finally made a decision on where and when the Cop15 will be held. This should now focus everyone’s minds on the quality of the deal. That means ambitious targets to ensure strong protection both on land and at sea and a robust implementation package.“The upcoming preparatory session in Nairobi should see countries advancing the draft deal. The remaining months to Cop15 should be used effectively to unlock contentious issues such as finance.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",2022-12-04
"Country diary: These woods, this hill, are now out of reach","Sandy, Bedfordshire: The town fireworks were held in Cox’s Hill every year, but no longer",['Derek Niemann'],"On the country side of the rail tracks, Victorian picks and shovels once turned a hill into a hollow. After the quarrying ended, the landscape of Cox’s Hill was left contoured like a sports stadium – a flattish, sparsely grassed central pitch surrounded by stepped terracing on three sides, the west bank having been sliced away by the railway cutting. Crowds came to stand there over the ensuing decades – crowds of birches, sycamores, and bramble thickets.The town fireworks were held in this wood-fringed bowl every year before the pandemic. In lockdown, townspeople crossed the bridge to breathe in its green lungs and children played.Not any more. Shortly before Christmas, the landowning estate barred unofficial access by erecting a post and wire fence along the entire length fronting the lane, reinforcing the exclusion with “keep out” posts at regular intervals. I had walked the woods most weeks through the Covid pandemic, chatting with dogs and their owners. Lately, I patrolled the road outside, looking in at familiar features that were now out of reach.Fenced-off land at Cox’s Hill. The wires on the fence have lost their tautness because they’ve been cut further along. Photograph: Sarah NiemannI see a mature tree, one of many that I have found with shattered glass underneath. I can see – just – through to the “pitch” where last year caravans rocked up and, over the course of a few days, their owners emptied both the vans and themselves before moving on. And there, a still-bare patch among the brambles – one of four I sniffed out when fires were lit during our flammable July. The flames licked towards the edge of a mini-cliff, a popular spot from which to hurl tin cans, bottles, off-white goods, a saggy armchair, a sofa. Such behaviour is unacceptable in a national park, local park or any natural area.There is, of course, too much British land that is off limits to the public. But in this instance, it’s no wonder the estate erected a barrier as a solution to, as the signs put it, “multiple incidents of antisocial behaviour”. Today, only words are stopping me from going inside. A week or so ago, the wires were cut and fenceposts heaved out of the ground. Cox’s Hill is off limits to the law-abiding, while miscreants are still making mischief. Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary",2023-02-17
‘I was terrified’: the vet sterilizing Pablo Escobar’s ‘cocaine hippos’,The progeny of animals brought illegally to Colombia and kept in the drug lord’s private zoo must now be put on birth control,"['Joe Parkin Daniels', ' in Bogotá', '@joeparkdan']","When Gina Paola Serna studied to become a biologist and veterinarian in Colombia, she never expected to one day be tasked with neutering an invasive herd of hippos that once belonged to Pablo Escobar.When they were smuggled into the drug lord’s private zoo in the 1980s, there were just four hippos. But in the 26 years since Escobar’s death, their numbers have steadily grown : the herd now includes about 80 animals – threatening to disrupt ecosystems in Colombia. So now, Serna spends her days tracking and sterilizing the hulking riverine mammals.“The first time I worked with a hippo I was terrified – these are animals way bigger than we are used to working with in Colombia,” Serna said, before another day in the field. “These are massive and territorial animals, so everything is complicated when it comes to working with them.”The so called “cocaine hippos” were illegally brought to Colombia and kept in a zoo Escobar built on his vast Hacienda Nápoles estate, along the River Magdalena. He brought rhinos, giraffes and zebras to his menagerie. Oral history suggests his associates were wowed by his collection of spectacular beasts of the wild, which included about 200 animals.A pink statue of a hippo greets tourists at Hacienda Nápoles Park in Puerto Triunfo, Colombia. Hacienda Nápoles was once a private zoo with illegally imported animals that belonged to drug trafficker Pablo Escobar. Photograph: Fernando Vergara/APBut after El Patrón was shot dead by police on a rooftop in his hometown of Medellín, Colombian authorities seized his estate and the animals on it. Most were shipped off to zoos, though the logistics of moving the four hippos – each weighing well over a metric ton – proved insurmountable, and they were left to wander the Andes.As many as 24 hippos have been sterilized so far, using Gonacon, an immunocontraceptive vaccine, which works temporarily but can cause permanent infertility. Originally, there were calls to cull Colombia’s hippo population, but in the end, sterilization was thought to be the more humane option.“Obviously you can’t let these hippos keep reproducing, which is what they’ll keep doing because they are in paradise,” said Enrique Zerda Ordóñez, a professor of biology at the National University of Colombia in Bogotá, adding: “They’ll always have water, all the plants they could ever want to eat, and they can pop out of the river and eat grass with the cows.”Rural farmers have grown fond of the wandering herd, charging tourists for a glance at the hippos that bathe on their lands, though one villager was injured last year after getting too close. Animal rights activists and conservationists have also sought to protect the hippos, vehemently protesting any initiatives to cull the animals.“This is only a pilot project, but something had to be done,” said Robin Poches, a biologist and businessman who helped the Colombian government secure a donation of 70 doses of Gonacon from the United States Department of Agriculture. “Otherwise it’s only a matter of time before someone gets seriously injured or killed.”The decision to medically sterilize the animals, rather than castrate them, will save money and time-consuming work.Castrating a hippo is no small feat, and costs about $7,000 for each animal. Hippos spend most of their time submerged in rivers, grazing on underwater flora, and only emerge at night, so the surgery would have to be performed after dark. A hippo’s reproductive organs are internal, so veterinarians have to carry out invasive procedures in order to neuter the animals.“The surgery itself isn’t the most complicated part – the tricky thing is anaesthetising them,” said Serna, who has castrated six hippos from the herd, knocking them out with tranquilizer darts that pierce 5cm (2in)-thick skin. “It requires a whole team of people and as we don’t have those drugs for such enormous creatures available in Colombia, it is very expensive.”The hippos are one of many enduring holdovers of Escobar’s reign of terror, which spanned from the late 70s until his death in 1993 and brought widespread murders and kidnappings. But for Serna, the animals should not be associated with the kingpin.“The hippos are not Escobar’s legacy, they are simply animals that escaped and bred and made a home in an environment that is not their own,” Serna said. “So to me, they don’t have anything to do with Escobar.”",2021-12-07

Its thundering ribbon of blue is cherished by kayakers, white-water rafters and the indigenous Innu people of Ekuanitshit. Earlier this year, in a first for Canada, the river was granted legal personhood by local authorities, and given nine rights, including the right to flow, the right to be safe from pollution – and the right to sue.Uapukun Mestokosho, a member of the Innu community who campaigned for the recognition of the Magpie’s rights said spending time on the river was “a form of healing” for indigenous people who could revive their traditional land-based practices that had been abandoned during the violence of the colonial era. “People are suffering a lot, with intergenerational traumas linked to the past,” Mestokosho told CBC. As well as this benefit for people, she said that her ancestors had always protected the Magpie, known as the Muteshekau-shipu, in the past, and a recognition of its rights would help protect it for future generations.The Magpie River in Canada has got the right to flow, but how you enforce that right is very unclearThe Magpie is one of a growing number of rivers to be recognised as a living entity across the world. The burgeoning rights-of-nature movement is pushing local, national and international authorities to recognise natural features – from lakes to mountains – in law, giving them either legal personhood or an independent right to flourish.Giving rivers the status of people – or more – in courts of law is enlivening environmentalism around the world. Ecuador started the movement when it enshrined rights of nature in its constitution in 2008. Countries such as Bolivia, Mexico and Colombia have created comparable legal mechanisms to protect nature, while New Zealand, Australia and Bangladesh have acted to protect rivers. In the United States, residents of Toledo drew up a bill of rights for Lake Erie. But can legal rights for nature protect it in reality? Who decides when a river can sue? Does it diminish the power of nature to squeeze it into the western legal system? Or do nature’s rights challenge the very foundations of capitalism?Western legal thinkers began probing the prevalent Enlightenment assumption that natural objects were simply property to be exploited in 1972 when a young professor of legal philosophy, Christopher Stone, argued that the environment should be considered as a subject and given legal personhood – as granted to corporations, for instance – with human guardians able to seek legal redress if a natural feature is damaged or destroyed. Today’s movement was ignited in 2017 when an act of parliament in New Zealand granted the whole Whanganui River rights as an independent entity, considering it an indivisible whole from source to sea. This was part of the treaty settlement between the government and the Māori people. Guardians were appointed to act and speak on behalf of the river and enforce its rights.But what is a river? Most would say not its banks but its flowing water. Unfortunately, the “elephant in the room,” says Dr Erin O’Donnell of the University of Melbourne and author of a book on rights for rivers, is the fact that none of the rivers legally recognised as living beings or legal persons actually have any rights to the water that flows within their banks.“There is increasingly an attempt to give rivers a right to flow and so the Magpie River in Canada has got the right to flow, but how you enforce that right is very unclear,” says O’Donnell. “And if that’s not actually embedded within water law, which it isn’t yet, then it’s probably not worth the paper it’s written on.”In New Zealand, the Whanganui treaty did not address this key issue, with a water company continuing to divert 80% of the river’s flow for hydropower until its licence expires in 2039. If this fact makes rights for rivers appear to be symbolism without legal teeth, O’Donnell and others argue that the concept still possesses real transformative power. In Canada, David Boyd, a professor of law and the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Environment, has said that legal personhood could succeed where decades of environmental laws have failed, kickstarting a cultural shift away from conceiving of nature as a “warehouse of commodities for human use”.In Australia, that shift is underway with regards to the Yarra, believes O’Donnell. The Yarra was recognised as a living, integrated entity as its traditional owners, the Wurundjeri people, had always known it, in a state act of parliament in 2017. Unlike Lake Erie and other locations in North America, the Yarra has not been made a legal person. “The upside of having legal personality is that you do have extra legal powers, so a river that is a legal person can go to court. The downside is that you immediately focus people’s attention on those rights and powers and expect the river to start using them,” says O’Donnell. “One of the first questions that I get asked almost every time I speak publicly about the issue of rivers having rights is, ‘Can we sue the river when it floods?’” As soon as Lake Erie was granted rights in the United States, farmers – concerned that measures to stop fertilisers running into the lake would threaten their businesses – challenged it in court.Having the Yarra recognised as a living entity sounds like a weaker step than legal personhood, but it still has “the most transformative potential in terms of the way that people relate to the river,” argues O’Donnell. Until very recently, the river was a resource to exploit: a source of water, a stormwater drain and a sewer. “When we see the river as a living being, is that when we start to say, hang on, what do we want for the river? That’s the genuine conversational shift I’m seeing with the Yarra away from this western resource extraction model to seeking a partnership with the river in its own management.”Some rights-of-nature sceptics argue that it simply can’t fit into western law, which upholds capitalism, property rights and extracting profit from the Earth’s resources. After Ecuador incorporated rights of nature into its constitution, in 2011 a provincial court ruled in favour of the Vilcabamba River against damaging road construction. The river won in court but the developer didn’t actually take the action required to remediate the pollution. Ecuador’s courts have since held more than three dozen lawsuits in the name of nature. Many have been successful but verdicts have not always been enforced on the ground.In India, a state high court tried to give the Ganges and Yamuna River legal personhood in 2017, but the decision was appealed to the supreme court. Campaigners are still waiting for the verdict while the rivers continue to be polluted and exploited.Deep feeling: in 2017 the New Zealand parliament granted Whanganui River rights as an independent entity, an indivisible whole from source to sea. Photograph: Oliver Strewe/Getty ImagesRights of nature are being asserted most powerfully in post-colonial countries where indigenous people strive to protect traditional lands. But some indigenous campaigners view legal personhood and “rights” for nature as western constructs. “The use of rights doesn’t quite fit into the teachings of many indigenous people,” says Michelle Bender of the Earth Law Center, an influential co-operative based in the United States. “Nature is the source of life, it’s already an entity to be respected and so some people say we don’t need this recognition of rights. To be clear, the rights of nature movement is learning from an indigenous worldview rather than the other way around. The use of rights of nature can help to reorient the law around indigenous relationships and responsibilities to nature.”Europe lags behind other continents where indigenous people have challenged western concepts of owning and exploiting nature. In Britain, nature’s rights briefly emerged in 2018 when Frome town council, run by community-minded independent councillors, proposed to pass a bylaw recognising the rights of their stretch of the River Frome and water-meadows to remain pollution-free. Belatedly, in 2020, central government said that the council could not pass its bylaw because they judged it duplicated existing environmental protections.Mumta Ito, the founder of Nature’s Rights and a former environmental lawyer based in Scotland, says it is not possible to make local laws in Britain as municipalities can in North America. “Then you get the backlash, the voices that say it doesn’t work,” she says. “Of course it doesn’t work. How can one part of the River Frome have rights when the stretch flowing through the next county doesn’t? All you can achieve with these local-level laws is raise awareness.”How can one part of the River Frome have rights when the stretch flowing through the next county doesn’t?Ito argues that we can’t simply drop the rights of nature into the current legal system, but require much more fundamental change. Ultimately the law must recognise that nature’s rights come first, followed by human rights and then corporate rights because without living systems such as clean water, air and fertile soils there is no human life. “We are an intrinsic part of nature and our human right to life emanates from the rights of nature. All human rights exist because of nature. It’s irrational to say we have rights to life or property rights if nature’s rights are not achieved. But we have an economic system that undermines the natural system that we come from.”00:02:40A living being: The Whanganui River – videoSuch radical legal changes would probably require us to uproot established western concepts of property rights, individualism and ceaseless economic growth. “Where do we start?” says Ito. “We should start with common sense. People becoming connected with nature is really going to help. All of us have experienced how good we feel being in the forest or by the sea. It’s hard to get people to care about something if they don’t make the connection.”Rather than battling at a local level in Britain, Ito is examining how the EU could recognise rights of nature. Ito says EU commissioners and legislators are paying attention. “At least they are willing to hear what we’ve got to say.”Other rights of nature advocates are also setting their sights higher. Rivers cross state and national borders and most are boundary-less, ultimately flowing into the sea. Protecting oceans looks a particularly daunting task, but Michelle Bender argues that it may be easier to assert nature’s rights here because no one owns the high seas. Rights of nature don’t conflict with property rights so oceans could more easily be recognised as an independent legal entity. “The ocean would own herself and decisions would be made considering her wellbeing and impact on all life, rather than just the piecemeal approach that’s currently used,” says Bender. There could be a seat for the ocean at the UN or a council of ocean guardians who are legally responsible for representing the ocean’s needs. They could set standards for a “healthy” ocean.In some respects, new rights of nature laws resemble the “net zero” emissions targets set by governments, councils and corporations: worthy aspirations yet to translate into decisive action and change in real life. There is also a chicken-and-egg element to this debate: can law change popular consciousness or is it doomed to fail if it doesn’t simply prop up existing values?Campaigners believe the law can and does change the way we think. For Ito, her ambitious pursuit of rights for nature is not nearly as frustrating as her years as an environmental lawyer seeking to defend nature using inadequate existing structures. “At least on this I’ll be able to look my grandchildren in the eye and say I did what I could,” she says. “The changes in the legal system deeply affect the psyche. If the law says I’m in relationship with the ocean and the river then it won’t be long before people start behaving as if we are interconnected with the other life forms on the planet.”",2021-07-26
InterviewRichard Mabey: 'Viruses and man-eating tigers and predatory Asian hornets are all part of nature'Patrick Barkham,"A pioneer of British nature writing, Richard Mabey has always been years ahead of his time. So how does he think the pandemic will change our relationship to the natural world?",['@patrick_barkham'],"After a year of virus-plagued humans observing with new wonder how wildlife boosts our wellbeing, the conclusion of the man who invented the burgeoning “nature cure” genre is unexpected. Nature, declares Richard Mabey, makes us ill. He was first told this by his fellow writer, Kathleen Jamie, and it made Mabey “think very much more deeply about the whole panoply of what ‘nature’ means,” he says. “Bacteria and viruses and man-eating tigers and predatory Asian hornets are also all part of nature. At times we need to defend ourselves from ‘nature’ but also row back from the value judgments we make about certain parts of the natural world, because we need the whole thing kicking together if the biosphere, including us, is to survive.”Mabey, who has just celebrated his 80th birthday, has been a pioneer in British nature writing and environmental thinking for five decades. He is not a contrarian but has consistently interrogated and challenged prevailing patterns of thinking in more than 30 books (so many it is difficult to conclusively count them). Nature is a “criminally abused word”, he says. And he criticises the simplicity of the assumption that we have been reconnecting with nature in the wake of the pandemic’s lockdowns. “I’m particularly aroused by this term ‘reconnection with nature’, given that we are all every moment every breath of our lives very connected with it. I hate to say any words in support of our great leader but at one point during lockdown Boris Johnson used the phrase: ‘We must be humble in the face of nature.’ He was thereby putting the pandemic on the side of nature. As we hopefully mature in our understandings of our relationship with the world outside, we have to move towards a much more broad-based concept of what nature means. When people say: ‘Yeah! Go out and reconnect with nature! Nature makes you well!’ in fact they are just talking about a cherry-picked selection – trees and birds and flowers.”While many of us have spent the pandemic worrying hugely, Mabey, who describes himself as “naturally a really quite anxious person” has been mentally untroubled by coronavirus. Instead, locked down at his home with his partner, Polly, on the Norfolk-Suffolk border, he’s been thinking. Now, invigorated by #Mabeymonth on Twitter – an appreciation devised by fellow writers Tim Dee, Mark Cocker and Jamie – Mabey is ready to start the book of big ideas he regrets not writing sooner.Mabey at Perry Oaks Sewage Farm, now turned into Terminal 5, Heathrow, in 1974. Photograph: Tony Evans/Timelapse Library Ltd./Getty ImagesIn an era when bookshops are thickly forested with new nature tomes, it is easy to forget that for decades Mabey, in Britain, was a lone voice in an empty field. He grew up, a “hedge kid” roaming the countryside around Berkhamsted, for whom nature was a refuge from a bed-ridden, alcoholic father who ruled the household as if by remote control. Writing has always been how Mabey makes sense of things, and keeps well. When his father died, “I thought that I really wouldn’t care less whether he was alive or not”, but two hours after the funeral Mabey “sat in my room and just wrote pages and pages on blue Basildon Bond paper about what I’d been feeling. I couldn’t have gone through the rest of the day if I hadn’t done that.”In the early 1960s, Mabey joined the political protests of the day – arrested during street demos, against the Cuban missile crisis – but it was visiting the Norfolk coast where he encountered traditional foraging for food such as samphire that moved him to write Food for Free (1972), which pre-dates Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall’s advocacy of wild food by three decades. Mabey, who cites Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring and Annie Dillard’s Pilgrim at Tinker Creek as his key texts, has been consistently trailblazing. His second book, The Unofficial Countryside (1973), is a memorable celebration of wildlife in rubbish dumps and waste ground that foreshadowed other British writers’ interest in “edgelands” by 40 years. His biography of Gilbert White (1986) and epic cultural history of plants, Flora Britannica (1996), are key texts in the revival of nature writing in Britain. More recently, Mabey’s Nature Cure (2005), detailing his mental breakdown after finishing Flora Britannica and the succour he found by belatedly leaving behind his childhood home in the Chilterns for the bleaker south Norfolk countryside, heralded that genre of nature misery memoir.The Cabaret of Plants: Botany and the Imagination by Richard Mabey review –  a hymn to flower powerRead moreEighteen months ago, after a period of poor physical health, Mabey published what sounded like his last ever book, with a suitably elegiac title, Turning the Boat for Home. An expanded collection of 20 years of writing, he calls it “an intellectual autobiography” but admits it sprang from failure. “I badly wanted to write what I thought would be a last book. Some sort of summing up of a life. But I very quickly confirmed that I don’t have the right sort of mind or memory to do what people regard as autobiographies.”The collection is a reminder of his essayistic talents, from a gorgeous ferret into his bookshelves, which possess “the rampant wildness of an ecosystem, with an agenda of its own”, to an examination of how we might better relate to barn owls, birdsong and whirligig beetles. The most respectful terms of engagement, he argues, are not “anthropomorphism or manufactured empathy” but “a sense of neighbourliness”. This is not friendship but “based on sharing a place, on the common experience of home and habitat and season”. “It might provide a bridge across the great conceptual divide between us and other species.”White rosebay willowherb. Photograph: Susie WhiteNeighbourliness is “just scratching the surface” Mabey says. He is delighted by his friend Robert Macfarlane’s essay exploring “the new animism”. “I think this is the new intellectual frontier,” he says. “If there is one deep regret of my life, it is that I’ve never done a book of a big idea. I’ve always been frightened of them, partly because a bit of me doesn’t believe in big ideas because they tend to lead to dogmatism and ideology, and nature works in small ideas, little adjustments. But I think there is a germ of a big idea about how we frame our relationship with these other beings on our planet.”Richard Mabey – how plants thinkRead moreHe wants to probe these relationships more closely in a book rooted in the plants of his “home acres” around the Waveney valley. “OK, you’re face to face with a violet helleborine in a wood you know very well. What is going on between you and it? How are you framing its existence in relation to your own? Do you have any thoughts about what the violet helleborine may be perceiving about your presence – your scent molecules, your carbon dioxide emissions? There’s a transaction going on, which is different from the transactions we have with other conscious beings but which is there nonetheless.”Another big issue he wants to explore is the philosophical basis of rewilding. “Can we return to a pre-human landscape, the one that was in Britain before neolithic farming began? Because that’s being used as a kind of baseline for the condition and the species that we ought to have in this island. Or are we, in George Peterken’s great phrase, looking for a ‘future nature’? By rewilding, are we going towards simply a deliciously unknown state where we don’t know what will happen and we take the brakes off and allow natural processes to take their course? In which case, we probably end up with something quite different from the past nature, the neolithic pre-farming condition.”Mabey has been struggling to devise a structure for these explorations but just a week ago was struck that he could write them as a series of letters, like Gilbert White’s seminal The Natural History of Selborne. “The epistolary form has not been particularly well worked in nonfiction,” he says. “It gives you a way of bringing lots of subjects both theoretically and domestically together in a really conversational tone, rather than just preaching, which any philosophical discussion can lead you into.”A hellebore in woodland. Photograph: Dmitry Feoktistov/TASSFor all his scepticism about the idea that “nature makes us well”, to my surprise Mabey does not dismiss the view that we are currently enjoying a changed relationship with other species. “I’m absolutely sure that it’s a real phenomenon. It’s quite plain that people did have an unusual response to the natural world during lockdown and are still having that,” he says.He identifies two new aspects to this. One is the feeling that nature is doing “marvellously well without us” – trees blooming, birds singing – and isn’t that wonderful. In the past, says Mabey, signs of nature prospering during human suffering were resented. “I’m thinking of TS Eliot’s ‘April is the cruellest month’ after the first world war. He was suggesting that the spectacle of lilacs blooming was offensive to people who wanted to wallow in the misery of what was happening.” When Mabey researched Weeds (2010) – another book a decade ahead of its time – he found that the spectacle of rosebay willowherb blooming in the ruins of bomb blasted British cities during the second world war was again greeted as if “nature” was adding “insult to injury”.Weeds by Richard Mabey – reviewRead more“The second thing that’s new is the minuteness of the attention brought to bear on other species,” says Mabey. “I’ve found this myself. Wandering around the garden, I’m seeing things that I’m ashamed to say I’ve not focused on before – the particular mechanisms of a leaf bud opening up, or dozens of Harlequin ladybirds scurrying on a lichen-covered ash tree. They looked like herbivores grazing on a lichen forest. This seems to be tied to the first thing. When you admit that nature in the very broadest sense seems to be doing OK – and isn’t that hopeful for the whole planet – it draws you into a more wondrous attention to what it is doing.”",2021-03-27
Can 3D-printed tiger teeth help save our rarest animals from extinction?,A startup making replicas is giving Indigenous people in India an alternative to using wild animal parts in traditional headgear,"['The age of extinction is supported by', 'About this content', 'Aatreyee Dhar']","In the lowland rainforests of Arunachal Pradesh in north-east India, tigers, clouded leopards, eagles and hornbills dot the landscape. The area is also home to the Nyishi community, the largest Indigenous tribe in the state, where the men traditionally don a byopa, an elaborate handwoven cane cap with the upper beak and casque of a great hornbill attached to the top edge, and an eagle’s claw at the back. They also wield a machete fitted either with the short, squat jaw of the clouded leopard or the much larger one of a tiger.“The tiger rules the jungle. The eagle rules the sky. Wearing their parts implies inhabiting their mighty spirit, protecting the people. It’s a status symbol,” says Nabam Bapu, an entrepreneur from the Nyishi tribe based in the state’s Papum Pare district.But hunting rare animals and wearing their body parts when wildlife numbers are declining in the state has always troubled Bapu. In January 2020, he teamed up with his friend Anang Tadar, a tech innovator, to provide an alternative to the traditional headgear by replicating the animal parts using a 3D printer.Arunachal Ivory and Ornaments has produced more than 100 replicas of animal parts, including the teeth of the clouded leopard. Photograph: AfriPics.com/Alamy“It took us two years to source raw materials for the product, from an array of synthetic resin to plastic materials, wood and fire-resistant glass,” says Tadar. “We are exploring the use of plant-based and eco-friendly resin as well.”The enterprise is one of a number of projects worldwide that aims to protect the traditions of local communities while also protecting animals from being killed for their pelts and parts.In southern Africa, Panthera, a wildcat conservation charity, launched its Furs for Life programme in 2013, creating synthetic leopard fur to replace real leopard skins used for capes, known as heritage furs or amambatha.The charity estimates that the project has led to a 50% reduction in the use of real leopard skins for the capes, which are used by followers of Shembe, one of the largest Indigenous churches in South Africa.Once a month in Arunachal Pradesh, Bapu and Tadar hike along miles of dirt roads to take their latest samples to their village elders for consultation. “It is important to have the village elders check on their quality as only they can give the right approval on their proximity to a real animal part as they have been hunting for ages,” says Tadar.Arunachal Ivory and Ornaments’ technical consultant Anang Tadar (left), and the company’s founders, Likha Nana and Nabam Bapu. Photograph: Arunachal Ivory and OrnamentsSo far, Arunachal Ivory and Ornaments, the startup company launched by Bapu along with Likha Nana, a history researcher and Bapu’s wife, has produced more than 100 replicas of the milk-white teeth of the clouded leopard and the tiger, the off-white teeth of wild boar, and the neon-yellow talons of the eagle. They are currently working on 3D printouts of a great Indian hornbill’s beak.The state of Arunachal Pradesh is home to 26 major tribes, including the Nyishi, Adi, Galo, Apatani and Tagin. Amid fears that their culture and traditional practices are on the wane, the Arunachal state government encourages students to wear traditional dress every Friday and for government workers to do so once a month. As a result, wild animal parts remain in high demand.A replica of an eagle’s talons, a symbolic part of headgear traditionally worn by men in the Nyishi community.  Photograph: Arunachal Ivory and Ornaments“Not everyone can afford the wild animal parts. Can you imagine the price of tiger teeth on the black market? It’s in the range of 400,000 to 500,000 rupees [£3,800-£4,700],” says Bapu.While the authorities are trying to combat poaching and the global illegal wildlife trade – the state shares international borders with Myanmar in the east and China in the north – “monitoring poaching activities can be a daunting task,” says Tana Tapi, deputy chief wildlife warden of Arunachal Pradesh, who is based in the state capital, Itanagar.Why are India’s lions increasingly swapping the jungle for the beach?Read moreArunachal Ivory and Ornaments is hoping to play its part in the fight against this illegal trade. Rajkamal Goswami, a researcher who has worked in conservation in north-east India for a decade, says: “Success of such designs will depend on how they are adopted by the local communities. The entrepreneurs should try and convince the influential local institutions to adopt such products to make real differences in the extent and intensities of hunting.”Bapu is sure that his company can make a difference. “If people are shooting wild animals mercilessly using hi-tech guns,” he says, “why not use technology for a greater purpose: to save wildlife and restore cultural practices.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",2023-08-03
Catalonia’s farmers face threat of drought … and a plague of hungry rabbits,"With water reserves running low, Spanish farmers are also struggling to protect crops from thousands of rabbits starved of fresh grass","['The age of extinction is supported by', 'About this content', 'Stephen Burgen', '  in Barcelona']","With much of Spain facing severe drought after an exceptionally dry winter that followed the hottest summer on record, Alex Foix is planting vines in dusty ground near the village of Verdú in the province of Lleida. He hopes to have enough water for the vines to survive their first year, but that is not his only worry: it is the rabbits he fears most.Unusually, the area worst affected by drought isn’t in the south of the country but in the north-east region of Catalonia, where – in addition to a severe water shortage – farmers are facing a plague of rabbits. With a lack of grass and water, the animals are destroying crops, especially young wheat and barley, and eating the bark on vines and fruit trees.“A lot of factors have contributed to the rabbit population explosion: there was the pandemic, when no one could hunt for two years; they’ve become immune to myxomatosis; and the female can produce seven or eight offspring every two months,” Foix says.Samboda checks his crops for damage caused by rabbits. Photograph: Paola de Grenet/The GuardianThe Catalan government has said that more than 250,000 rabbits need to be killed by September to contain the population, according to reports, but it is a task beyond the means of the region’s disappearing breed of aged hunters.In an effort to reduce the numbers, the government has permitted the use of aluminium phosphate, which releases toxic phosphine gas when introduced into burrows.“If it doesn’t rain in April and we have another year like last year, the vines won’t survive,” says Juan Samboda, a member of Pagesos o conills (Farmers or rabbits), who grows cereals, vines, olives and chickpeas near Verdú.Drought is endemic in Lleida, says Samboda, but he points with pride to the area’s modern irrigation system, which is driven almost entirely by gravity. A series of small reservoirs are supplied with water from the Segarra-Garrigues canal. The problem is the water for the canal comes from the Rialb reservoir, 75km away. Standing on the bridge over the reservoir there is no sign of water but rather an improvised race track for trail bikes.In Catalonia as a whole, water reserves are down to about 26% and Samboda and his neighbours are running out.The depleted Rialb reservoir. In Catalonia as a whole, water reserves are down to about 26%. Photograph: Paola de Grenet/The Guardian“The question is how to manage the resources we have,” says Josep Carles Vicente, an olive farmer in Priorat, 60km south-west of Verdú. “If we decide that this year we can only cultivate a quarter of the available land then we have to decide what crops to prioritise. It’s vital that we don’t just improvise from day to day.“If the drought continues, in the case of fruit trees we can irrigate enough to save the trees but not enough for them to bear fruit.”At the end of February, a number of measures were agreed by the Catalan government, including a 40% reduction in water used for agriculture, a 15% reduction for industrial use, and a cut in the average daily supply for each resident from 250 litres to 230 litres.There is a ban on using drinking water to irrigate parks and gardens or for street cleaning, and plans to increase the amount of recycled water that can be introduced into rivers. An emergency plan allows local authorities to contract water tankers.The empty Segarra-Garrigues canal, which supplies a series of reservoirs in the area. Photograph: Paola de Grenet/The GuardianHowever, a cross-party emergency water summit held late last month failed to reach agreement on further restrictions. Municipal elections are due in May and – anxious to please voters – local mayors argued that municipal swimming pools be kept open on health grounds. They also blocked a proposal to fine local councils that exceed their water quota.Days of wine and olives: how the old farming ways are paying off in SpainRead moreSome farmers have been learning to adapt to the changing conditions. Marta Casas, oenologist at Parés Baltà winery in Penedès, near Barcelona, says global heating over the past 20 years has brought the grape harvest forward from late August to late July.“We’ve noticed that if we leave ground cover around the vines they are better equipped to survive drought because the morning dew doesn’t just settle on the leaves but on the grass, too,” she says.Farmers are turning to grape varieties more resilient to drought but the damage caused by rabbits remains a problem. Photograph: Paola de Grenet/The GuardianCasas adds that the winery is opting for grape varieties with a longer growing cycle, as the increasingly harsh climate affects the taste, aroma and sugar content of the grapes. This has led them to replace French varieties such as merlot and chardonnay with native vines such as sumoll, moneu and malvasia sitges.But the plague of rabbits may not be so easy to combat. “One study found areas where there were 100 times what is considered the stable population of rabbit an acre,” says Foix, pointing to the protective plastic sleeves he’s fitted to each young vine in the hope of keeping them at bay.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",2023-04-24
 Climate experts give cautious welcome to Labour’s green policies,"Party must not back away from ensuring rapid transition to low-carbon economy, say campaigners",['Matthew Taylor'],"Climate experts and campaigners have given a cautious welcome to Labour’s proposals to tackle the escalating ecological crisis but urged the party not to back away from a broader “green new deal” agenda to ensure a rapid and fair transition to a low-carbon economy.During its party conference in Brighton, Labour set out measures including an annual £28bn green investment fund, a mass retrofitting programme, a pledge to decarbonise steel and a “net zero and nature test” for every policy.The headline plans echoed many of Labour’s initiatives for a green industrial revolution that were set out in detail at the last election. Many experts applauded the scale of the proposals, describing them as “a good first step” to ensure the UK meets its climate targets.Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, has been leading Labour’s push on climate and in his speech to conference promised it would be the party of “climate justice and economic justice together”.However, some campaigners said the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, needed to explicitly back a “transformational green new deal” – including the nationalisation of key industries, which he ruled out this week – to ensure the transition to a low-carbon economy was conducted at sufficient speed and scale to tackle the climate crisis and, crucially, improve the lives of ordinary people through better jobs, improved housing and public health.On Friday it was reported that allies of Starmer were pushing him to demote Miliband, with one party source telling the Times the shadow business secretary was “veering away from his brief in a strange way”.Labour said there were no current plans for a reshuffle, and any move against Miliband – a well-respected environment secretary in the last Labour government and former party leader – would be met with dismay by climate experts and many party members. It would also dent Labour’s credentials before Cop26, the international climate summit in Glasgow in November.Climate experts welcomed the party’s plans on Friday. Sam Alvis, the head of green renewal at the Green Alliance thinktank, which last month calculated the government needed to spend an extra £22bn a year to meet the UK’s climate goals, said: “This is a big increase in ambition that would go a long way in getting to net zero carbon emissions and restoring nature … [it] puts pressure on chancellor Rishi Sunak to follow suit with a similar programme in the spending review.”Simon Cran-McGreehin, the head of analysis at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said it would be important to see the details behind the headlines, but added the plans were broadly in line with those set out by the government’s own advisers on the Climate Change Committee.“The overall figure of £28bn is in the right sort of area to ramp us up to where we need to be between now and 2030 … it is a good first step.”Rebecca Newsom, the head of politics at Greenpeace UK, also welcomed the policies, saying it was clear “that tackling the climate crisis and supporting a fair transition” was central to Labour’s agenda.But she said “big questions” remained around the “speed and nature of the transition” under any future Labour government and the party’s readiness to show “real leadership in guiding a just transition away from dirty, expensive and unreliable technologies like oil, gas and nuclear”.Climate and social justice activists inside and outside the party said that, although the policies did not go far enough, they highlighted the power of their campaigning over the past two years – from school strikes to Green New Deal Rising, Extinction Rebellion to Labour for a Green New Deal – and vowed to continue to push the party to go further.Hannah Martin from Green New Deal Rising, the youth climate movement that challenged Starmer over his climate commitments during conference, said the spending commitment “only happened because of the activism of young people”.Green party in England and Wales unveils new leadership duoRead more“While it’s a good first step towards the level of investment we need, we still have a leader of the opposition who is running away from young people and won’t talk to us about this crisis.”Martin said her generation had faced multiple crises, including recessions, pandemics, climate breakdown and rising poverty.She added: “We know that only a wide-reaching green new deal at the speed and scale required where we transform our financial systems and put power back into the hands of communities is going to work and we need leaders who have the courage to fight for it.”Kate Hicks, from the grassroots campaign group Labour for a Green New Deal, said the party had taken a “big step back from 2019”.“Labour should be the party of green jobs, but Starmer has ditched the policy he needs to achieve it: public ownership. Without it, we can’t wind down polluting industries at the pace that’s needed, and we can’t make sure that workers are retrained for quality, well-paid jobs.”Delegates at the Labour conference overwhelmingly backed a motion calling for the party to adopt a series of radical climate policies including the nationalisation of the energy sector, the creation of a “national nature service”, “a government programme creating millions of well-paid, unionised green jobs with publicly owned entities” and “mass investment in green technologies and renewables”.Hicks said this showed there was still “a huge and growing wave of grassroots support behind a transformative green new deal”.“Some, like Ed Miliband, appear to recognise this, and we urge the rest of the leadership to follow his lead,” she added.",2021-10-01
Country diary: thatched roofs’ purple secret is revealed,"Paignton harbour, Devon: Thatch is a welcoming home for many fungi, as it provides the damp conditions they thrive in",['Tom Allan'],"I had seen it so often I almost didn’t pause to look. I was re-ridging a thatched house on Paignton seafront. Below me and to my right was the old stone-built harbour; to my left, an arc of red sand beach backed by the Torbay arcades and beach huts as bright as boiled sweets. It seemed an unlikely place to find a rare woodland species.But as I pulled off the thin lengths of ash that make up the diamond pattern on the old ridge (on top of the roof), there it was – the familiar bright purple pattern, spreading in blotches across the dead wood. I see this growth on over half the thatched roofs I work on in Devon. I have always assumed it is a lichen of some sort. But what is it?‘I learned that it isn’t a lichen at all, but a crustose fungus, Terana caerulea – the cobalt crust.’ Photograph: Tom AllanI took a photo, and called on the help of Twitter. I learned that it isn’t a lichen at all, but a crustose fungus, Terana caerulea – the cobalt crust. It is, according to Brian Eversham from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire Wildlife Trust, rarely recorded in south-west England (most UK records are from south Wales). Brian warns that it may become even rarer as another fungus – the Hymenoscyphus fraxineus that causes ash dieback – reduces populations of its favoured tree.Thatch is a welcoming home for all sorts of fungi, as it provides the damp conditions they thrive in. Welcoming, but impermanent: ridges are stripped and replaced every 10 or so years in Devon, roofs rethatched every 20 to 25 years. Moss and lichen are often removed with a mechanical hedge trimmer to aid water runoff (doing this also removes an inch or so of reed, so in my view it is usually best avoided). But in spite of thatchers’ attempts to remove them, fungal bodies always find a way back to the roof.My purple cobalt crust seemed too beautiful to throw away, so I slipped the piece of ash wood into my pocket and took it home. It’s sitting in front of me as I write, in the dark of a cool clay jar. A little duller perhaps, but still unmistakably crusty and unmistakably purple.

 This article is more than 7 months oldAn extra $1.3bn to upgrade Australia’s energy-inefficient homes might not do much – here’s what would helpThis article is more than 7 months oldTristan Edis,"Taking on vested interests and mandating housing energy ratings and minimum standards are far more important steps

",,"In the recent federal budget, it was announced that $1bn would be allocated to provide discounted loans to households to upgrade the energy efficiency of their homes and replace gas appliances with electric ones. A further $300m was provided for states to upgrade the energy efficiency of social housing.This was intended to deliver on a promise the Albanese Labor government made in exchange for the Greens agreeing to caps on gas prices – in effect subsidising its cost below international prices.According to the government, the package “will focus on households that most need support, such as low-income households [and] renters”. The federal government observed in its budget papers that “Australian homes are largely inefficient – Australia ranks 58 out of 63 countries on energy use per capita”.Households offered $1bn help in budget to install energy saving measures Read moreThe $300m allocated to upgrading energy efficiency for 60,000 social housing properties is very badly needed. State governments have not shown themselves to be particularly enlightened landlords. Their tenants are consigned to housing which the federal government notes has some of the worst levels of energy efficiency in Australia. But what about the remaining 380,000 social housing properties – more than 85% – that remain untouched?In terms of the remaining $1bn to be allocated as loans, do we now expect renters to take out loans to upgrade their landlord’s properties?

One thing is for sure – very few landlords will take up these loans, because they don’t have to pay their tenant’s energy bills. Over many decades and across many countries, the universal experience is that landlords do not undertake energy efficiency upgrades unless they are required to by law.Yet even in the case of those who own their own home, providing them with loans is just a small part of an effective solution to our poor standard of housing.We already have government funding supporting loans for energy upgrades, and have for many years. The government’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation has been providing funding to a range of lending organisations that provide discounted finance to build or buy homes with high energy efficiency ratings or to finance energy-efficient equipment and solar systems. If these lenders were being overwhelmed with demand, then the Clean Energy Finance Corporation could easily give them more. That’s because the CEFC can draw down on around $4.5bn currently sitting in its account with the Treasury, so there’s serious question marks about whether an extra billion will make much difference.Don’t get me wrong, provision of low-cost finance can be a useful tool in driving energy efficiency, but there are other policy tools, which receive a glancing reference in the budget, which are vastly more important. The issue though for politicians is that to use them effectively would require courage to take on entrenched interests in the real estate lobby and manufacturers who have failed to modernise their product offerings.00:03:39The Green Recovery: how to fix Australia's energy-inefficient homes – videoThe first step is we must raise awareness among the community about just how poorly Australian housing performs. This requires prominent energy rating labels to be applied to advertisements whenever a home is put up for sale or lease. Few people appreciate that a large proportion of Australian homes probably rate around two stars or less out of a 10-point scale. At present, such ratings are being rolled out on a voluntary basis (except in the ACT). A small number of high-performing homes will seek out a rating, and the remaining, vast majority of homes that perform badly will get no rating.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But they then wilted under lobbying pressure from the real estate industry.This builder used to be sceptical about green homes. Now he’s a convertRead moreIn addition, we need to implement minimum energy-efficiency standards for rental properties. The ACT government has made a great start by recently requiring minimum ceiling insulation levels. But ideally regulations should encourage upgrades to heaters and water heaters, and the adoption of solar and batteries if we really want to help reduce energy bills for renters. Other state governments, in particular Victoria, are considering implementing new standards. However, they will need to show some spine when they come up against the inevitable threats of a scare campaign from real estate agents.The federal government could also help. Landlords receive very generous tax breaks for investing in property, which economists have pointed out over many years deliver little to no net economic benefit. The government has ruled out curtailing these tax breaks. But at the very least it could require that landlords’ properties meet a minimum standard of energy efficiency in return for receiving these tax breaks.This is where a loan program becomes useful. If landlords claim they can’t afford to undertake upgrades, government can point them to their discounted loans, plus the fact the interest expense is tax deductible.

 Is a Madagascan mine the first to offset its destruction of rainforest?,Researchers say the island’s biggest mine is on track to achieve no net loss of forest but that ‘there remain important caveats’,"['The age of extinction is supported by', 'About this content', 'Patrick Greenfield', '@pgreenfielduk']","Ambatovy mine on the east coast of Madagascar is an environmental conundrum fit for the 21st century. Beginning operations in 2012, the multibillion-dollar open-pit nickel and cobalt mine is the largest investment in the history of the country, one of the poorest on Earth. About 9,000 Malagasies are employed by the project, owned by the Japanese company Sumitomo Corporation and Korean firm Komir, which mines minerals destined for the world’s electric car batteries. To construct the mine and the 140-mile (220km) slurry pipeline to port on the Indian ocean, 2,000 hectares (5,000 acres) of pristine rainforest was cleared, destroying vital habitat of the endangered indri, the largest living lemur, and thousands of other species.Alongside the land clearing in a country that has lost nearly a quarter of its tree cover since 2000, the mine has been blamed for air and water pollution, as well as health problems in the local population. The smell of ammonia in residential areas and the pollution of drinking water were revealed in a 2017 investigation.But now the project is set to gain another controversial accolade: the first mine to successfully offset the destruction it caused to a forest, according to an independent scientific study.map of offset areasIn a wild west of environmental claims, research published in Nature Sustainability, led by scientists at Bangor University, is likely to be contentious.The theory behind offsetting is that good can cancel out bad. In carbon offsetting, polluters can pay to neutralise emissions from flying or driving by paying for equivalent emission reductions elsewhere. With biodiversity offsetting, the destruction of an ecosystem can be counteracted by protecting another threatened area.Guardian writer George Monbiot has compared offsetting to the sale of indulgences by the Catholic church in the 16th century, when sinners could, in effect, pay to cancel out their bad deeds.Evidence that most offsets do what they claim to do is scarce. “Over 12,000 biodiversity offsets exist worldwide, yet evaluations of their effectiveness are rare and most do not use robust methods,” according to the study of Ambatovy’s offsets.About 2,000 hectares of rainforest was cleared to build Ambatovy mine. Photograph: Jonathan Watts/The GuardianThe researchers say Ambatovy is on track to protect an area of rainforest equivalent to the amount it destroyed in other parts of the island.Scientists used statistical analysis to compare the four offsetting schemes established by the mine with similar areas of threatened forest not under protection. The researchers say 1,644 hectares was protected between 2009 and January 2020 by the mine’s conservation schemes, and that if continued at the same rate, 2,174 hectares of rainforest loss would have been avoided by the end of 2021, fully offsetting the destruction at the mine site.“This is a really encouraging result. It suggests that the really large contributions the mine makes to the Malagasy economy can be achieved while minimising tradeoffs with the unique forest habitat,” says lead author Katie Devenish.How the mine is offsetting its forest destructionsliderThe yellow outline depicts one of the four offset areas. High deforestation rates before the project (shown in orange) slowed inside the offset area once it was created, while trees continued to be cleared elsewhere (shown in blue), according to the study. But the researchers add that “there remain important caveats”. First, the result shows how difficult and expensive biodiversity offsetting is, according to the scientists. Although no official figures were published, it is understood the offsets were backed by heavy investment from the mine, to protect an area of rainforest smaller than most London boroughs.“Ambatovy is interesting to study, in part because it is a flagship project. It’s not in any way representative of most offsets. This isn’t a get-out-of-jail-free card for mines and dams in important biodiversity areas. Offsetting is really hard. The company had to work really, really hard to achieve those biodiversity gains,” says Julia Jones, a conservation professor at Bangor University, and study co-author.This isn’t a get-out-of-jail-free card for mines and dams in important biodiversity areas. Offsetting is really hardProf Julia Jones, study co-author“This study should encourage companies to invest more in avoidance and minimisation because if they’re genuinely going to have to offset unavoidable impacts, it’s going to be really hard and expensive,” Jones says.Second, the burden of offsetting falls on vulnerable people who depend on the forest for their livelihoods – forcing them to change their behaviour – rather than the mine, say researchers. The reductions in the Ambatovy offsets were gained by slowing land clearing by subsistence farmers in other areas.“The poorest people most dependent on the forests are the ones that will bear the cost of achieving no net loss outcomes because they can no longer exploit the forest in the way that they traditionally did,” says Martine Maron, a professor at the University of Queensland and author of a paper on the many meanings of no net loss in 2018, who was not involved in the study.Scientists have warned that much of the burden of offsetting falls on vulnerable people who are dependent on the forest. Photograph: Vincent Muracciole“It’s an issue that has to be solved because we can’t be beholden to tradeoffs between people and nature. We’ve got to find solutions that work for both,” she says.Dr Sarobidy Rakotonarivo, an environmental socioeconomist and fellow at the Forest4Climate&People project at Bangor University, has studied the impact of conservation policies on people in eastern Madagascar. She says there has been too little investment in livelihoods and food security.“All too often, I think there is this lack of understanding about how much is needed to support people reliant on subsistence agriculture,” she says.Many agree there is the need for more research on offsetting schemes. While they underpin the environmental commitments of some of the biggest companies on Earth, all too often it is unclear whether the projects are having any impact on the environment.Deforestation emissions far higher than previously thought, study findsRead moreSophus zu Ermgassen, an ecological economist at the University of Kent, who was not involved in the latest research, says: “The paper is awesome. It is at the very cutting edge methodologically as it’s really hard to know if nature conservation works.“Offsetting can be done but it cannot be overstated how unique this case is and how much resource needs to go into making it work – levels of resourcing that nearly all state or national biodiversity offsetting policies fail to provide,” he says.Ambatovy has welcomed the report and told the Guardian: “Ambatovy is committed to acting in a responsible manner and to working with integrity, transparency, respect and the highest ethical standards.”In response to the 2017 allegations, it said pollution and water quality are monitored in line with international standards and a grievance mechanism is open to those affected.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",2022-03-10
 Changes in Atlantic currents may have dire climate implications for the next centuryAndrew Meijers,Without modifying human behaviour we run the risk of violent weather swings and a drastic effect on crops and ocean life,,"The ocean circulation that keeps our relatively northern corner of Europe warm(ish) is often likened to a gigantic conveyor belt bringing warm equatorial water northwards at the surface, balanced by cold southward flow at great depth. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC for short, brings heat energy northward at the equivalent rate of 10 Hiroshima bombs every second and keeps our weather mild, and just a little bit too damp, and is critical to the wider climate.New research has provided important long-term context for scientists’ observations of these Atlantic currents that bring warmth and climatic stability to our shores, with concerning implications for the coming century. Changes in the AMOC in the geologic past have caused significant local and global impacts, and for several decades now oceanographers have been monitoring its strength.Computer modelling and theory predict a steady reduction in the strength of the AMOC and its heat-delivery service in response to human-induced changes in rainfall, river runoff and the melting of Arctic sea ice and the Greenland ice sheet. Additionally, they show that the AMOC is one of the global climate “tipping points”. If reduced beyond a certain, currently uncertain, limit it may collapse suddenly, with huge implications for our lives. Our best observational estimates, based on oceanographic data back to 1871, show that there has already been an approximate 15% reduction in AMOC strength.What is missing, though, is longer-term context: is the present decline part of a long natural cycle, or is it due to human influence?Research published in the journal Nature Geoscience this week has provided this context. Authors from Ireland, Germany and the UK have shown that the AMOC is the weakest it has been at any point in more than 1,000 years. They have done this using a combination of 11 different “proxy measurements” that indirectly infer the AMOC strength. These proxies include marine sediment composition, tree rings, ice-core chemistry and other exotic measurements that make up the bread and butter of the niche-within-a-niche field of paleoceanography.Atlantic Ocean circulation at weakest in a millennium, say scientistsRead moreOn their own, any single such record should be interpreted with caution, but nine of these 11 proxies show a reduction in the AMOC strength since the late 1800s, with an even greater weakening since the 1960s. Importantly, they also show that prior to about 1850, the approximate start of human industrial influence, the AMOC strength was relatively steady right back to before 400 AD.This provides critical observational evidence linking human influence to the decline in the AMOC strength, backing up what climate models have been showing for decades. These same models also predict that under current emission rates the AMOC may be reduced to less than half its original strength by the year 2100. There is still a great deal of uncertainty here, but the message is a robust one: continued greenhouse gas emissions will drive the AMOC lower and lower. Fortunately, the recent Special Report on the Oceans and Cryosphere from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that we were still “very unlikely” to encounter the tipping point in the present century, but this does not mean there aren’t consequences in the nearer term.A reduced AMOC is projected to bring colder weather overall to the UK and northern Europe, with much more intense winters and storms off the Atlantic, as well as reduced summer rainfall and crop productivity and a greater likelihood of extreme weather events such as the 2015 European summer heatwave. The impacts are not limited to this side of the Atlantic either. Increased sea levels are predicted on the US eastern seaboard, with the associated increased risks of flooding and potentially increased hurricane intensities.Such large changes in ocean circulation also put the ecosystems and aquaculture we depend upon at risk. Marine deoxygenation and changes in key species abundances have been linked to an AMOC slowdown, along with an overall reduction in North Atlantic ocean productivity.The far southern end of the AMOC around Antarctica is also of concern. The global ocean as a whole has absorbed more than 90% of human induced warming, absolutely dwarfing the changes in air temperature that we are all so concerned with. The vast ocean ringing Antarctica is where most of this extra heat (and carbon dioxide) has been injected into the deep ocean, and it is warming and acidifying at an alarming rate. One of the main areas of research for oceanographers such as myself is whether the ocean will continue to essentially sweep human impacts under the carpet – and what may happen if that stops.This should not be a cause for despair and inaction though. The same models that predict the AMOC slowdown also show that strong emission reductions now can drive an AMOC recovery towards the end of the century. Research may reduce uncertainties, but the message is clear: strong climate action at governmental and industrial levels is needed now, and it is the job of the people to force such action with their wallets and votes.

"‘I thought I was broken’: when wildland firefighters head home, trauma takes hold","The toll of battling wildfires manifests in higher rates of alcohol abuse, divorce, sleep deprivation and suicidal thoughts","['Gabrielle Canon', ' in Los Angeles', '@GabrielleCanon']","Asad Rahman woke up feeling like someone had punched him in the face. It was the winter after one of his first seasons as a wildland firefighter and he’d battled a blaze that had claimed the lives of six other firefighters. The stress left Rahman grinding his teeth at night until his jaw ached.California firefighters ‘stretched to limit’ as devastating blazes become the normRead moreIt would be years before Rahman could acknowledge the symptoms of strain. He’s not alone.Now that another wildfire season has come and gone, firefighters who spent months in the trenches are returning home. Along with the familial problems caused by their prolonged absence and the financial stresses some will face during a season without work, the off-season can bring simmering mental health struggles to the surface.Downtime away from the rush of firefighting and the camaraderie in the camps can be the perfect opportunity for stress to rear its head, says Rahman, who has spent 36 years in the field and now serves as a battalion chief for the Bureau of Land Management.Firefighters light a backfire to stop the Caldor fire from spreading near South Lake Tahoe, California, in September. Photograph: Jae C Hong/AP“We are in this work-mode and we are adrenaline junkies and it is really hard to come down,” Rahman says. “You’re under so much constant danger all summer that your system is on a constant state of alert. And it’s a crash when you come off of that – an absolute crash.”The cumulative effects of the perilous and prolonged assignments show up in higher rates of alcohol abuse, divorce and sleep deprivation. First responders are also 10 times more likely to contemplate or attempt suicide than the general public and mental health-related deaths now outpace line of duty fatalities. But for years, the toll trauma takes on first responders has been buried behind a culture of stoicism that’s persisted in the profession.If they know that their family’s welfare is dependent on them getting 1,000 hours of overtime, there is no way in hell they are going to take a breakMichelle HartOver the last three decades, Rahman has faced more danger, more fatalities, more fear and the relentless trauma of bearing witness to the devastation wildfires leave in their wake. But “it was always, suck it up and go forward. Just rub some dirt on it and keep going”, he says. It comes at an enormous cost. Six of Rahman’s friends have died by suicide. They are among thousands of first responders who struggled silently under the building pressure as fires become more frequent, more dangerous and more difficult to contain, adding a devastating new dimension to an already taxing line of work.Pressures of being a public ‘hero’After two consecutive record-breaking seasons sandwiching the Covid crisis, Dr Mynda Ohs, a mental health clinician who works with first responders, is concerned that this winter could be one of the worst for mental health. “As soon as we settle down and they can come out of work brain – oh man”, she says. “It’s going to hit.”Ohs has spent years working with wildland firefighters, but she also knows their plight from personal experience. Her husband and son both work in the field. In 2020, her husband was deployed for 61 straight days. “He came home and he was a shell of a man,” she says. It took months before he started acting like himself.Firefighters from the Woodbridge fire department rest in front of a fire truck as the Caldor fire burns near Strawberry, California, in September. Photograph: Fred Greaves/Reuters“The off-season can be very difficult for first responders,” says Jeff Dill, a former fire captain who founded the Firefighter Behavioral Health Alliance, an organization dedicated to helping emergency workers navigate the emerging mental health crises in their field.Dill cites what he refers to as “cultural brainwashing” – the public’s reliance on a hero narrative that diminishes firefighter vulnerability and reinforces the stigma many feel about seeking help – as a key obstacle to creating more openness around the issue.You’re under so much constant danger all summer that your system is on a constant state of alert. And it’s a crash when you come off of that – an absolute crashAsad RahmanThe result has been deadly.Dill tracks the rising suicide toll on firefighters and EMT crew members, a grim tally that previously went uncounted. He validates the numbers himself and coordinates support groups for loved ones grappling with the loss. So far this year, 81 firefighters and EMT workers have been counted. Between 2015 and 2020, his counts included 818 men and women. Dill believes his data only reflects about 65% of the actual number.“We do it to remember them but also to understand the reasons why,” he said, adding that “these are not numbers – these are the faces and names of my brothers and sisters and the families that they left behind.”He’s found that ruptures in family relationships after long assignments is a top trigger. “[Wildland firefighters] are gone for months and when they come back they are strangers.”A hard job that’s only getting worseTony Martinez, a Cal Fire captain who has spent 28 years working for the state agency, said the work has undergone a profound change in recent years. The intensity of the modern fire season, combined with a continuous crunch on resources, has created a cycle that both creates more strain and drives people away from the profession.“I have people telling me they don’t ever want to go on another fire again – and these are guys who are only a third of the way through their career,” he says. “From the things they have seen, close calls, stress of being on duty for weeks and months on end, and worried about if their family will still be there or not – that was never a thing before.”A firefighter surveys a destroyed downtown during the Dixie fire in Greenville, California in August. Photograph: Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty ImagesThat’s also why Martinez, who comes from a family of public servants, says he hopes his two teenage sons will break with tradition. “We have a major mental health issue right now,” he adds. “I only see that as the weeks and months and years go by, that increase – and I don’t think the public has any idea.”A federal wildland firefighter, who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution from his employer said he’s considered ending his career, mostly because of the impact it has on his young family. “You come home, after being gone for two or three weeks and it’s a dumpster fire at your own house,” he said. “Everyone is stressed out, my kids haven’t seen me, I am stressed out, my wife is stressed out because she’s been a single working mom – it just gets to the point where it’s not worth it for me to go on these fires.”Federal firefighters rely on hazard and overtime pay to supplement their small wages and survive through the off-season and that, he said, also incentivizes crews to push past their limits. Colleagues have refused care, declined important surgeries, and denied themselves the rest and recuperation they need.“In the last five-10 years the fires have gotten so much more intense,” he said. “And you couple that with the low pay and the low staffing – now people just can’t afford to do the job. It’s so stressful.” Federal agencies, including the US Forest Service have struggled to retain qualified candidates and with each new empty seat, the strain grows.People who had years and years of trauma are now getting the tools they need to live normal livesAsad RahmanA wakeup call and push for solutionsOfficials are beginning to heed the call. Joe Biden oversaw temporary pay-increases to ensure no firefighter made less than $15 an hour. The $1tn infrastructure bill also includes language to permanently increase salaries, improve job titles, minimize hazards and establish essential mental health programs. Separate legislation, passed as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2022, grants federal firefighters housing stipends and funds programs that provide peer-support, stress management, mental health leave, and mental health professionals with trauma expertise.Advocates still want to expand on these improvements and ensure that the changes will stick. Another bill – named Tim’s Act for Tim Hart, a smokejumper who died fighting a blaze in New Mexico this year – aims to go further. The act, introduced in October, includes provisions to guarantee mental health leave, create career transition funds and expand stress management programs that have been successful at helping first responders cope.For Hart’s wife, Michelle, the issues tackled by the bill are extremely personal. She witnessed Tim push himself through pain and fatigue to do one of the most dangerous jobs – parachuting into fires too difficult to reach from the ground – in order to earn enough overtime and hazard pay to get through the off-season.“You can tell them until you are blue in the face that they have to take classes about mental health and recognize depression and suicidal tendencies in their friends and co-workers and utilize the programs – but if they know that their family’s welfare is dependent on them getting 1,000 hours of overtime, there is no way in hell they are going to take a break,” said Michelle.Firefighters pose next to the General Sherman tree in Sequoia national forest after wrapping it in fire-resistant material. Photograph: National Park Service HANDOUT/EPAThat’s why this year was supposed to be Tim’s final year as a firefighter. He and Michelle were going to start a family, but that dream ended on 2 June. Michelle got the call she had always dreaded and rushed to be by her husband’s side as he was airlifted to a hospital. Tim didn’t look like himself. His face was swollen. His leg was badly broken. Staples tracked across his head.“The way I recognized it was him was his feet were out,” Michelle said through sobs. “It was the only part of his body that still looked like him, that wasn’t broken and swollen. His perfectly pale, baby-soft feet, because they were always in socks.”Tim spent nine days in the hospital before he was taken off life support. Michelle was there with him, holding his hand and stroking his head.“It’s important for people to understand how hard this is – and that it’s not just me,” says Michelle, who has since committed to preserving her husband’s legacy by pushing for systemic change. “This is happening to the people who are putting their lives on the line for their country.”Asad Rahman, the battalion chief, is also heartened that, along with the legislative changes, the stigma is starting to shift. While he’s continued to fight fires, for the last 15 years he’s been part of a peer support network designed to foster the trust needed to help firefighters heal. He now serves as a lead.It was a turn of the tide to have that support and to know that your feelings – the anger, the rage, the frustration, the hurt, depression – all of that was a normal response to what you encounteredAsad RahmanHe likened the agencies to a big ship, one that’s difficult to turn, but expressed hope that the culture is changing. The US Forest Service, which employs more than 10,000 firefighters, has brought on clinicians trained in trauma counseling. The Bureau of Land Management, the agency Rahman works for, has initiated pre-season discussions with its wildland firefighters in order to encourage a culture of openness.“People who had years and years of trauma are now getting the tools they need to live normal lives,” he says. Mindfulness, meditation and connections to clinicians who specialize in working with firefighters have been game-changers, Rahman says, adding that he’s hopeful everyone – from rookies to retirees – will receive better trauma training. Rahman has benefited from the shift himself. Five years ago he was diagnosed with PTSD – 31 years after he’d started his career. Now, as he prepares to retire in the new year, he credits the culture-change with saving his life and is excited about his future away from fire.“I get emotional thinking about it because it was a turn of the tide to have that support and to know that your feelings – the anger, the rage, the frustration, the hurt, depression – all of that was a normal response to what you encountered,” he says. “I didn’t know it was normal. I thought I was broken.”

 Blossom falls: 80% of small orchards in England and Wales lost since 1900,"Traditional orchards, havens for wildlife, have been lost to housing and farmland, National Trust reports",['Steven Morris'],"A century ago, small orchards were the glory not only of the countryside but of towns and cities across the UK, buzzing with life during the summer and, at this time of year, rich with the sight and scent of blossom.But research released as this spring’s blossom sweeps across the UK has found there are 80% fewer small “traditional” orchards, which are regarded as particularly important for flora and fauna, in England and Wales compared with in 1900.Even taking into account large commercial concerns, which are not as ecologically rich, the two countries have lost more than half of all orchard space since then.According to a report from the National Trust, the south-west of England is one of the regions hardest hit, with the area of orchards that have vanished equating to almost twice the size of the city of Bristol.There have been dramatic losses in the north of England, where declines of about 80% have been found. As cities and towns have expanded, they have lost most of their orchards, with London having only 3% left and Cheltenham in Gloucestershire 1%.In urban areas, orchards have mostly been lost to housing and other types of development, while in the countryside they have been uprooted to create more farmland, the report says.Kent is the English county that has the highest total coverage today but this is because of the number of large commercial orchards rather than the speckling of traditional, more nature-filled ones. The decline along the English and Welsh border has been less steep than in other regions.Reduction in areas covered by orchards in England and WalesTom Dommett, the head of historic environment at the National Trust, said that for centuries orchards were a defining feature of neighbourhoods, part of the fabric of everyday life. He said: “Their loss affects local culture, how we all experience landscapes, and it means fewer opportunities for people to enjoy the beauty and spectacle of blossom.”Traditional orchards are defined as sites with at least five trees managed in a low-intensity way, the floor grazed or mowed with little or no chemical input.Dommett continued: “The loss of traditional orchards is also nature’s loss; these orchards can be great places for wildlife like flies and bees, with the gnarled trunks and branches creating the perfect home for rare species.”The first Covid lockdown two years ago prompted the conservation charity to launch its first “blossom watch” campaign, encouraging people to look out for and share images of blossom.It is stepping up its drive this year, trying to inspire a British version of the Japanese blossom celebration, hanami.But it has also undertaken in-depth research to find out how many orchards are left. The trust used a firm specialising in artificial intelligence to compare orchards in England and Wales marked on Ordnance Survey maps from the turn of the 20th century with modern OS maps, data from People’s Trust for Endangered Species and Natural England.The National Trust has committed to planting 4m blossom trees in England, Wales and Northern Ireland by 2030 and to set up more traditional orchards on its land.John Deakin, the head of trees and woodland at the trust, said: “Traditional orchards and the blossom they bring creates valuable early nectar sources for insects which are often foraging for scarce resources in the early spring.“These native, historic varieties, together with other trees like blackthorn and hawthorn which also have amazing spring blossom, mature at a faster rate than other larger native species such as oak. They provide an important bridge for insects that rely on their particular ecosystems which is one of the reasons why planting more blossom trees is such a vital part of our ambitions.”One of the projects being launched this year is a scheme to bring more orchard trees into Birmingham, once known as a city “ringed with blossom”. In Birmingham in 1900 there were 186 hectares (460 acres) of orchards, compared with 29 today.As part of the Birmingham 2022 festival, a six-month celebration of creativity around the 2022 Commonwealth Games, the trust is creating two pop-up blossom gardens in the city centre and is to recreate a symbolic ring of new trees around Birmingham planted on the 27-mile No 11 outer circle bus route.",2022-03-24
 Campaign launched to protect 80% of Amazon at key environment summit,"‘New alliance with equal rights’ needed, say indigenous delegates at IUCN biodiversity conference","['The age of extinction is supported by', 'About this content', 'Phoebe Weston', '@phoeb0']","Indigenous voices on the environment are finally being heard as Marseille hosts a global biodiversity summit, with a call to protect 80% of the Amazon, as well as a “counter conference” highlighting the conservation movement’s historic violation of people’s rights.For the first time in its seven-decade history, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is including indigenous peoples as full voting members in their own right, rather than under the NGO category. Dozens of indigenous meetings are happening at the summit – which occurs every four years – with representatives from 23 organisations.Greater inclusion of indigenous representatives comes as the European “fortress conservation” model, which resulted in vast human rights abuses and an estimated 20 million people displaced from their homelands worldwide since the 19th century, is increasingly being challenged.Historically, the global conservation movement was based on the idea that protected areas flourish free from human disturbance, but a growing body of evidence shows that indigenous communities are the best at looking after wildlife, and that as much as 80% of the world’s remaining forest biodiversity lies within indigenous peoples’ territories.‘We seek to build a new alliance with equal rights on equal terms,’ José Gregorio Díaz Mirabal told the IUCN congress in Marseille. Photograph: Arnold Jerocki/GettyJosé Gregorio Díaz Mirabal, a member of Venezuela’s Wakuenai Kurripaco people and coordinator of the Congress of Indigenous Organisations of the Amazon River Basin (Coica), which represents more than 2 million indigenous people, said they had been fighting for decades to be heard.“We come to the IUCN with our voice and voting rights. We seek to build a new alliance with equal rights on equal terms, but we see that there is still much to do, so much to recognise,” he said.“Less than 1% of all the funding that is invested in protecting intact biodiversity and mitigating climate change in our territories reaches our communities, and that has to change. It’s absurd that so much of the funding goes to consultants who are sent to tell us what we already know about how to conserve what we are already conserving.”Representatives from countries across the world will vote on motions this week that will shape future global conservation policy and the allocation of finance. Coica’s Amazonia por la vida (Amazonia for Life) campaign motion is demanding protection of 80% of the Amazon basin by 2025 (protected areas and indigenous territories make up about 45% currently) with the emphasis on indigenous peoples managing those protected areas. They are asking governments to recognise 100% of indigenous land in the Amazon and ban all forms of extractive industries in those areas.A record number of environmental defenders were killed in 2019 for protecting their land, 40% of whom were from indigenous communities. “Science is saying the best-conserved areas are indigenous territories … yet we have the highest level of murder,” Díaz Mirabal said.“National parks receive funding and support from governments but when it comes to our indigenous territories we’re left to spill our own blood to defend it. Now it is time for our indigenous territories to be protected with the same level of support and legislation,” he said.As well as showcasing a range of ideas from campaigners, scientists and conservationists, the summit provides policymakers with a chance to discuss issues in the run-up to the Cop15 “Paris agreement for nature”, due to be negotiated in Kunming next year. The headline target is likely to be protecting 30% of the planet for nature by the end of the decade (the “30x30” target).Nadino Calapucha, Claudette Labonté, Carmen Josse and José Gregorio Díaz Mirabal at the Amazonia for Life: 80% by 2025 press conference. Photograph: Arnold Jerocki/GettyThe draft Cop15 agreement includes a clause that traditional knowledge of indigenous peoples and local communities should guide decision-making “with their free, prior, and informed consent”. But indigenous groups, academics and campaigners from 18 countries gathered in Marseille at the “Our Land, Our Nature” congress, a “counter-summit” on the eve of the IUCN meeting, called for land rights to be at the heart of conservation, not protected areas. More than 3,000 people attended the event, either in person or online, which included a protest march through the French city.“The 30x30 target is a structural problem,” said Mordecai Ogada, director of Conservation Solutions Afrika. “We need to rethink the definition of protected areas, those that exist, and we need to look for a more sophisticated model of biodiversity and conservation. That’s where the big organisations have such a challenge, because they find it very difficult to change their own structures.”‘We need to rethink the definition of protected areas,’ according to Mordecai Ogada. Photograph: Noé GabrielThe alternative summit included representatives from Survival International, Rainforest Foundation UK and the Minority Rights Group, as well as a number of indigenous people with different perspectives on the usefulness of protected areas.Juan Pablo Gutiérrez, a representative of the Yukpa people in Colombia but living in exile in France, said areas that governments were designating as “protected” had been safeguarded for years by indigenous people.“What’s happening with 30x30 is that governments want to distract global opinion by proposing solutions that don’t relate to the real problem at all. If you want to attack climate change, you need to attack the causes that are leading to it,” he said, citing western consumption and overexploitation of resources as the key drivers of ecological destruction.A UN report published earlier this year found indigenous people in South America were the best at looking after forests, with deforestation 50% lower than elsewhere, according to a review of more than 300 studies. Representatives at the Our Land, Our Nature gathering argued that there was little scientific evidence that protecting 30% of the planet would stem biodiversity loss. The previous 10-year UN target agreed in 2010 in Aichi, Japan, set goals that by 2020, 17% of terrestrial areas and 10% of coastal and marine areas would be conserved.Lara Dominguez, a lawyer with the Minority Rights Group, said: “Despite being very close to achieving the 17% target in many states, biodiversity loss has reached unprecedented levels. Even though we have more protected areas, it hasn’t actually impacted biodiversity in a positive way.”Dominguez believes these policies are driven more by politics than science and argues that a rights-based approach to conservation would be far more effective.Campaigners for indigenous peoples’ rights carry a banner in Marseille reading: ‘Change the system, not the climate.’ Photograph: Christophe Simon/AFP/GettyFrancisco Ramiro Batzín Chojoj, legal representative of the Guatemala-based indigenous organisation Sotz’il, said it was important that indigenous people had a seat at the table and that working towards the 30x30 target was “fundamental”.“We are calling for indigenous people to be respected in all these initiatives because it’s essential they are involved.”Knowledge of medicinal plants at risk as languages die outRead moreStewart Maginnis, global director of the IUCN’s nature-based solutions group, said: “The 30x30 can and must work to support indigenous peoples by strengthening their custodianship, voice and rights.“Protection for nature conservation need not and should not exclude people,” he said. “Many of the world’s protected and conserved areas are managed in a way where people and communities live and work within their boundaries.”A UN policy brief on human rights and the environment, released last month, emphasised the need for a dramatic departure from “conservation as usual”. Neville Ash, director of the UN Environment Programme conservation monitoring centre, said indigenous people and communities who governed large areas of land were often not recognised for their extensive contributions to nature conservation. “This needs to change,” he said.“The draft framework is explicit on the importance of employing rights-based approaches for its implementation, and governments and other actors will need to learn from mistakes of the past and be held accountable for delivering on these future commitments in line with human rights obligations.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",2022-10-19
Secrets of the cat walk: why some pet owners are taking their feline friends out on a leash,"Pet cats are a major threat to native wildlife so councils in Australia are cracking down – but some kitties can still enjoy an outdoor stroll, as long as they’re leashed

",['Tory Shepherd'],"Some cats, apparently, don’t like being walked on a leash.But some do, and according to an animal behaviour expert, some cats can be trained to walk on a lead, ensuring they can still enjoy the outdoors.More council areas are banning cats from roaming around off-leash and threatening native wildlife, so they are being herded inside.A study has found pet cats kill about 230 million native Australian animals a year. Add in feral cats, and the total is about 1.7 billion native animals. Research suggests cats, wild and domesticated, are responsible for dozens of extinctions, and threaten another 120 species.Owners in many areas of Australia are being told to keep cats indoors, with some councils implementing curfews and even bans on letting cats out.Australia weekendFrom July, all Canberran cats will have to be kept indoors. Greater Bendigo already does that, and the Adelaide Hills brought in similar rules at the start of the year.In many cases, though, cats are allowed day release – if they’re kept on a leash.The RSPCA says that, unlike dogs, cats are in charge on a walk: The humans are expected to follow them. (As author Terry Pratchett said: “In ancient times cats were worshipped as gods; they have not forgotten this.”)Dr Jacqui Ley, a Melbourne specialist in veterinary behavioural medicine, works with animals with mental health problems “to help them become well again”. She says you can teach a tethered cat to walk.“Some cats like going out for a walk on the lead,” she says. “They’re just like people. Some are much more sociable, outgoing, and some … like to stay home.Dr Jacqui Ley says training a cat to walk on a leash will probably not be a fast process. Photograph: Ellen Smith/The Guardian“The trick is for the human carers, guardians and owners to figure out what sort of cat theirs is and whether or not they’re going to like it.”She concedes training a cat to walk on a lead may not be a fast process. First, find a cat harness – they’re available online, and at a range of pet stores – and it must be a harness. A cat collar won’t cut it. Then let your moggy pad about the house with it on, while it gets used to it. Treats will help.Then attach a lead to the harness, and move around the house (without pulling on it – kitten gloves, people).When you think your cat is comfy, try a stroll in the yard first, before heading into the big, wide world and bracing for the occasionally catty glance.Vet nurse Nina Gibbins is teaching her two-year-old Burmese cat Summer to walk on a lead. Photograph: Ellen Smith/The GuardianThe RSPCA’s policy is that “a leash and harness may be used to walk cats outside the owner’s property under direct supervision”, but goes on to say: “Despite some owners successfully training their cat to walk on a leash, in general the RSPCA does not recommend it”.New environments can stress a cat, the association says, and an escape-proof enclosure might be a better option. It also warns against taking cats to public parks, but doesn’t specifically mention alleys, litter, or tin roofs.Vet nurse Nina Gibbins has been diligently trying to teach her two-year-old Burmese cat Summer to walk on a lead. Summer seems deeply contemptuous of the idea that she should obey Gibbins’ directions, but relatively happy to be on a lead.So to save native wildlife, and to avoid having a fat cat, it might be worth teaching the old mog new tricks.",2022-04-19
 Methuselah arrived in the US in 1938. She’s now the oldest fish in captivity,"The lungfish arrived in San Francisco on a steamship along with 230 other fish. Today, she’s the only living aquatic animal from that vessel",['Katharine Gammon'],"She’s super-gentle, and doesn’t get overly excited. She enjoys eating earthworms, fruits and vegetables, and slowly moving around her tank. Her favorite food – at least for what is in season now – is a fig.California dreamin’: scenes of Black joy and leisure in the Jim Crow era – in picturesRead moreIf Methuselah sounds like a grand old dame, it’s because she is: she is the oldest living fish in captivity, aged somewhere upwards of 92 and potentially as high as 101 years. She arrived on a steamship from Australia along with 230 other fish to the Steinhart aquarium in San Francisco in 1938 as a young, small fish. And Methuselah’s story unfolded in a typical way, for a fish in an aquarium: she grew. Humans came to look at her. She peered back through glass at humans.But 1938 was a different time: bread cost nine cents a loaf. A racehorse named Seabiscuit was winning races. Germany was persecuting Jews, foretelling a coming conflict in Europe.Then there is Methuselah, who is no ordinary fish. She’s the only fish still living from the steamship. And most important, she’s a lungfish – a species more closely related to humans or cows than to ray-finned fish like salmon or cod – which can breathe air using a single lung when streams become stagnant, or when water quality changes. Lungfish are also believed to be an example of the original creatures that crawled out of water and moved to land in evolutionary history. The species was discovered in 1870 – and the scientist who first described the fish originally thought it was an amphibian.Lungfish like Methuselah have long-held secrets, but scientists have only recently attempted to understand their evolution and life history. For one thing, the fish’s genome is the largest of any animal, containing 43bn base pairs – roughly 14 times the number in the human genome. The previous record holder, the Mexican axolotl, has a genome made up of 32bn base pairs.“Genetics is really quite straightforward for normal fish – but for lungfish they’re so unique and so different that all of those techniques didn’t or don’t work,” said David T Roberts, a senior scientist with Seqwater, the statutory authority of the government of Queensland in Australia, where the fish still live in a handful of rivers in the wild. “It’s always pushed the envelope on uncovering some of its secrets to be able to manage and conserve it – and age is a really important one.”Methuselah lives at the Steinhart aquarium at the California Academy of Sciences in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, California. Photograph: John G Mabanglo/EPAA fish’s age is critical to know because it tells scientists information like growth rates, maturity, longevity and how long they breed – which is vital fundamental knowledge to manage a protected species.Lungfish – a vulnerable species – have proved especially challenging to date because they grow a lot at the beginning of their lives, but then grow extremely slowly (yet continuously) for the remainder of their lives. Ear bones that are harvested after most fish’s death can be counted like tree rings, but lungfish, always the outlier, don’t have the same composition to their ear bones.So scientists started to use radiocarbon to date the fish – relying on a technique that basically imprints living things with a carbon signature resulting from the atomic bomb tests back in the 1950s. But that doesn’t work well in animals born before 1950, when the carbon signature changed.Now, scientists are using DNA tools that look at methylation – the way that DNA is turned on or off – to date the fish. For younger fish, it can offer an exact number, but for older fish it gives a range of dates.It wasn’t the first time this technique had been used. Last year, scientists estimated a lungfish named Granddad that lived at the Shedd aquarium in Chicago to be 109 years old (give or take six years) at the time of its death, confirming that lungfish can live well over 100 years. The analysis also revealed that Granddad started its life in the Burnett River in Queensland, Australia, the location of the species’ original discovery in 1870.In the study on Methuselah, aquarium workers took samples the size of a peppercorn from the lungfish in captivity and extracted the DNA from that in order to estimate their age for the first time ever. They found Methuselah to be at least 92 years old. The scientists plan to release their findings of 30 other lungfish later this year, as part of a library of living lungfish across the world.Knowing how long they potentially live and understanding more about how long they could reproduce could drive how we’re caring for habitat to help keep that species afloat in the wildBrenda Melton“Knowing how long they potentially live and understanding more about how long they could reproduce could drive how we’re caring for habitat to help keep that species afloat in the wild,” says Brenda Melton, director of animal care and welfare at the Steinhart aquarium. “It just really opens the doors for a lot of other conversations and questions that might be able to be asked about how we can better care for them in the wild and preserve habitat.”Roberts is inspired to continue to conserve the fish – after all, lungfish were around before dinosaurs became extinct, and their cousins possibly split off into animals with legs and then crawled on to land and then became humans, he says. “They’re a cousin to all land animals, basically.”Methuselah’s age is now known, but she still holds other mysteries – even her biological sex. The handlers use she/her pronouns, but they actually don’t know if Methuselah is a male or female. Some fish have gender differences in size or shape – but not lungfish. And behaviorally, they suspect she’s a female, but they will not be able to find out for sure until after she dies.Another question is if the fish is feeling old – and how do fish change when they’re geriatric? Melton says it varies widely. Most fish live only a few years – so it’s rare to see really old fish in the wild. But there are some hints: some spinal changes, like a curved back, or weight loss, cloudy eyes or looking a little gray in the scales.Two of the other fish in the new study were estimated to be 50 and 54 years old – and Melton says they look a little more similar in coloration, while Methuselah has gotten a little lighter in color over the years. “We don’t know that that’s actually tied to her age, but it’s the only thing that we have seen physically that looks different for this fish.”Melton says that just the existence of something that has lived for so long leaves her in awe. She wonders what Methuselah thinks of all her companions and living situations over the many years she’s spent at the aquarium – as the fish has the longest institutional memory of anything in the building.“It’s incredible to me that after all of these years of having her in our care,” she says, “we’re still learning and we still have the ability to learn from animals in ways that we can’t even conceive yet.”",2023-09-24
"Octopuses and lobsters have feelings – include them in sentience bill, urge MPs",Group argues some invertebrates are extremely intelligent and should be protected from suffering,['Helena Horton'],"Octopuses and lobsters have feelings and should be included in the animal sentience bill, a group of Conservative MPs has said.The influential Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation (CAWF), which counts Carrie Johnson and the environment minister Lord Goldsmith as patrons, has been meeting with the government to ask them to recognise the sentience of invertebrates.The bill, now at second reading stage in the House of Lords, recognises that fish and other vertebrates feel pain and should be protected, where possible, from suffering. However, the group of MPs has argued that some invertebrates are extremely intelligent and should be included in the bill.A new report by the CAWF has found that the UK fishing fleet lands more than 420 million cephalopods and crustaceans each year. This is a total of 73,600 tonnes of crustaceans and 12,100 tonnes of cephalopods.The report, backed by MPs including Sir David Amess and Sir Roger Gale, argues that these animals are discriminated against in legislation because their “neurological architecture differs from our own”.It concludes: “Common arguments against crustacean and cephalopod sentience focus on distinctions between these animals’ anatomy and human anatomy (such as that they process information outside the brain, eg in ganglions). However, this anthropocentric view fails to capture what it means for an animal to be sentient.“Crustaceans and cephalopods undoubtably experience the world in extremely different ways to ourselves. What matters, though, is whether that experience entails conscious experience of pleasure and pain. We believe that the evidence is sufficient to show that these animals do experience pleasure and pain.”It cites scientific studies showing that the animals know to avoid predators, and that some of the more intelligent invertebrates can weigh up options and make trade-offs between pain and predator avoidance, between pain and undesirable environments, and between pain and feeding.It is well known that octopuses are intelligent, and they have been found to be excellent at solving puzzles. The Netflix film My Octopus Teacher, released last year, brought the issue to a large audience, as hundreds of thousands of people were charmed by the relationship between human and inquisitive octopus.Lorraine Platt, founder of CAWF, said: “All but a very small minority of scientists agree these are sentient animals capable of pain and suffering. It’s very important they are kept in the animal sentience bill. My Octopus Teacher is a very moving film about a female octopus, about how clever she is, how she can avoid predators, sharks, on a daily basis. If I feel this way I am sure many others feel the same way.“Why are they excluded? I am sure there are concerns from industry because it throws light on how these animals are killed, stored, transported. This quantifies why they should be included in the bill. We are talking about millions of animals here. They are afforded protections in Norway, Sweden and Austria but not here.”The new animal sentience legislation will mean that any new government policy will have to take into account that vertebrate animals can experience feelings including pain or joy. This will be decided by a committee made up of animal experts from within the field.A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “We’re proud to have some of the highest animal welfare standards in the world, and we are fully committed to strengthening them further to ensure all animals avoid any unnecessary pain, distress or suffering.“We have already commissioned an independent external review of the available scientific evidence on sentience in the class Cephalopoda, which includes octopus, cuttlefish and squid – and we will carefully consider the results of this review.”",2018-06-13
" Fish feed additive banned in EU found in Tasmanian salmon at concerning levels, researchers say","Experts call for tighter regulations as tests find ethoxyquin exceeds maximum limits in Tassal and Petuna salmon

","['Donna Lu', '@donnadlu']","A fish feed additive banned in the European Union out of concerns for health impacts in animals and humans has been found in Tasmanian salmon at concerning levels, say experts who are calling for tighter regulations.Dr Christian Narkowicz, an organic chemist, last year commissioned the National Measurement Institute to test salmon for residues of ethoxyquin.The compound, a synthetic antioxidant, was developed by Monsanto in the 1950s. It has been used to prevent fish meal from spontaneously combusting while being transported at sea.The national regulator, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, has set a maximum residue limit for ethoxyquin of 1mg per kilogram of salmon.Tasmania’s ‘reset’ plan for salmon industry criticised as ‘greenwashing’Read moreThe testing commissioned by Narkowicz found that ethoxyquin levels in three brands of Tasmanian salmon were within the maximum residue limits. However, it found that in Tassal and Petuna salmon there were significant levels of ethoxyquin dimer – two ethoxyquin molecules joined together – which forms as the additive undergoes chemical changes.In the Tassal sample, the ethoxyquin level was 0.34mg/kg and the dimer level was 1.2mg/kg, resulting in a combined rate of 1.54mg/kg. In the Petuna sample, there was 0.11mg/kg of ethoxyquin and 0.91mg/kg of dimer, giving a sum of 1.02mg/kg.Researchers say the maximum residue limits should also take into account levels of the ethoxyquin dimer.

“The dimer accumulates at higher levels than ethoxyquin,” Narkowicz said.“Ethoxyquin has a half-life of around a week, but the dimer has a half-life of around 10 weeks. What happens over time [is that] most of the ethoxyquin gets converted to the dimer.”The dimer is considered to have the same toxic potential as ethoxyquin itself, said Stuart McLean, emeritus professor at the University of Tasmania.“Ethoxyquin is a parent which produces many other products – a couple of dozen,” McLean said.“These products are formed in the fish feed itself, and also in the fish, and also in humans who eat the fish. Essentially, these other products have been ignored in the safety limit. They only look at ethoxyquin.”The European Commission suspended the use of ethoxyquin as an animal feed additive in 2017, as “experts could not conclude on the safety of the additive”.European regulators also expressed concerns about the presence of a compound called p-phenetidine, from which ethoxyquin is made, which can persist as an impurity in the product.“P-phenetidine can make up up to 3% of the ethoxyquin,” Narkowicz said. “There are serious concerns around its potential carcinogenicity. There’s not been enough science to look at what happens to it in the fish or the environment.”Narkowicz noted that the testing showed higher levels in Australian fish than were found in European studies before the EU ban.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The implications of this go far beyond basic life skills; it stops local people connecting with their local habitat, which needs their protection, and blocks women from accessing work in the two main industries: fishing and tourism.Research from 2012 suggested that only 10% of 15- and 16-year-olds living in the Maldives could swim. Women and girls are most affected; girls are three times more likely to feel unconfident swimming in the sea than boys, and 50% more likely to have never snorkelled, according to research among school students by the Ocean Women project.A snorkelling lesson on Dharavandhoo.

That would be when the kids would go down and all swim together, but now they don’t cook in that way so much,” she says.Aminath Zoona and Flossy Barraud from the Ocean Women programme.  Photograph: Manta TrustOther social trends contribute to a general lack of swimming skills among Maldivians. Today both parents often work, leaving them with less time to spend in the water with their children, says Aminath Zoona, the founder of Salted Ventures Swimmers, a swimming school in Malé. “Because most parents are too busy to be actively involved in teaching them [children] to swim, they choose not to send them and keep them home.”There are a number of social and cultural reasons why girls are deterred from swimming. “It’s mostly overprotection,” says Zoona, who is also the co-leader of the Ocean Women programme.But social stereotypes are also a factor. On some islands, girls who swim are considered tomboys, “and that’s not seen as a positive thing”, says Barraud. “It’s tying back to that belief – that’s stronger in some places than others – that girls should be home more, not outside hanging around like boys do.”If you don’t know the ocean … the foundation of your existence in the Maldives – why would you want to protect it?Sabra Ibrahim Noordeen, President’s OfficeSome families may also “tell their daughters not to go in the sea because they’ll be in the sun and their skin will get darker”, Barraud says.On island nations, being able to swim is a life skill. In 2019, there were 3.2 drowning deaths per 100,000 people in the Maldives.The lack of swimming skills also cuts off women from employment opportunities in a country where fishing and tourism are top employers. “People here think it [swimming] is more of a manly thing,” says Abdul Azeez. “If you look into swimming, things like snorkelling, diving … you see very few women in the industry.” Instead, women tend to work in the informal sector.There are also consequences for conservation work. A lot of marine conservation organisations struggle to find Maldivian staff, Barraud says, yet local people should be at the forefront of protecting biodiversity.Only 10% of 15- to 16-year-olds in the Maldives can swim. Photograph: Flossy Barraud/Manta Trust“If you don’t know what’s in the ocean, if you don’t know what’s actually forming the foundation of your entire existence in the Maldives, why would you want to protect it?” says Sabra Ibrahim Noordeen, the special envoy for climate change at the President’s Office of the Maldives.Attitudes are changing, says Noordeen, and people are starting to see that women don’t have to be limited to caregiving roles. Today’s parents are increasingly sending their children to swimming lessons, says Abdul Azeez, although Zoona notes that some parents still need to be taught the benefits of learning to swim.More organisations are beginning to focus on swimming skills, too. The Women’s Development Committee on Fonadhoo sponsors local women to take swimming instructor courses, as part of a wider programme to boost female economic empowerment. The Moodhu Bulhaa Dive Centre on Villingili Island is run by the country’s first female Padi-certified course director and emphasises training and hiring women.In October an Ocean Women pilot project will offer swimming instructor training for 10 people from five islands, half of whom must be female. The hope is that they will then teach others in their local community to swim.Lost for words: fears of ‘catastrophic’ language loss due to rising seasRead moreStudents swimming with manta rays in Hanifaru Bay. Photograph: Kaitlyn Zerr /Manta Trust“Some of those people, obviously not all of them, will want to pursue an environmental career, whether that’s marine conservation or another field, or they’ll go into diving or tour guiding,” says Barraud.Abdul Azeez is also hopeful about women breaking into swimming: “I feel like people should be more open-minded and not be so judgmental about the women in this industry. It’s not something only for men; both genders could equally enjoy it.”",2023-04-14
Back to the stone age: the sustainable building material we’ve all been waiting for…,"It’s strong, plentiful and fireproof, as well as beautiful, yet stone has long been supplanted in the building industry by energy-consuming steel, concrete and brick. A trio of advocates for this age-old material say it’s time for a rethink",['Rowan Moore'],"Imagine a building material that is beautiful, strong, plentiful, durable and fireproof, whose use requires low levels of energy and low emissions of greenhouse gases. It is one of the most ancient known to humanity, the stuff of dolmens and temples and cathedrals and Cotswolds cottages, but also one whose sustainability makes it well-suited to the future. Such a material, according to a growing body of opinion in the world of construction, is among us. It’s called stone.Last week I sat in the roof garden of a hefty pile of masonry in central London, talking to three advocates of this magnificent substance: engineer Steve Webb, Pierre Bidaud of the Rutland-based Stonemasonry Company and architect Amin Taha. My initial request, driven by a journalistic preference for highlighting individuals, had been to meet Taha alone, but he pointed out that their work is a collaboration of different disciplines. The building on top of which we met is their joint creation: the six-storey, five-year-old Clerkenwell block where Taha has his office and his home.Their point is that stone has been supplanted in the industrial era by steel, concrete and mass-produced bricks, and is used (if at all) mostly as a thin cosmetic facing, while the hard work of holding up a building is done by the upstart alternatives. They argue that solid stone can once again form the walls and structure of building, with benefits for the environment and for the beauty of architecture. Any form of the material – limestone, sandstone, basalt, granite – can, depending on its properties, be used.The load-bearing raw limestone facade of 15 Clerkenwell Close, home to eight flats and Amin Taha’s practice, Groupwork. Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty ImagesWebb explains how the strength of stone compares well with steel and concrete, yet its environmental impact is far lower. The latter require several different energy-consuming activities, including extraction, smelting, transport, processing and installation. Stone only needs to be cut out from a quarry, taken to a site and put in place. Where the many ingredients of steel and concrete require multiple holes to be dug in the ground, not to mention such things as blast furnaces and rolling mills, the stonework for a given project only needs one.It’s conceivable that the era of concrete will prove only an interlude in the far longer history of stoneThe planet, as Taha points out, is made mostly of stone. “We are sitting on the cold dry skin of boiling magma,” as he puts it, so we are in no danger of running out. For the same reason, stone should almost always be locally available, which keeps the environmental costs of transport down. The material is long-lasting and recyclable. “Any stone building is a quarry,” says Bidaud. “It can be dismantled.”At the same time, 21st-century engineering allows stone to be used more effectively than ever before. The material is naturally strong in compression – that is, when loads are pushed down on it – which means it is good for walls, columns and arches, but less so if it is stretched or bent, as in beams or floor slabs. It is now possible to combine stone with a (sparing) use of steel such that it can perform like reinforced concrete.Webb, Bidaud and Taha are putting their ideas into practice, together and with others. Next year, a 10-storey residential tower is due for completion on Finchley Road in north London (by Taha’s practice Groupwork and Webb’s firm Webb Yates Engineers), whose load-bearing stone structure will make it one of the most remarkable buildings in modern Britain. The three are collaborating on a grand new private house whose masonry vaults look almost medieval in their craftsmanship.A CGI of the ‘remarkable’ forthcoming Finchley Road residential tower, north London, being built by Claire Piffaut, Luc Tamborero and Nicolas Dubois of Ateliers Romeo, Steve Webb of Webb Yates and Amin Taha of Groupwork. Photograph: GroupworkThey also cite works by others, such as an eight-storey, all-stone social housing building in Geneva by local architects Atelier Archiplein, and the Salvador Espriu project on the edge of Palma, Mallorca, whose graceful stone ceilings bely the fact that these are affordable homes built by a government housing institute called Ibavi.These are important examples, as the greatest obstacle to the widespread use of stone is its perceived and actual expense. It’s seen as a luxury item, something for the homes of the one-per-centers. Its use in other countries on relatively low-cost projects shows that it can also be a material for everyday purposes.Webb, Bidaud and Taha argue that stone doesn’t have to be costly. Taha, for example, has demonstrated that you can cut stone into bricks at the same cost or cheaper than the more usual fired-clay kind, with less than one fortieth of the carbon emissions, which has led to 10 quarries offering them as a commercial product. The problem is rather “forces of habit in the building industry”, where “big beast contractors” have invested in concrete and steel and rely on familiar suppliers of these materials. It “takes time for the whole industry to swivel”, they say.Meanwhile, architects, contractors and engineers persist in the old ways. Two billion bricks of the traditional, energy-hungry, carbon-intensive kind are bought in this country every year. Steel and concrete remain the standard options for a wide range of building tasks. Webb is scathing about professional inertia on the subject, about architects “who protest about climate emergency, cycle to work and eat locally grown tomatoes” but don’t examine their own decisions about construction techniques.‘Almost medieval in its craftsmanship’: the subterranean vault of a private house being built by Claire Piffaut, Luc Tamborero and Nicolas Dubois of Ateliers Romeo, Steve Webb of Webb Yates and Amin Taha of Groupwork.  Photograph: Tim SoarYou can get a glimpse of the highly appealing alternatives in a display at the Design Museum in London, How to Build a Low-Carbon Home, where the work of Taha, Webb and Bidaud is on show (until March 2024) alongside structures in wood and straw. Here, and in the other projects they design and celebrate, they offer a compelling vision of a constructional world that is delightful as well as sustainable.Who could look at the solid stone structure of, for example, the Mallorcan social housing, where the forces of nature and the work of humans is evident in the fabric, and prefer the processed surfaces and plasticised finishes of their British equivalents? And the great thing about stone is that, having been used for millennia, it’s well tested. It’s conceivable, indeed, that the era of concrete will prove only an interlude in the far longer history of stone. Such a shift won’t happen easily, but it’s an outcome worth striving for.",2023-08-07
Fork in the road: can Tasmania unwind the environmental damage at Lake Pedder?,"Christine Milne argues the glory of restored Tasmanian lake, drowned in 1972, would outweigh benefits of energy it generates

","['Adam Morton', ' Climate and environment editor']","Few moments in the history of Australian environmentalism echo as loudly as the flooding of Lake Pedder.A glacial outwash lake in Tasmania’s south-west that was celebrated for its pink quartzite beach, Pedder was drowned in 1972 during the construction of dams for the Gordon hydroelectric power scheme. About 230 sq km of forest and wildlife were submerged with it.A campaign to save the lake failed, but it is now regarded as a galvanising moment that led to the creation of the world’s first green political party and the successful drive to stop the damming of the Franklin River a decade later.For decades, there has been a movement to restore the lake to its pre-impoundment health. The Lake Pedder Restoration committee, led by former Australian Greens leader Christine Milne, argues that the electricity created is not essential for energy security (because windfarms added in recent years offer more generation) and does not justify the loss of a central attraction in what became a world heritage wilderness area.

The Tasmanian Liberal government disagrees. It argues Lake Pedder is an important storage site for the Gordon scheme, and helps the state run almost entirely on renewable hydro power. Hydro Tasmania, the state’s publicly owned electricity generation business, says that together the neighbouring Pedder and Gordon lakes offer Australia’s largest water storage capacity. The state energy minister, Guy Barnett, leans hard on the need to expand renewable electricity.How the fight to save Tasmania’s Lake Pedder led to the world’s first green partyRead moreBut campaigners see an opportunity. Two of the dams that led to Pedder’s flooding are ageing and next to a fault line – a crack in the Earth’s crust – formed about 540m years ago. The fault was considered inactive when the dams were built but recent analysis says otherwise. A 2017 report by the state’s auditor general found that both dams should be considered “high risk”.Though the likelihood of an earthquake is low – there are believed to have been only three of a magnitude greater than six in at least the past 48,000 years – any rupture could lead to the flooding of areas south of Hobart, particularly the town of Huonville, which has a population of about 3,000.The loss of Lake Pedder is globally recognised as one the great mistakes of the 20th century Christine MilneThe auditor general suggested that Edgar Dam, which is closest to the fault, may be “susceptible to liquefaction” (collapse) while the second, Scott’s Peak Dam, was deemed “vulnerable to geological faults”.Hydro Tasmania has plans to strengthen both dams, starting with a $21m investment in Edgar Dam next year to remove the concrete face of the dam wall and put in gravel filters and supporting rock. A wave barrier will be added to the top of the dam wall. A government estimate in 2019 suggested similar work at Scott’s Peak Dam could cost $50m.Hydro Tasmania needs to ‘come clean’ on risks, says MilneThe Lake Pedder Restoration committee sees this moment as a fork in the road. Head down one path and the state could spend tens of millions of dollars – Milne estimates more than $100m – to shore up the dams for the indefinite future.Choose the other and it could set an international example of ecosystem restoration on a large scale, meeting a UN call for national governments to commit to ambitious projects in this decade. It would involve gradually releasing 15m depth of water down surrounding rivers, dismantling the dams and investing in re-establishing what was lost in 1972.Crucially, the committee says, there is video evidence, shot two years ago, that the near 1km-wide quartzite beach remains intact under the water.Milne says it was “a beautiful place, and an icon in Australian conservation history” that could be recovered.“The loss of Lake Pedder is globally recognised as one the great mistakes of the 20th century in an ecological sense,” she says. “Its restoration would catapult Tasmania back into global headlights to say: this is a place of outstanding natural beauty which is now leading the world in ecosystem restoration.”Milne says the state government and Hydro Tasmania should “come clean” with the public and release their assessments of what could happen in the event of the dams’ failure. She says a benefit analysis is needed to compare decommissioning the dams with ameliorating the risk of an earthquake. Repairing them would provide what she estimates is 57 megawatts of power-generation capacity, equivalent to a small windfarm. The answer, she says, would be “a no brainer”.Neither the government nor Hydro Tasmania responded directly when asked if such analysis had been carried out. Hydro says it has an emergency plan for each of its dams and that the state emergency service, fire service and police brigade are fully briefed.“We regularly undertake joint emergency preparedness sessions with these organisations,” the organisation’s spokesperson says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He agrees with Milne that the energy it generates could be easily replaced.He says Tasmania has done next to nothing to promote rooftop solar uptake, despite its decent electricity potential, particularly in the north of the state. Mountain says a scheme that encouraged households and businesses to put up panels could fill the gap and provide cheaper power.Pedder ‘vital part’ of energy package, insists BarnettHydro Tasmania says any decision about the future of Lake Pedder rests with the government, but argues Edgar Dam plays an essential role in ensuring adequate energy storage. A Hydro spokesperson says the lake supplies 42% of inflows to the 450MW Gordon power scheme, which is “one of the largest and most important generation assets” the utility has. The scheme is one of only two sites in the state with multi-year water-storage capacity.“As Australia transitions to renewable energy, long-duration energy storage, like that provided by Lake Pedder, is essential to fill the gaps when wind and solar power aren’t available,” a spokesperson says.Hydro also implicitly dismisses the suggestion that this moment is as decisive as the restoration committee claims. It says the Edgar Dam redevelopment will go ahead and is expected to cost the full $21m, but that after an “expert reassessment”, work on Scott’s Peak Dam is not an immediate priority. Its spokesperson says: “It is no longer appropriate to consider both projects in combination.”The Tasmanian government declined to answer questions about the potential benefits of the lake’s restoration or the earthquake risk. Barnett instead focuses on the state’s commitment to get more than 100% of its electricity from renewable energy, including meeting a legislated target of 200% – doubling current generation – by 2040.The government is committed to the Battery of the Nation and Marinus Link projects, under which the state would help replace the mainland’s coal-fired power plants by building pumped hydro storage and wind energy capacity that would send electricity across Bass Strait via a new undersea transmission cable. Both projects are yet to be funded.Lake Pedder in south-west Tasmania, in 1968, before its inundation. Photograph: Sid Game Archive/AlamyShould Tasmania focus on generating power for local use, developing green industries on a scale suitable for the country’s smallest state and protecting sites such as Lake Pedder? Or should it build new renewable energy infrastructure, including in some undeveloped and environmentally sensitive areas, to help the country run on clean electricity?While the Greens are focused on the urgency of the national transition to renewable energy, Milne is firmly in the former camp – as is much of the Tasmanian environmental movement. The Liberal government, despite its federal counterparts’ reluctance to embrace renewables, is in the latter.In Barnett’s words: “Tasmania is poised to be the renewable powerhouse of the country” and Lake Pedder is “a vital part of that overall package”.“In Tasmania, we want to move forward and grow our renewable energy credentials, not go backwards,” he says.Milne says there is another path, one that balances renewable energy with protection, and wants the federal government to step in. “It would be a brilliant decision for the nation’s global standing in demonstrating our stewardship of the world heritage area,” she says. “And it would guarantee community safety by removing any risk of the dams failing. It’s a win-win scenario.”",2023-02-28

",['Peter Hannam'],"Cracks in the unity of the nation’s energy ministers have emerged amid disquiet over a review of power grid plans and an effort by the federal government to force carbon offsets from big new gas fields on to the states.Almost two weeks on from a gathering of energy and climate ministers in Tasmania, senior officials expressed concern about how the review of the integrated system plan (ISP) – the grid’s roadmap – would be handled. One concern was that the federal energy minister, Chris Bowen’s department would be handling the review.“Any review has to align with the ambitions of each jurisdiction,” one official said. “We’re not there for the commonwealth to tell us what to do.”At the meeting, Bowen also surprised state and territory counterparts with a plan for them to pay for the carbon offsets that will be required for the proposed Beetaloo and other new gas fields in the Northern Territory.Eastern Australia hit with rising electricity prices despite record warm weatherRead moreStates, however, pushed back, with Western Australia and Queensland particularly opposed to the precedent of assigning offsets for the so-called scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions that would result, another official said.“No one asked any of us” about the offsets plan, the first official said, adding the market for carbon credits would struggle to cope with existing demand without lumping in major new emissions sources such as Beetaloo. “It’s not our problem.”The meeting’s communique merely stated ministers had “noted the Northern Territory and the commonwealth would undertake work to consider the management of indirect emissions”. The two will report back to a future ministers’ gathering.Two officials who attended the ECMC meeting claimed there had been discussions at a dinner meeting of ministers about the commonwealth underwriting a pipeline to bring Beetaloo gas to southern states, a claim Bowen’s office strongly denied.A spokesperson for Bowen said “there was not, and is not any proposal for the commonwealth to underwrite a gas pipeline from the Beetaloo Basin, or in fact any other gas pipelines. No proposal was put to ECMC because no such proposal exists.”All states but Tasmania are run by Labor governments. Friction over possible outcomes of a “supercharged ISP” and responsibility for emissions offsets point to jockeying among jurisdictions and also impatience over the rollout of renewable energy.

The Clean Energy Council industry group said investors committed to only 400MW of new capacity in the first half of 2023. Some 5 gigawatts – more than 10 times that amount – was needed yearly if emissions reduction goals for the power sector were to be met by 2030, the council said.A spokesperson for Bowen said the Albanese government was “working across the board to get cleaner, cheaper energy into our grid where and when it is needed after 10 years of federal energy policy chaos”.The ISP review was “another piece of critical energy market planning to ensure we have the generation, transmission and storage infrastructure needed to support the national electricity market and east coast gas market throughout the quickening energy transformation,” the spokesperson said.Queensland’s energy minister, Mick de Brenni, said the ISP “was a critical tool in coordinating national focus in the execution of the transition”, adding his state would be looking for future versions of the plan to factor in Queensland’s SuperGrid Infrastructure Blueprint and its renewable energy zone roadmap.“Neither I, nor anyone that I know of in an elected position, has any doubt in the ability of a federal agency to deliver high-quality, independent advice,” De Brenni said.The Beetaloo gas project proposal was the responsibility of the commonwealth and Northern Territory governments, he said.A spokesperson for the South Australian government said that state “looks forward” to participating in the ISP review.“Now that there has been an end to internal squabbling over climate change in the commonwealth government – which resulted in a lost decade of failed energy policies – there is unity on co-ordinating planning for the net-zero emissions economy,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Five Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

Bowen’s office was not approached for comment on that aspect of the article before publication.",2023-07-24
 This article is more than 4 months oldNew fossil fuel projects ‘very unwise economic risk’ says global energy chiefThis article is more than 4 months old,"Fatih Birol, head of International Energy Agency, says countries planning expansion are ‘misjudging market trends’","['Fiona Harvey', '  Environment editor']","Countries and companies planning to expand their fossil fuel production are taking “very unhealthy and unwise economic risks” as their investments may not be profitable, the world’s foremost energy adviser has warned.Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), predicted this week that fossil fuels would peak this decade, a historic turning point for the climate. But despite the likelihood of demand declining, and the threat of climate chaos, many countries and private sector companies are considering new capacity.Birol said: “New large-scale fossil fuel projects not only carry major climate risks, but also business and financial risks for the companies and their investors.“When I talk with the oil companies, both international and national oil companies, some of them are saying that we have been underinvesting in oil and gas. But companies and investors should be very careful about this claim, bearing in mind the demand trajectories we are seeing. It could lead them into taking very unhealthy, unwise economic and climate risks.”Governments should be urgently discussing the phasing-out of fossil fuels at Cop28, the forthcoming UN climate summit, Birol said. The question of phasing out was dropped at last year’s Cop, but many countries plan to reignite the debate this year.Fatih Birol said companies and countries were misjudging the market trends and the mood of the people. Photograph: Simon Maina/AFP/GettyBut even with governments’ current climate policies, which are inadequate and need to be toughened, the amount of oil and gas needed globally will decline, Birol noted.“If you start a project today, wherever you are, the first oil or gas will come to markets in five years, and will come at a time when you will see global oil and gas trends declining,” he told the Guardian in an interview. “Therefore, one should be very careful about not only the climate risk, but also the business risk on large-scale oil and gas projects.”Birol refused to single out any countries, but several developed and developing economies are planning large expansions of their fossil fuel production, despite their commitments to limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The US was this week found to be planning the world’s biggest share of global oil and gas expansion between now and 2050, and the UK government plans scores of new oil and gas licences as the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, vowed to “max out” the North Sea.Fossil fuel companies have a secret weapon. Here’s how Britain can help take it away from them | Cleodie RickardRead moreSeveral countries and companies planning expansions have cited findings from the IEA that oil and gas will still be needed in the future, even when the world reaches net zero greenhouse gas emissions, as justification for their plans. Birol warned that they were not taking on board the IEA’s full advice: “We will definitely need oil and gas in years and years to come, but the issue is the amount of oil and gas we will need globally will be less and less.”He said: “They are misjudging the market trends – they believe what they want to believe. And they also misjudge the mood of the people in the street as far as climate change is concerned, and their responsibility.”Birol applauded the proposed commitment to triple global renewable energy capacity, likely to be a centrepiece of Cop28, which will take place from late November in Dubai. But he said this commitment was insufficient and that the rapid decline of fossil fuels was also needed to keep the world within 1.5C.“The increase of renewables is good, but in the absence of a decline in fossil fuels, the impact on temperature trajectories will be minimal or nothing,” he said. “There should be a discussion [of the phase-out of fossil fuels at Cop28]. And I hope that discussion will give a signal to the markets that fossil fuel consumption will fall.”Warnings that the price of renewable energy could rise were overdone, Birol indicated. “There may be some zigzags [on the price], but the overall trend is they are competitive [with fossil fuels] and will be even more competitive in future,” he said. “Solar is very competitive, and offshore wind is making big steps – soon we will see it competitive as well.”Although he has forecast that fossil fuel use will peak for the first time this decade, Birol said much more needed to be done by governments to ensure that its use declined far more steeply afterwards. “The most important issue is not the peak, but the decline of fossil fuels after the peak, that is the nerve centre of the problem.”Current policies will lead to global heating of 2.4C and must be toughened as a matter of urgency, he said.",
 We’re occupying schools across the world to protest climate inactionYouth activists involved in End Fossil: Occupy!,"We can’t keep sitting in school, pretending everything is all right, and studying as if the planet wasn’t on fire",,"School and university students all over the world are planning to take school strikes one step further and occupy our campuses to demand the end of the fossil economy. Taking a lesson from student activists in the 1960s, the climate justice movement’s youth will shut down business as usual. Not because we don’t like learning, but because what we’ve learned already makes it clear that, without a dramatic break from this system, we cannot ensure a livable planet for our presents and futures.Why occupy? Because we’ve marched. We’ve launched petitions. We’ve written open letters. We’ve had meetings with governments, boards and commissions. We’ve struck. We’ve filled squares, streets and avenues with thousands and, all together, millions of people in continents across this Earth. We’ve screamed with all our lungs. Some of us have even participated in blockades, sit-ins and die-ins. And just as it seemed the seed for deep and radical social transformation was taking root in the midst of the massive 2019 climate mobilizations, Covid-19 came, and our momentum drastically decreased. What didn’t decrease, however, was the greenhouse gas emissions, the exploitation of the global south and the unimaginable profits hoarded by the fossil fuel industry.It’s no secret that our enemy, the fossil fuel industry, rules the world. And it is far from falling; in fact, it is stronger than ever. Proof is a recent investigation by the Guardian that revealed to the world that the fossil fuel empire has 195 “carbon bomb” projects that threaten our hope for a global warming of up to 1.5C, the safe barrier. That’s right: despite our politicians’ and institutions’ indeed hilarious show at Cop26 in 2021, the biggest oil companies are on track to spend $103m on planetary destruction projects every day for the rest of the decade.What’s more, the climate crisis is not a fair crisis. The latest IPCC reports show that the ones who are most affected by climate change are often the ones who have done the least in causing it in the first place. As young people born right at the edge of the biggest catastrophe in human history, it is our historic responsibility to rise up to stop it.So, what do we do? Since giving in to defeatism will never be an option for us, we must now organize at a massive scale. We need to create a new peak of mobilization, even bigger than 2019. If we were waiting for a sign, this is it. With temperatures climbing faster and faster, we have never been so certain that mobilizing bigger than ever is not only possible, but existentially necessary.We cannot repeat previous mistakes. We need to be more disruptive than ever, as that’s our only chance for survival. The youth’s innovation and creativity, combined with a fierce appetite for disruption and liberation, can change the world. As a global generation of students, we need to disrupt business as usual, and start with the spaces where we have the power to mobilize and organize – our schools and universities. Sometimes they are directly implicated in the destruction business, as is the case of the many universities that invest in the fossil fuel industry, such as Oxford, Stanford, Princeton, Yale, McGill, Northwestern, MIT, etc. In other cases, they are indirectly linked to it. They train us for a world that has no future, a world of fossil capitalism. They want us to sit in school and learn as if everything was fine. But the world we are learning for – the world that created the climate crisis – has no future. The big question of our generation, “How do we create a world without climate catastrophe?”, will not be answered by sitting in school.The bottom line is: we can’t keep pretending everything is all right, studying as if the planet wasn’t on fire. As other students did before us – from the students of May of ’68 in France to the Arab spring, from the Chilean Penguin Revolution and Primavera Secundarista in Brazil to Occupy Wall Street, we will stop our business-as-usual lives to show our governments and society that we need to change everything, now. From Lisbon to California, from Peru to Germany and from Madrid to Ivory Coast, we call on young people to get together and organize an international revolutionary generation that can change the system.Between September and December 2022, we will occupy hundreds of schools and universities worldwide to end the fossil economy at the international level under the callout to action “End Fossil: Occupy!”. We invite anyone and everyone to join us and organize occupations in their school or universities, as long as they follow our three principles: youth-led occupation, climate justice framework, and occupy until we win. We will revive the youth movement, create new alliances, radicalize, engage the whole of society to support and occupy, and envision the world we want – where life and not profit is at the center – through this sparking international action moment. We will rise up in justice and liberation to crush the fossil fuel industry. We shall have no doubt: the youth are a revolutionary subject. We will turn the tide, change history, and smash the fossil economy.We are here. We are radical. We are ready to occupy.
This open letter was written by youth activists involved in End Fossil: Occupy! and signed by organizers and groups around the world

" World’s feral pigs produce as much CO2 as 1.1m cars each year, study finds",Researchers estimate the invasive species releases 4.9m metric tonnes of greenhouse gas annually by uprooting soil,"['Donna Lu', '@donnadlu']","The climate impact of wild pigs around the world is equivalent to the greenhouse gas emissions of 1.1m cars annually, according to new research.Modelling by an international team of researchers estimates that feral pigs release 4.9m metric tonnes of carbon dioxide each year globally by uprooting soil.Researcher Dr Christopher O’Bryan of the University of Queensland said feral pigs were one of the most widespread vertebrate invasive species on the planet.Florida's feral hogs: a pervasive pest – but a profitable one for someRead more“Pigs are native to Europe and parts of Asia, but they’ve been introduced to every continent except Antarctica,” he said.“When we think of climate change, we tend to think of the classic fossil fuel problem. This is one of the additional threats to carbon, and to climate change potentially, that hasn’t really been explored in any global sense.”Feral hogs uproot soil while searching for food, in a process O’Bryan likens to “mini tractors that are ploughing soil”. Doing so exposes microbes in the soil to oxygen. The microbes “reproduce at a rapid rate and then that can produce carbon emissions [in the form of] CO2.”“Any form of land-use change can have an effect on carbon emissions from the soil,” O’Bryan said. “The same thing happens when you put a tractor through a field or you deforest land.”The researchers estimate that wild pigs are uprooting an area upwards of 36,000 sq km (14,000 sq miles) in regions where they are not native.Oceania had the largest area of land disturbed by wild pigs – roughly 22,000 sq km – followed by North America. The pigs in Oceania accounted for more than 60% of the animal’s estimated yearly emissions, emitting nearly 3m metric tonnes of CO2, equivalent to about 643,000 cars.The findings of the study, published in the journal Global Change Biology, were drawn from three models. One model predicted wild pig density globally across 10,000 simulations, based on existing information about wild pig populations and locations.A second model converted pig density into an area of disturbed land, and a third estimated the amount of CO2 emitted when soil is disturbed.Nicholas Patton, a PhD student at the University of Canterbury, said there was some uncertainty in the modelling as a result of the variability of the carbon content in soils and the densities of wild pigs in different areas.“Areas that are peat bogs or black soils … especially ones that have a lot of moisture, they’re a sink for carbon,” said Patton. “When pigs get in there and root around, they have a lot more potential for that carbon to be released [than from other soils].”In addition to their climate impacts, the destructive impact of wild hogs has been well documented. O’Bryan said managing the animals was a challenge that would involve prioritising whichever of their impacts was deemed most significant.“If all we care about is agriculture, then the cost and the benefits of managing pigs will be different than if all we cared about was carbon emissions, than if all we cared about was biodiversity.“At the end of the day, feral pigs are a human problem. We’ve spread them around the world. This is another human-mediated climate impact.”",2019-06-22
" Amount of litter on UK beaches is falling, national clean-up finds","But 75% of waste is still plastic or polystyrene and ‘piecemeal’ government approach not good enough, say campaigners","['Damian Carrington', ' Environment editor']","The amount of waste washing up on the UK’s beaches is falling year by year, according to the results of the 2021 Great British Beach Clean, organised by the Marine Conservation Society (MCS).Volunteers found 385 pieces of litter for every 100 metres of beach on average, down from 425 in 2020 and 558 in 2019. Single-use plastic bags have fallen from a high of 13 for every 100 metres in 2013 to just three in 2021. The plastic bag charge introduced in 2015 has cut their use in supermarkets by 95%.Beach litter levels have continued to fall in the UKPlastic cotton bud sticks dropped out of the top 10 most common types of rubbish following a ban in Scotland in 2019 and in England in 2020. The average of six per 100 metres in 2021 was the lowest since the beach cleans began 28 years ago and was down from 15 in 2020.The MCS said the results were positive and showed that actions being taken at a personal, local and national level were having an impact. But it said 75% of beach litter was still plastic or polystyrene and that the government’s “piecemeal” approach to phasing out single-use plastic was not good enough.The beach clean took place from 17-26 September and more than 6,000 volunteers cleared five tonnes of litter from 34 miles (55km) of UK beaches. The most common items were pieces of plastic and polystyrene, followed by cigarette butts, crisp and sweet packets, and plastic caps and lids.Taxes and bans have helped cut plastic bag and cotton bud stick litterRecent research showed plastic items from takeaway food and drink dominated the litter in the world’s oceans. A study in 2020 found the UK and US produced more plastic waste per person than any other major countries.The UK government took its latest step towards banning single-use plastic plates, cutlery and cups on Saturday, when it launched a consultation along with a call for evidence on how to cut litter from wet wipes, cigarette filters and plastic sachets.The consultation had been trailed in August when campaigners said progress on cutting plastic waste was “snail-paced”, with the EU having banned many items in July. A deposit return scheme (DRS) for plastic bottles will not be in place in England until late 2024 at the earliest, six years after being proposed by the government. A Scottish DRS scheme has also been delayed until 2023.Dr Laura Foster, the head of clean seas at the MCS, said: “The UK governments’ current piecemeal approach to single-use plastics policy just won’t cut it any more. While we’re seeing a downward trend in litter on beaches, we’re still seeing huge volumes of plastic washing up on our shores. Comprehensive and ambitious single-use plastics policies are the quickest way of phasing out plastic from our environment.”Lizzie Prior, beachwatch officer at MCS, said it was difficult to say how much changes in people’s behaviour during the pandemic had influenced litter trends: “There were changes in lunchtime eating habits, with fewer people in the office and therefore a reduction in single-use lunchtime plastic. But some of the downward trends, such as plastic bags, were occurring before the pandemic.”She said PPE waste was found on one in three beaches, though masks were only the 59th most common item.A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, said: “We’re pleased to see the amount of litter being found on our beaches dropping and the positive impact of our policies such as the single-use carrier bag charge. However we know there is more to be done.”Environment, pollution and climate change is now the British public’s top concern, according to a poll by Ipsos Mori published on Wednesday. Twice as many people named climate and environment as a top issue than cited the economy, a result the pollsters had not seen before. As in previous surveys, green concerns were found to be high across age, social class and the political spectrum.",2021-11-25
Cookbook puts pigeon pea on Malawi’s plates to combat food insecurity,Book aims to change attitudes to nutritious pulse the country produces in  abundance for export but rarely eats at home,"['Supported by', 'About this content', 'Lizzy Davies']","As recipes go, the ideas sound tempting if not particularly groundbreaking: one is for dal, another for meatballs, and a third for “six food-group porridge” (with an optional egg).The suggestions in a new Malawian cookery book are also, in their own way, quietly revolutionary, as they are all made with an ingredient that the country produces in abundance but has often been overlooked: the pigeon pea.A drought-resistant legume that thrives in the dry fields of southern Malawi, the pigeon pea is an essential part of the diet of millions of people around the world, particularly in India where it is eaten as a staple alongside rice and roti.In Malawi, Africa’s leading producer, the pulse has generally been regarded as “desperation food” eaten when there is no alternative. Just 10% of the 400,000 tonnes the country produces each year is consumed domestically.Now, like so much of Africa, Malawians are suffering a multi-layered crisis due to the climate emergency, the Covid pandemic and soaring costs of agricultural essentials, such as fertiliser and wheat.Susan Chimbayo, the chair of the Nandolo Farmers’ Association (NFA), wants the Pigeon Peas recipe book, published last month, to remind people that they may have a locally grown, drought-hardy and nutritious alternative right under their noses.“People [in Malawi] don’t really know what can be done with the pigeon pea. We are just growing it for export. But it can be consumed locally and the market will be ready. Pigeon peas can do wonders,” she says. The dal featured in the cookery book, she adds, is “so delicious, you won’t stop eating it”.The Black Sea blockade: mapping the impact of war in Ukraine on the world’s food supply – interactiveRead moreIn theory, pigeon peas have several advantages. They are easy to cultivate, requiring minimal input in terms of fertiliser, pesticides and irrigation, and are cheap when grown from recycled seed. They can easily be grown alongside other crops, such as maize, sorghum and peanuts.In practice, though, Malawi’s pigeon pea farmers have come up against a host of challenges, from floods and cyclones to exploitative middlemen who target isolated farmers and promise them a sale at very low prices. On top of that, says Chimbayo, the average farmer does not have the space to store the crop properly, with the result that the quality suffers.In recent years, she says, several warehouses have been built, as part of a wider partnership with the charity Christian Aid and AquAid, a watercooler supplier, that aims to boost the pigeon pea sector and tackle poverty. The warehouses, she adds, not only provide storage but also increase the negotiating power of the farmers, who can collectively market their produce instead of haggling on an individual basis.“They get together and have a powerful voice to say: ‘No, you buy the pigeon peas at such and such a price,’” says Chimbayo. The NFA, which was formed in 2015 and has about 11,000 paying members, says it plays a central role in helping its farmers get a better price with buyers.By forming cooperatives, farmers can collectively market their produce instead of haggling on an individual basis. Photograph: Christian AidAlthough only 200 copies of the cookery book have been published, Chimbayo says she has been fending off demands for republication by the Ministry of Agriculture’s field extension workers, who work with communities on farming practices.‘Fonio just grows naturally’: could ancient indigenous crops ensure food security for Africa?Read morePatrick Watt, the CEO of Christian Aid, says indigenous African crops have a major role to play in helping low-income countries become more resilient.“We keep going round in circles on this. Each of these crises gets more severe. We have to be asking ourselves: ‘What is it that breaks the cycle?’ Obviously, it’s not one thing, but part of the solution has got to be that African countries invest more seriously in agriculture and in reducing their exposure to volatility in food, energy and fertiliser markets, and are doing that in an environmentally sustainable way and a way that supports nutrition. And traditional African crops have a really important role to play in that.”Some suggest such crops have been stigmatised and are regarded as inferior because of a lingering colonial mentality. “There is a need [for a] decolonisation of African agriculture,” says Watt.As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine pushes up the prices of staple foods, Malawi’s smallholder farmers are struggling to keep their heads above water, Chimbayo says. “It’s only by the grace of God that we’re still managing to survive. At the end of the day the prices that we get [for our produce are] not really exciting, but we are the same ones who buy the same expensive fertiliser.”The situation in rural villages was “really worrisome”, she adds. “But we keep telling [rural farmers] that the pigeon pea that they’ve grown, they can still use it and eat it – they shouldn’t sell all of it, because they will need it at one time or the other.”Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:Sign up for Global Dispatch – please check your spam folder for the confirmation email",2022-10-19
,"Fewer than 2,000 rhino remain in Kenya, and the country’s wildlife service needs to keep tabs on them to make sure they thrive. It’s a major undertaking, involving a helicopter, 4x4s and a lot of rangers
Words and photographs by Peter Muiruri",['The age of extinction is supported by'],"Kenya has the world’s third largest rhinoceros population: a total of 1,890 including 966 black rhinos, 922 southern white and two northern white. But how to keep track of them and ensure the species are thriving? Every two or three years, Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) carries out an ear-notching exercise in all rhino sanctuaries in the country to ensure that at least 60% of the animals are uniquely identifiable.An ear-notch is a pattern unique to an individual rhino within a specific ecosystem that helps rangers and researchers keep accurate records and monitor the rhino’s health.
Here comes a chopper … a helicopter is used to dart the highly aggressive black rhino
In March, 40 rhinos within Lewa and Borana conservancies in Kenya were marked in a week-long exercise run by the veterinary and capture team from KWS. It included fitting digital transmitters to 10 black rhinos to track their movements and help mitigate human-wildlife conflicts.
The team secure a darted rhino with nylon rope, then take its temperature and use a pulsemeter to monitor its heart rate and blood oxygenation
The LoRa (long-range) transmitters identify rhinos both in the field and in the office using EarthRanger software. Data collected from the software is combined with field records to provide a report on wildlife, rangers’ activities, asset deployment and general infrastructure in a protected area.
The kindest cut: sterile scissors are used to make the notch on the rhino’s ear
In addition to ear-notching and fitting digital transmitters, transponders are also embedded into rhino horns to link illegally acquired horns to individual animals for stronger prosecution cases in wildlife poaching trials.The first step in ear-notching a highly aggressive black rhino involves firing a dart with a tranquilliser gun from a helicopter. A 4x4 is normally used for the more docile white rhino. The well-coordinated exercise takes about 10 minutes for each animal.
Next comes a squirt of an antiseptic spray to prevent infections
“Ear-notching is one of our strategic rhino-management plans,” says Dr Isaac Lekolool, head of veterinary and capture services at KWS. “Each country has its own ear-notch patterns, with Kenya using a V-shape and a hole in the ear. However, we do not tranquillise a pregnant rhino in its third trimester or one with a very young calf.”Samples of blood, body tissue and dung are sent for laboratory analysis, DNA profiling and research.
Step by step, the complex operation continues: an oxygen tank pumps air into the rhino’s nostrils, and dung and tissue samples are taken
Lewa is home to more than 200 rhinos, accounting for approximately 13% of the national population. Data from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites) shows that Africa had 22,137 rhinos – 6,195 black and 15,942 white – at the end of 2021.‘A second chance’: Peru sanctuaries help rescued monkeys back into the wildRead moreThe number of rhinos poached in Kenya has fallen, with no recorded cases in 2020, and six in 2021, according to the IUCN. Within the African continent, poaching rates declined from 5.3% of the total population in 2015 to 2.3% in 2021.
As work finishes on another rhino, a transmitter (top right) is added, allowing the team to monitor the animal back at HQ at Lewa conservancy (above). Meanwhile, the animals bear temporary numbers that will wear off in time
Yet black rhino remain critically endangered and the white rhino near threatened on the IUCN red list, so the organisation recommends strict surveillance of the animals.
A large team is used to ensure the whole process takes only 10 minutes, keeping stress for the rhino at a minimum
“The overall decline in poaching of rhinos is encouraging, yet this remains an acute threat to the survival of these iconic animals,” says Sam Ferreira, scientific officer with the IUCN SSC African Rhino Specialist Group.“To support the growth of rhino numbers, it is essential to continue active population management and anti-poaching activities for all subspecies across different range states.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",2023-04-17
Battle for clean air: the row raging over London’s ultra-low emission zone,A planned extension to the capital’s ‘Ulez’ has become a political battleground as opponents take legal action to stop it while others say drastic action is vital to fight pollution,['James Tapper'],"As parents walk with their children next to four lanes of fume-belching traffic in Kingston, Oliver Lord sighs. “We shouldn’t be setting a carer with a car against a mum looking after her son with asthma in hospital,” says Lord, who is head of strategy for the Clean Cities campaign.He and other campaigners are dismayed at how clean air has become a political battleground, with tensions rising over plans to extend an ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) to cover the whole of Greater London.Last week, Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, was confronted by protesters carrying a sign depicting him with a swastika and a hammer and sickle at a public meeting in Ealing, west London. Khan himself did little to calm matters, claiming that people with legitimate objections to the Ulez expansion had been “joining hands” with the far right. “Some of those outside are part of the far right,” he said. “Some are Covid deniers. Some are vaccine deniers and some are Tories.”Oliver Lord, head of strategy for the Clean Cities campaign, beside an air-quality monitor in Kingston upon Thames. Photograph: Andy Hall/The ObserverThe unlikely coalition of London Ulez opponents ranges from Jacob Rees-Mogg, the MP for North East Somerset, and Conservative-controlled councils in and around London to anti-vaccination activists including Richard Fairbrass of Right Said Fred and Piers Corbyn.But it includes plenty of ordinary people too, from builders and sales managers to chefs and carers. Consumer finance expert Martin Lewis, speaking alongside Khan at an event on the cost of living last month, also raised concerns. “The reasons behind [expanding Ulez] are good, but the timing is pretty tough to do it this year in a cost of living crisis.”The Ulez was Boris Johnson’s plan, originally confined to the city centre, but expanded in 2021 by Khan to cover inner London. Drivers of the most polluting cars and vans must pay £12.50 a day or face a fine, while HGVs and buses pay £100.London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, plans to extend the ultra-low emission zone to Greater London in August. Photograph: Victoria Jones/PASince then, the majority of the most polluting vehicles have gone from inner London and emissions of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are 26% lower. City Hall points out that only 6% of vehicles pay the charge.The mayor intends to expand the zone on 29 August and has launched a £110m scrappage scheme with up to £2,000 compensation for low-income drivers and up to £9,500 for van-driving small businesses and charities.Yet that will not be enough to help tradespeople and key workers. Perhaps seeing an opportunity to make life awkward for a political opponent, the Conservative government has rejected the Labour mayor’s request to top up the scrappage fund, despite giving similar amounts for schemes in Manchester as well as in Bradford and Birmingham.Surrey county council has allied with other Tory-controlled outer London boroughs – Bexley, Bromley, Harrow and Hillingdon – to launch a legal challenge to the extension.If the Ulez extension is stymied, it would leave residents of places like Kingston-upon-Thames still breathing some of the most toxic air in the capital. Depending on the weather, roads in outer London have “a lot more pollution than we may see in inner London, just simply because the vehicles are cleaner”, according to Prof Frank Kelly, head of Imperial College’s Environmental Research Group.Ulez expansion mapLondon’s expanding Ulez map.Standing next to one of the roadside air pollution monitors that measures pollution along Cromwell Road in Kingston, Oliver Lord points to rows of flats and a school next to three lanes of traffic.“This has been showing illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide for 12 years, even though they were meant to end in 2010,” he says. “A whole generation of kids has grown up in Kingston with harmful levels of air pollution.”This particular air pollution monitor – a curious combination of tubes, funnels and vents on a box at the side of the Cromwell Road – shows an annual average of 43 micrograms per cubic metre – four times the guideline set by the World Health Organization.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But if you’re on a cycle ride down the Cromwell Road, you’re inhaling fumes that have a very detrimental effect on your heart.”Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah has been a clean air campaigner since the death in 2013 of her nine-year-old daughter, Ella, who the coroner ruled was a victim of air pollution.

She had asthma, and her mother had to perform CPR to resuscitate her “time after time”, she told the Observer. When Ella died, a coroner ruled she had been a victim of air pollution, and the government pledged to act.“And they haven’t done what they’re meant to do,” she says. “How much have they contributed to the scrappage scheme? Zero. Londoners pay huge amounts in excise duty. Where’s our money? Don’t be playing games with Londoners.“Poor people are being used. People on universal credit aren’t driving cars – they’re waiting at bus stops in the fumes.”Adoo-Kissi-Debrah said ministers should “listen to Chris Whitty”, after England’s chief medical officer said indoor spaces should be monitored for air quality.Although Surrey county council is part of the lawsuit trying to stop the Ulez, the council’s cabinet member for transport, Matt Furniss, says the council agreed with the principle. “Our concerns are about the significant financial and social impact on Surrey residents and businesses who need to cross the boundary every day,” he says.The council wants the mayor to extend the scrappage scheme to some of estimated 160,000 cars in Surrey which are not Ulez compliant, extend public transport into the county, exempt key workers from the charge and fund better bus routes in Surrey.“That’s why we’ve launched the legal action to get the Mayor of London and TfL to engage with us,” he adds.Khan, though, is pressing on. “If it’s good enough for those in central London, why isn’t it good enough for those in outer London?” he told the meeting in Ealing. “Clean Air is a human right, not a privilege.”",2023-08-04
ObituaryDongria Kondh obituary,,['Ros Berrington'],"My friend Dongria Kondh, who has died aged 65 of cancer, was an environmental activist in the north of England whose main focus was on climate change.In the late 1990s she founded Treesponsibility, a not-for-profit community group dedicated to raising awareness about climate change in the Calder Valley area of West Yorkshire, where she lived. Following floods in the Calder Valley, she also became a strong advocate of natural flood defences, spearheading a local Ban the Burn campaign against the damaging practice of burning and draining peat bogs on grouse shooting estates.Dongria was born Penny Eastwood in Newbury, Berkshire. She never knew her birth parents, and was adopted by William and Patricia Eastwood, whose surname she took. After attending Millfield school in Somerset, in 1971 she went to the University of Warwick, where she met Jon Tattersall, a fellow student. They had two children, Kate and Jem, and moved to Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire in 1987, before separating in 1990.In 1987 she researched climate change at the University of Bradford, where she gained a first-class degree in peace studies and had her dissertation, Responding to Global Warming: An Examination of the Prospects for Effective Action, published as part of the Bradford Peace Studies Papers series in 1992.To coincide with the Rio Earth Summit that year, she organised a two week Walk for the Earth from Manchester to London, on which she met Billy Frugal, a psychiatric nurse, whom she married in 1994. For most of the rest of her life, as she became expert at tapping bodies for funds, her environmental work was supported through various grants and schemes.In 1998 she founded Treesponsibility, which, apart from its campaigning work on climate change, encouraged the planting of thousands of trees. I was a volunteer for Treesponsibility, and it was through that connection that the two of us met in 1998.In 2010, she changed her name from Penny Eastwood to Dongria Kondh as part of a campaign against proposed British investment in a bauxite mine on land inhabited by the Dongria Kondh tribe in India, on one occasion glueing herself to the offices of the Royal Bank of Scotland. After a long battle, the Dongria Kondh successfully saved their lands, but she retained her new name.Dongria was a force of nature, a kind, pragmatic and humorous woman who found happiness in her environmental work. With her quick intellect, she understood well before most of her contemporaries that climate change is the biggest threat to the planet, and dedicated herself to trying to create positive change. To relax, she loved storytelling and was a demon Scrabble player.She is survived by Billy, Kate and Jem, and her granddaughters, Eva and Harriet.",2021-09-17
