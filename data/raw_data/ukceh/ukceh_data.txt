1    The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2023      Version  Date  Updates  1.0  16/05/2024  First version 2    Purpose  This is the user guide for the new UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2023, LCM2023. The LCM2023 product  consists of seven datasets, three each for Great Britain and Northern Ireland comprising a 10 m  dataset of classified pixels, a dataset of classified land parcels, and a 25 m pixel dataset or rasterised  land parcels. A further 1 km summary raster product covering both Great Britain and Northern Ireland  is also available. Appropriate use of complex data requires a deeper understanding than structure and  content. We therefore describe data production, validation and data accuracy. Our goal is to help  users make informed decisions regarding the application UKCEH LCM data in their current and future  work.

Bootstrap Training datasets are used by a Random Forest to classify Classification Scenes.  Context Raster: A multi-band raster with contextual information, such as terrain, coastal and urban  proximity. Context Rasters are combined with Seasonal Composite Images to create Classification  Scenes.  Classification Scene: A multi-layer raster comprising spectral information from a Seasonal Composite  Image and Context Rasters. Classification Scenes are classified to yield a pixel land cover classification.  Seasonal Composite Image: A multi-band raster representing spectral observations across four  seasons. These are designed to provide temporal, phenological information that a classifier can use to  differentiate vegetation types.    UKCEH Land Cover Classes: A set of land cover classes defined by UKCEH, derived from the UK  Biodiversity Action Plan Broad Habitats (Jackson et. al. 2000).  UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework: A database of land parcel objects derived from generalising  national cartography in order to remove unnecessary detail. All UKCEH LCM Land Parcel datasets use  this spatial framework. 4    Introduction  In this document we capitalise the first letters of some specific terminology. In most cases the meaning  of these terms should be clear from the text, but for extra clarity a glossary is provided for these  capitalised terms. Land cover types are also capitalised and/or italicised; these are described in  appendices.   LCM2023 is the eleventh UK land cover map produced by UKCEH (others include LCM1990, 2000,  2007, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022). Land cover is given as 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes  based on Biodiversity Broad Habitats (BAP, see Jackson 2000). LCM2023 was created by classifying  Classification Scenes comprising Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Images combined with a series of  Context Layers designed to reduce spectral confusion. The classification process is automatic, using a  technique we call Bootstrap Training, combined with a Random Forest classifier.    Historically, because of high costs associated with labour intensive image pre-processing and  gathering training data, there has been lag of approximately ten years between UKCEH LCMs.   However, using new automated techniques we are able to produce new land cover maps annually.  These methods are still evolving and we seek continuous improvements. If new methods yield  significant improvements in accuracy, we will consider re-application across the entire catalogue. This  will maximise temporal consistency, comparability and the potential for change detection, which is a  fundamental goal for our land cover mapping. A benefit of annual production is that it helps to  differentiate errors from real-world change. Most classification errors are random in space and time,  so should not occur at exactly the same location year-after-year. With a rich time-series of land cover  maps random errors will flicker on and off, whilst real land surface changes will persist. We therefore  anticipate that as the annual series matures, UKCEH annual land cover maps will become an essential  tool for monitoring the state and change of the UK countryside and support a wide range of  environmental objectives Formal validation of LCM2023 gives an overall accuracy of 83%, at full  thematic detail.    UK CEH Land Cover Classes and BAP Broad Habitat Classes  At the turn of the century, conservation and regulatory agencies had reporting obligations under the  UK Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP, Jackson et al. 2000) and were co-funding stakeholders of LCM2000  and LCM2007. Therefore, the 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes are closely related to Biodiversity Action  Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats, but they are not identical. BAP Broad Habitats were designed for field- based detection by botanists rather than via satellite remote sensing, therefore there are slight  deviations. Agencies no longer have reporting obligations under the UK BAP, but we retain the land  cover descriptions to preserve consistency and comparability with earlier products.  Describing complex land cover and habitat types that share similar nomenclatures and similar (but not  equal) meanings precisely with words can ambiguous. In most cases we could refer to UKCEH Land  Cover Classes and BAP Broad Habitats synonymously without causing confusion, however we  sometimes we need to contrast them. To reduce ambiguity regarding land cover and habitat  descriptions, we therefore italicise UK BAP Broad Habitats when explicitly referring to these. At all  times when referring to a defined class (UKCEH or UK BAP) we will begin each element with a capital  letter. For example:  Improved Grassland refers to the UKCEH Land Cover Class, Improved Grassland  the BAP habitat.    Some users do not require the full thematic detail of UKCEH Land Cover Classes so we also provide  generalised land cover UKCEH Aggregate Classes in our Land Parcel product. Table 1 shows the  relationship between UKCEH Land Cover Classes and Aggregate Classes, with the UK BAP Broad 5    Habitats. Usually there is a one-to-one relationship between UK BAP Broad Habitats and derived  UKCEH Land Cover Classes. However, the UK BAP Standing water and Canals and the UK BAP Rivers  and Streams are represented by a single UKCEH Land Cover Class, Freshwater. There is not a UK BAP  for saltwater, but we separate saltwater and freshwater when possible, so include a UKCEH LCM  Saltwater class. In two cases, we have found it appropriate to split UK BAP Broad Habitats. The UK BAP  Dwarf Shrub and Heath class is split into UKCEH Land Cover Classes Heather and Heather grassland.  The UK BAP Built up Areas and Gardens class is split into UKCEH Land Cover Classes Urban and  Suburban. Fuller details are given in Appendices 1 & 2.  Table 1. Relationship between UK CEH Aggregate classes, UK BAP Broad Habitats (Jackson 2000,  highlighted in green) and UKCEH Land Cover class and associated integer identifiers. Additional notes  on the on the relationships between UKCEH Land Cover Classes and UK BAP Broad Habitats are given  in Appendices 1 and 2 together with satellite-based mapping considerations.

Appendix 3 gives the official dataset name for each of these digital holdings.   10 m Classified Pixel datasets  The 10 m pixel datasets are produced from multiple classified Classification Scenes that are compiled  to create a single mosaic of national cover. The Random Forest classifier derives a probability of  membership for each class. The class with the highest is the most likely land cover. The first band of  the 10 m pixel dataset is an integer representing the most likely UKCEH Land Cover Class. The second  band is the probability that was associated with this result; this gives an indication of the confidence  of the classification (Figure 1).  Unlike pixels of the 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel dataset, the 10 m Classified Pixels have not been  generalised by combination with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework. This preserves intricate  features of the landscape such as narrow linear features and small patches of habitat that fall below  the 0.5 hectare minimum mappable unit (MMU) of the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework. We  anticipate that this extra detail will be of interest and useful but please note the formal validation  exercises were performed against the 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel dataset, not the 10 m Classified  Pixels.     Figure 1. Left; 10 m classified pixels. Right; the probability associated with each classified pixel; this is  an indicator of classification confidence.    Land Parcel datasets  The Land Parcel datasets are the result of intersecting the 10 m Classified Pixel datasets with the  UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework to generate land parcel attributes (Figure 2, Table 3). 7      Figure 2.

UKCEH LCM Land Parcel product attributes for LCM2023.  UKCEH LCM attribute name  Example  Description  gid    10079  This is a unique identifier for  the land parcel.  _hist  2:3, 11:361  This describes the frequency of  10 m pixels per UKCEH land 8    cover class encountered in a  land parcel given as a list of  tuples <left>:<right> separated  by commas. The figure to the  left of the colon per tuple  represents the UKCEH Land  Cover Class identifier, to the  right  the  frequency  of  occurrence.  _mode  11  This is the most frequently  occurring (modal) land cover  type.  _purity  99.06  This is the percentage of the  modal land cover class over the  total number of pixels (_n)  encountered.  _conf  93.88  This when combined with  _purity helps to understand  classification confidence. It is  the mean polygon value of the  class membership probability  for each pixel, rescaled to the  range of 0 to 100.  _stdev  9.51  This is the standard deviation  of _conf.  _agg  6  This is the aggregate class (see  Table 1).  _n  319  This is the total number of 10 m  pixels intersecting the land  parcel.  ogc_fid  415793  A unique parcel identifier  attribute required during the  production of the spatiaLite  vector product. It is preferable  to use the gid attribute rather  than ogc_fid.    25 m Pixel Rasterised Land Parcel datasets  These are the result of rasterising the Land Parcel dataset into 25 m pixels, with the pixel origin  matching the origin of the British National Grid (for Great Britain) or the Irish National Grid (for  Northern Ireland). Three attributes are carried from the Land Parcel datasets, giving a 3-band raster.   Band 1 is the dominant land cover _mode; band 2 is _conf; and band 3 _purity (see Figure 3). 9      Figure 3. Left top, rasterised land parcels at 25 m pixel resolution. Right-top mean parcel most likely  land cover probability (_conf). Bottom per parcel purity (_purity).    1 km raster products  The 1 km products for LCM2023 were created by summarising the LCM2023 25 m raster data set to  produce percentage cover for each class and to identify the dominant (most widespread) class in each  1 km pixel. The products at 1 km are:   - Dominant cover at 1 km for LCM2023 classes (1 band)   - Dominant cover at 1 km for LCM2023 Aggregate classes (1 band)   - Percentage cover at 1 km for LCM2023 classes (21 bands)   - Percentage cover at 1 km for LCM2023 Aggregate classes (10 bands) 10    For the percentage cover products, integer values are reported, so the rounding of each value means  that in some cases the sum of all the layers may be slightly above or below 100. Around the coast the  values will be sum to less than 100 reflecting the proportion of mapped area in the 1 km square. One  1 km x 1 km pixel covers the area of 1600 25 m pixels, consequently, a land cover type has to cover  more than sixteen 25 m-pixels to exceed 1% of the 1 km pixel area, and hence have a percentage cover  value in the 1 km percentage cover data sets.    Material and Methods  Seasonal Composite Images  Seasonal Composite Images for classification were derived from Google Earth Engine. Sentinel-2  surface reflectance values were resampled to 10 m pixel resolution and median reflectance was  computed for four time periods: January-March, April-June, July-September, and October-December,  using ten Sentinel-2 bands 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8a, 11, and 12 (after Carrasco et. al., 2019), see Table 4.  There were occasional seasonal gaps in the Seasonal Composite Images due to persistent cloud in an  image compositing period which were represented by null data. Fortunately, these data gaps never  occurred at a single location in all four of the Seasonal Composites, ensuring that at least some  Sentinel-2 satellite data were available for classification. Our classification algorithm will tolerate  partially complete spectral information, so we were able to produce land cover for the whole of the  UK without the need to manually fill gaps.   Table 4.

For example, bare rocks in the littoral coastal zone lack significant vegetation, so too do exposed  mountain rocks and sealed urban surfaces. Spectrally these surfaces can appear very similar when  viewed from space and extra detail is required to differentiate them. We used 10 m Context Rasters  to resolve a range of confusion types. For Great Britain, the 10 m Context Rasters were:  1. Height, derived from the NEXTMap® terrain product from Intermap® Solutions.  2. Aspect, derived from the NEXTMap® terrain product from Intermap® Solutions.  3. Slope, derived from the NEXTMap® terrain product from Intermap® Solutions. 11    4. Distance from the nearest building, derived from Ordnance Survey open data.  5. Distance from road, derived from Ordnance Survey open data.  6. Distance from tidal water, derived from Ordnance Survey open data.  7. Distance from freshwater, derived from Ordnance Survey open data.  8. A foreshore binary mask, derived from Ordnance Survey open data.  9. A woodland binary mask, derived from Ordnance Survey open data.  10. A saltmarsh binary mask, derived from Environment Agency, Scottish Government and  Natural Resources Wales open data.  For Northern Ireland 10 m Context Rasters were:  1. Height, derived from the NEXTMap® terrain product from Intermap® Solutions.  2. Aspect, derived from the NEXTMap® terrain product from Intermap® Solutions.  3. Slope, derived from the NEXTMap® terrain product from Intermap® Solutions.  4. An urban binary mask derived from open data of the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research  Agency.  5. A distance to coast layer derived from the Ordnance Survey or Northern Ireland open data.  6. A distance to freshwater layer derived from the Ordnance Survey or Northern Ireland open  data.  7. A distance to road layer derived from the Ordnance Survey or Northern Ireland open data.  8. A foreshore binary mask, derived from Ordnance Survey or Northern Ireland open data.  9. A tidal water binary mask, derived from Ordnance Survey or Northern Ireland open data.    Classification Scenes  For Great Britain, a grid of tiles based on a modified version of the Ordnance Survey 100 x 100 km tile  grid was created (Figure 4). In total, we classified 32 Classification Scenes comprising full coverage of  the GB land surface. Each Classification Scene was trained and classified independently. The  approximate 100 x 100 km tile size was chosen as this provides a manageable size for processing.  Moreover, if regions were much larger phenological variation due to climatic difference across a  Classification Scene could begin to degrade results. Some tiles such as those encompassing the  Western Isles, Orkney and Shetland, and Cornwall and the Scilly Isles are larger. These are intentionally  enlarged to avoid a sparsity of training data due to the extensive presence of sea in these tiles.  Occasionally where tile extents are modified to include specific areas overlap between adjacent tiles  do occur.  For Northern Ireland, because of its much smaller area, it was possible to use a single Classification  Scene determined by the minimum bounding rectangle of the Northern Ireland land mass (Figure 2).  The 40-band Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Image was combined with Northern Ireland Context  Rasters to produce a 49-band single Classification Scene. 12      Figure 4. Tiles used for selecting Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Images for Great Britain (red) and  Northern Ireland (blue).    The UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework  The UK Land Parcel Spatial Framework used for LCM2023 was originally developed for LCM2007  (Morton et. al., 2011) and a modified version was used for LCM2015. We have had to make some  minor changes since LCM2015. The land parcel geometries are unchanged, but we have re-ordered  database storage and defined new indices to enable faster processing. The consequence of this is that  the unique identifiers (the gid attribute) for each land parcel do not match those provided in the  LCM2015 Land Parcel dataset. For most users this will have no significance, but for users who wish to  compare the new land cover with LCM2015 using parcel identifiers, instead of spatial overlap, this will  not be immediately possible.    Land parcels in the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework have a minimum area of approximately 0.5  hectares, the MMU. The land parcels were derived by generalising national cartography (Morton et.  al., 2011; Smith et. al., 2007) and are designed to represent discrete real-world units of land such as  fields, parks, urban areas, woodlands, lakes and so forth. It is usual, but not universal, that the land  parcels are dominated by a single land cover type. Organising the 10 m Classified Pixels into land  parcels helps to reduce classification noise to provide a clean, easier to use product. It also provides a  convenient fixed structure for comparing land cover over time for change detection.    Bootstrap Training  Bootstrapping is used to refer to a self-starting process that proceeds without external input. UKCEH  have developed an automatic training process for land cover/habitat classification that does not 13    require a fresh collection of (expensive) field-gathered data for classifier training, and we have named  the process Bootstrap Training. Land cover and habitat change is usually gradual. Transitions from one  land cover or habitat to another typically occur over a number of years. Therefore recent habitat/land  cover maps can be a valuable source of training data for a new map if the original maps are accurate  and the update interval of the new map is short relative to target dynamics. When this is true, land  cover observations from the historic maps can be used to sample the current satellite image to  produce training observations. These can then be used by a RF classifier to yield a classification result,  which contributes to the bootstrap for the next map and so forth. Because the historic maps give wall- to-wall coverage they provide a very large number of training observations, which is the key to  learning success. Machine-learning algorithms, such as RF, rely on the majority signal to assign class  membership, so when the Bootstrap Training set is very large if a minor proportion have changed class  (are incorrect) over the refresh interval since these will have little influence on the dominant signal.  The Bootstrap Training dataset for UKCEH LCM2023 came from UKCEH LCM2020, LCM2021 and  LCM2022 classified pixel products. We filtered these land cover products retaining only pixels with  >80% probability and which were classified as the same land cover class across all three years. Figure  5 gives an example of a Bootstrap Training dataset and resulting classification result. Crop rotations  resulting in land cover change between arable and improved grassland classes within the preceding  three-year period, means that in some areas this method is less well suited to producing training data  for these classes. Consequently, training data for arable and improved grassland classes was instead  sourced from the UKCEH Land Cover® plus: Crops data for 2023.    Figure 5. UKCEH Land Cover classes (left), a Bootstrap Training set (centre) and the resultant RF land  cover classification (right).    Random Forest classification  Random Forest (RF) classification (Breiman 2001) is a supervised learning technique that uses a  training set of known observations to derive an empirical relationship which is then used to predict  the membership of unknown observations. Bootstrap Training pixels were placed into labelled bags  and from each bag 10,000 samples, with replacement were drawn to train the RF classifier. The RF  classifier subsequently yields the 10 m Classified Pixel product (for example, Figure 3, right). Sampling  with replacement ensures that all land cover classes have an equal number of pixel observations for  training the RF, this balances learning. Without balanced learning the signal of rarer classes will be  weak and susceptible to domination from commoner classes, causing misclassification. 14    The classification software used for UKCEH LCMs is bespoke and was developed by UKCEH scientific  staff. It integrates the Weka (Frank et. al. 2016) machine learning suite with a PostGIS geospatial  database and gdal tools (https://gdal.org/). These are all open source technologies.    Product validation  LCM2023 was validated using 33,107 validation reference points collected from across the UK and  covering all 21 LCM classes. The reference data is a composite data set, derived from the GB  countryside survey, open source National Forest Inventory data, Rural Payment Agency data and a set  of bespoke LCM validation points generated from manual image interpretation and field collection.  These were intersected with the UKCEH LCM 25 m rasterised polygon datasets to determine  correspondence. The overall accuracy of LCM2023 is 83% (Appendix 4).    Known Issues  A small number of polygons are missing from the vector land parcel products, with corresponding  areas of nodata in the derived 25 m rasterised land parcels dataset. This will have a negligible effect  on the 1 km summary raster data products. The 10 m classified pixels datasets are unaffected.    Citing LCM2023  Each LCM2023 dataset is assigned a DOI and should be cited accordingly. DOIs and citations for the  respective datasets are provided in Table 5.

Notes on UKCEH Land Cover Classes   (see also Appendix 2 for a summary of UK BAP Broad Habitat definitions)  UKCEH Land  Cover Class  Notes  Broadleaved  woodland  In the UK BAP Broadleaved, mixed and yew woodland the broadleaved  woodlands are characterised by stands >5 m high with tree cover >20%. Scrub  (<5 m) requires a cover >30 % for inclusion. Such fine distinctions cannot be made  through remote sensing. Open-canopy woodland (stands with trees <50 %) is a  particular problem, albeit occurring relatively rarely. These are likely to be confused  with other classes due to the dominance of the non-woodland understory.   Broadleaved evergreen trees rarely occur in stands >0.5 hectares; an area large  enough to create suitable training areas appropriate for classification.  Consequently the classifier would struggle with this land cover. It is likely these  stands will be classified as Conifer because of the full-year chlorophyll signal.  Mixed woodland stands of broad-leaved or evergreen trees exceeded the minimum  mappable unit, they were treated as separate blocks within the woodland; in many  parts of the UK, truly ‘mixed woodlands’ as opposed to those with mosaic-blocks of  broadleaved and coniferous trees, are unusual.   Stands with near-closed canopies can be interpreted easily in the field and pure  examples can normally be found for training the classifier.   Coniferous  woodland  The UK BAP Coniferous Woodland class includes semi-natural stands and  plantations, with cover >20 %. Classification of coniferous woodland is generally  straightforward, but rare examples of open canopy semi-natural pinewoods are  likely to be classified according to the dominant understorey class.   The UK BAP includes new plantation and recently felled areas. These are land use,  not land cover. Newly felled areas are often dominated by grass, heather and  encroaching vegetation and more likely to be classified as these, instead of  coniferous woodland.  Deciduous larch has potential for confusion with broadleaved deciduous woodland  but is generally correctly identified.  Arable and  Horticulture  The BAP Broad Habitat Arable and Horticulture includes annual crops, perennial  crops such as berries and orchards and freshly ploughed land. This is a very broad  class and as a consequence has large potential for spectral confusion with non- arable surfaces. The main confusion between arable and other classes occurs  between arable land and improved grassland. This is especially likely when  grassland is managed by cutting, followed by periods of low growth and reflectance  from chlorophyll. When this happens the observed seasonal reflectance pattern  can be similar to graminid crops, such as wheat and barley. Indeed grass managed  in this way is technically a crop, so an arable classification is not necessarily wrong. 18    Improved  Grassland  Improved grassland is distinguished from semi-natural grasslands based on its  higher productivity, lack of winter senescence, location and/or context. Grasslands  lie on a continuum, so some confusion with other grassland types is inevitable.  Confusion with grass-like crops will also occur.  Neutral Grassland    The UK BAP Broad Habitat Neutral Grassland is expected to be challenging for  satellite-based classification. BAP Neutral Grassland is defined by botanical  composition and includes semi-improved grasslands managed for silage, hay or  pasture (Jackson, 2000). There is not generally an obvious spectral difference  between these and other productive grass types. However, the inclusion of Context  Rasters for slope and distance to rivers appear to have helped greatly with Neutral  Grassland detection.    Calcareous  Grassland    Calcareous Grassland class is mapped spectrally. However, the inclusion of ancillary  layers for slope is expected to improve results. UKCEH does not have free access to  a highly resolved soil PH/soil type layer, which we would expect to help further. For  regions know to contain substantial coverage of Calcareous Grassland, for example  Limestone Dales of Derbyshire and North Yorkshire, the South Downs and Salisbury  Plain our results match expectations.   Acid Grassland  The UK BAP Acid Grassland can be spectrally variable, depending on dominant  species composition. Deciduous Acid grassland, dominated by Molinea caerula has  a distinct signal from acid grasslands dominated by mixtures other grasses, rushes,  mosses, herbs and sedges. In other work we have been able to refine this class  successfully. However, we did not make this separation in historical maps, so we  are not able to retrieve suitable observations from Bootstrap Training.  Bracken has a very distinctive spectral signal, but only at certain times of the year  when its foliage begins to dominate its grassland understory. Historically, with  restricted availability of satellite images we could not reliably separate the UK BAP  Bracken class from Acid Grassland so we combined these into a single UKCEH Land  Cover Class. With the greater image frequency and therefore better access to  seasonal signals it may now be possible to overcome this historic limitation, but to  do this we will need novel training data as we will not be able to retrieve a signal  from Bootstrap Training.  Heather; and  Heather grassland  For LCM2007 we refined the BAP Dwarf Shrub and Heath into two classes,  depending on the density of Heather, producing the UKCEH Heather and Heather  grassland classes (it is heather when there is greater than 25 % Heather cover). This  was to retain some consistency between the LCM1990 and LCM2000 classes Open  Shrub Heath and Dense Shrub Heath. In some parts of the UK, significant areas of  low-lying non-heather shrubs occur. For example, Gorse can form a dominant shrub  layer.   Note: the Land Cover Maps typically show confusion over Heather, Heather  grassland and Bog. However, they are often difficult to separate in the field.  It is 19    challenging to accurately estimate coverage above and below the defining  threshold.  Fen, Marsh and  Swamp  The UK BAP Fen, Marsh and Swamp includes fen, fen meadows, rush pasture,  swamp, flushes and springs. From a remote sensing perspective Fen, Marsh and  Swamp is problematic as it is can be comprised of a wide range of vegetation types  and many patches are below the MMU of the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial  Framework. The small size of many Fen, Marsh and Swamp patches, plus their  typically mosaic nature make it difficult to find reliable training data. Consequently,  Fen, Marsh and Swamp is likely to be underestimated in some regions. However,  substantial areas of contiguous reed dominated Fenland appear to be well  detected.  Bog  The UK BAP Bog includes ericaceous, herbaceous and mossy swards in areas with a  peat depth >0.5 m. We cannot detect peat depth from satellites.  Vegetation on deep peat soils represent a continuum involving acid grassland,  dwarf shrub heath and some types of fen, marsh and swamp and the separation of  continuously varying land cover into discrete types can be difficult, especially when  they exist in a complex small patch mosaic and their definitions are vague.   We retain the Bog class to maintain consistency with historical UKCEH LCM  products and the RF classifier learns Bog presence based on training data  automatically generated from these. The predicted distribution occurs in regions  where it is expected, so is a good indicator of where Bog is likely to be occurring.  However, Bog and the range of upland vegetation classes expected to occur on  peaty soils (Acid grassland, Fen marsh and swamp, Heather, and Heather grassland)  show a cluster of interclass confusion (Appendix 4). This is partly due fine-scale  variation but largely an effect of ambiguous definitions. UK BAP Broad Habitats (on  which UKCEH Land Cover Classes are based) were not defined with satellite remote  sensing in mind.  Saltwater  Saltwater is rarely different spectrally from freshwater, and the saltwater  distribution predicted by the RF classifier is determined by coastal Context Rasters  in Classification Scenes. There will be some confusion between Saltwater and  Freshwater in tidal rivers, but not substantial. Occasionally, Saltwater is confused  with non-vegetated surfaces close to the coast and this happens because the  automatically generated Saltwater training classes coincide with low-tide  conditions in the satellite view. The effect has so far been trivial but the result is  that we predict Saltwater with slightly lower accuracy than Freshwater. Our main  goal is to map land cover, so coastal water and intertidal regions are lower priority. 20    Freshwater      The UKCEH Freshwater class comes from merging two BAP BHs (Standing Open  Water and Canals, and Rivers and Streams) since they cannot be separated by  spectra. In many cases, small and/or narrow water bodies fall below the MMU of  the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework so effectively disappear into the  dominant surrounding vegetation. Where these features are appropriately aligned  and sufficiently wide, pixels they may be detected and if so will be available in the  Raster Classification datasets.  Water bodies >0.5 ha and wider than 40 m are mapped with very high accuracy.  The exceptions are temporary water bodies and quarries. Water in some quarries  is strongly affected by the minerals in the rock and can result in atypical colours and  misclassification.  Inland Rock  The BAP Broad Habitat Inland Rock covers both natural and artificial exposed rock  surfaces which are >0.25 ha, such as inland cliffs, caves, screes and limestone  pavements, as well as various forms of excavations and waste tips such as quarries  and quarry waste. Opportunistic vegetation is common amongst rocky landscapes.  We classify UKECH Inland Rock if rock has the dominant signature.  Urban; and  Suburban    Within the Built-up Areas and Gardens BAP Broad Habitat we can reliably separate  two UKCEH categories: Urban and Suburban. Urban includes dense urban, such as  town and city centres, where there is little, if any, vegetation. Urban also includes  areas such as dock sides, car parks and industrial estates. It is sometimes confused  with other non-vegetated surfaces; for example open cast quarries or more rarely  coastal rocks or ploughed fields.  Suburban includes suburban areas where the spectral signature is a mix of urban  and vegetation signatures. Suburban and Urban lie on a continuum and confusion  is expected.  Supralittoral Rock Features that may be present in this coastal class include vertical rock, boulders,  gullies, ledges and pools generally forming a narrow band when viewed from above.  Only limited areas can be mapped using satellite remote sensing.   Supralittoral  Sediment  This class includes sand dunes, which are reliably mapped. Areas of coastal sand  may be confused between this class and the littoral sediment class. Supralittoral  sediments can stabilise and from increasing volumes of vegetation. Heavily  vegetated littoral sediment is likely to be classified as a vegetation class.   Littoral Rock  These classes are those in the maritime zone on a rocky coastline. They are  generally more extensive than supralittoral rock and thus more readily detected  using satellite images. 21    Littoral Sediment;  and Saltmarsh      The BAP Broad Habitat Littoral Sediment has a subclass, the BAP Priority Habitat  Saltmarsh. Saltmarsh is generally distinct from nearby vegetation and only occurs  near the coast. As a consequence we can map this well with remote sensing. The  Saltmarsh class is occasionally subject to commission error, when we mistake other  vegetation in the coastal zone (mainly Arable) as Saltmarsh.   The Littoral Sediment is sometimes confused with the Supralittoral Sediment class. 22    Appendix 2. Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats   This appendix provides a brief summary of the JNCC definitions of the Broad Habitats and is based on  Jackson (2000). There is some duplication of material Appendix 2 with Appendix 1. However in  combination they provide users with key information to understand UKCEH Land Cover Classes and  the Broad Habitat definitions they are based on. Note: class numbers here are JNCC’s Broad Habitat  class numbers, not UKCEH Land Cover Class numbers.  The text in this Appendix has been copied from Morton et. al., 2011, with very minor updates to  remove obsolete cross-references to historical projects and documents, plus some corrections. Some  new comments are included regarding BAP Broad Habitat Linear Features and the new 20 m Classified  Pixel datasets.  1. Broadleaved, Mixed and Yew Woodland  This Broad Habitat is characterised by vegetation dominated by trees >5 m high when mature, with  tree cover >20 %. Scrub (<5 m) requires cover >30 % for inclusion in this Broad Habitat. It includes  stands of both native and non-native broadleaved trees and yew. Woodlands dominated by coniferous  species but with >20 % cover by deciduous species are included in this category. Areas of fen woodland  dominated by species such as willow (Salix spp.), alder (Alnus glutinosa) or birch (Betula spp.) are also  included.   2. Coniferous Woodland  This Broad Habitat is characterised by vegetation dominated by trees >5 m high when mature, which  forms a canopy having a cover of >20 %. ‘Coniferous Woodland’ includes semi-natural stands and  plantations and includes both native and non-native coniferous trees.   3. Boundaries and Linear Features  This Broad Habitat type covers a range of linearly arranged landscape features such as hedgerows,  lines of trees, walls, stone and earth banks, grass strips and dry ditches. These features are not  included as a UKCEH Land Cover Class as they are generally too narrow to be reliably captured from  the satellite images. However, linear features are of general interest and an important component of  the landscape. Some linear features will be visible in the 10 m Classified Pixel dataset.   However, regardless of whether or not we can see linear features, we cannot classify them using our  current methods. Linear features are in fact just thin fragments of land cover types that we already  map. Membership in this class is defined by shape, not spectra. We do not have tools for classifying  shapes. New tools for line-finding within the 10 m Classified Pixels products could help with their  detection.   4. Arable and Horticulture  This Broad Habitat includes annual crops, perennial crops, woody crops, intensively managed  commercial orchards, commercial horticultural land (such as nurseries, commercial vegetable plots  and commercial flower growing areas), freshly-ploughed land, annual leys, rotational set-aside and  fallow.  5. Improved Grassland  ‘Improved Grassland’ is characterised by vegetation dominated by a few fast-growing grasses such as  Lolium spp., and also white clover (Trifolium repens), on fertile, neutral soils. Improved grasslands are 23    typically either managed as pasture, or mown regularly for silage production or in non-agricultural  contexts for recreation and amenity purposes.  6. Neutral Grassland  This Broad Habitat type is characterised by vegetation dominated by grasses and herbs on a range of  neutral soils usually with a pH of between 4.5 and 6.5. It includes enclosed dry hay meadows and  pastures, together with a range of grasslands which are periodically inundated with water or  permanently moist.  7. Calcareous Grassland  Calcareous Grassland is characterised by vegetation dominated by grasses and herbs on shallow, well- drained soils which are rich in bases (principally calcium carbonate) formed by the weathering of chalk  and other types of limestone or base-rich rock. Soil pH tends to be high (>6) although it may be as low  as 5.  8. Acid Grassland  Acid Grassland is characterised by vegetation dominated by grasses and herbs on a range of lime- deficient soils, which have been derived from acidic bedrock or from superficial deposits such as sands  and gravels. Such soils usually have a low base status, with a pH of <5.5.   9. Bracken   This Broad Habitat type covers areas dominated by a continuous canopy cover of bracken (Pteridium  aquilinum) at the height of the growing season. It does not include areas with scattered patches of  bracken or areas of bracken, which are less than 0.25 ha. These are included in the Broad Habitat type  with which they are associated.   10. Dwarf Shrub Heath  ‘Dwarf Shrub Heath’ is characterised by vegetation that has >25 % cover of plant species from the  heath family (ericoids) or dwarf gorse Ulex minor. It generally occurs on well-drained, nutrient-poor,  acid soils. This habitat type does not include dwarf shrub dominated vegetation in which species  characteristic of peat-forming vegetation such as cotton grass Eriophorum spp. and peat-building  sphagna are abundant, or that occurs on deep peat (>0.5 m) as these are included in the 'Bog' Broad  Habitat type.   11. Fen, Marsh and Swamp  This habitat includes fen, flushes, springs, fen meadows, rush pasture and swamp. Fens are peatlands  that receive water and nutrients from groundwater and surface runoff, as well as from rainfall. Flushes  are associated with lateral water movement, and springs with localised upwelling of water. Marsh is  a general term usually used to imply waterlogged soil; it is used more specifically here to refer to fen  meadows and rush-pasture communities on mineral soils and shallow peats. Swamps are  characterised by tall emergent vegetation. Reedbeds (i.e. swamps dominated by stands of common  reed Phragmites australis) are also included in this type. Apart from rush pasture, examples of this  Broad Habitat are relatively rare.  12. Bog   This Broad Habitat type covers wetlands that support vegetation that is usually peat-forming and  which receive mineral nutrients principally from precipitation rather than ground water. This is 24    referred to as ombrotrophic (rain-fed) mire. The Bog Broad Habitat includes ericaceous, herbaceous  and mossy swards in areas with a peat depth >0.5 m.  13. Standing Open Water and Canals  This Broad Habitat type includes natural systems such as lakes, meres and pools, as well as manmade  waters such as reservoirs, canals, ponds and gravel pits.  14. Rivers and Streams   The 'Rivers and Streams' Broad Habitat type covers rivers and streams from bank top to bank top, or  where there are no distinctive banks or banks are never overtopped, it includes the extent of the mean  annual flood.  15. Montane  The ‘Montane Habitats’ category includes a range of vegetation types that occur exclusively in the  montane zone such as prostrate dwarf shrub heath, snow-bed communities, sedge and rush heaths,  and moss heaths. The distinction between the sub-montane and montane zone is often blurred and  the two usually merge through a band of transitional vegetation.  16. Inland Rock  This Broad Habitat type covers both natural and artificial exposed rock surfaces which are >0.25 ha,  such as inland cliffs, caves, screes and limestone pavements, as well as various forms of excavations  and waste tips such as quarries and quarry waste.  17. Built-Up Areas and Gardens  This Broad Habitat type covers urban and rural settlements, farm buildings, caravan parks and other  manmade built structures such as industrial estates, retail parks, waste and derelict ground, urban  parkland and urban transport infrastructure. It also includes domestic gardens and allotments. This  type does not include amenity grassland, which should be included in the 'Improved Grassland'  category.  18. Supralittoral Rock  This habitat occurs above the high water mark, in areas influenced by wave splash and sea spray.  Features that may be present include vertical rock, boulders, gullies, ledges and pools, depending on  the wave exposure of the site and its geology.  19. Supralittoral Sediment  This habitat occurs above the high water mark, but in areas influenced by wave splash and sea-spray.  It includes shingle beaches, sand dunes and machair.  20. Littoral Rock  The geology and wave exposure of the shore influence the form of Littoral Rock habitats, which can  be as varied as vertical rock, shore platforms, boulder shores, or rocky reefs surrounded by areas of  sediment. In general, Littoral Rock tends to be colonised by algae in wave-sheltered conditions, and  by limpets, barnacles and mussels as wave-exposure increases. 25    21. Littoral Sediment  Areas of Littoral Sediment are widespread around the UK forming features such as beaches, sand  banks, and intertidal mudflats. A large proportion of this habitat occurs in estuaries and inlets where  it can cover extensive areas. Saltmarsh is included within this Broad Habitat.  22. Inshore Sublittoral Sediment  All areas of sea and estuary class are assumed to be Inshore Sublittoral Sediment. It is defined as within  six nautical miles of the shoreline by JNCC. 26    Appendix 3.

INTRODUCTION    The NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme is centred upon the intensive study  of a large field experiment located at the Macaulay Land Use Research Institute’s  farm at Sourhope in the Scottish Borders. A full description of the site, the rationale  for the main field experiment and experimental design, methods and management can  be found in the Baseline Data Survey dated November 1998.    At the outset of the experiment, a broad scale of monitoring was prescribed in order to  provide research groups with a general context in which to view their more detailed  studies. The presentation of a large number of figures and tables closely follows the  procedure adopted in Report II, with the twin aims of enabling groups to more easily  recognise links with their own data as well as facilitating comparisons between years.  The types and dates of measurements are listed in Table 1.     Management of the site was impacted by two unrelated events in 2001:    a) Use of the Sourhope field site was affected by the imposition of Government  restrictions following the outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) in the UK  during February 2001 (Table 2). No visitors were allowed to visit the site between  February and the end of May. During this period work was undertaken by the  Officer(s) in Charge on behalf of research groups in accordance with an agreed  timetable. Thereafter researchers were able to resume their own sampling subject to  their visits complying with a protocol laid out by the Macaulay Land Use Research  Institute vet in Aberdeen and strictly monitored by the Officer in Charge at Sourhope.    Key management activities on the Site were relatively unaffected by FMD. As a result  liming, nitrogen application, pH measurements, biomass collections, vegetation  cutting and Point Analysis were undertaken in accordance with the agreed 2001 Site  Management Plan. Although the first biocide application in May was missed, the  following four applications were successfully completed. 4 b) The officer in charge at the site changed, following the departure of Sarah  Buckland in May 2001.    2. RESULTS    2.1 Automatic Weather Station. 2001 headline weather data collected from the site  were generally unremarkable (Table 3). Following the previous particularly wet year,  rainfall was close to the long term annual average. Total annual radiation showed little  change, whilst average temperatures were slightly reduced and average soil moisture  content was somewhat raised compared to previous years    2.2 Above-ground biomass. Amongst the treatments there was a consistent hierarchy  of biomass estimates throughout the sampling period and all treatments yielded peak  biomass production in July or August (Fig 1). It is, however, noteworthy that there  was a substantial increase in biomass estimates in 2001 compared to the previous  years (Fig 2a). It is suggested that this is likely to result from a combination of a  change in personnel and the switch from manual cutting to the use of mechanical  shears in 2001. All treatment measures were therefore normalised against C1 in each  year (Fig 2b) to identify a continuation of the positive impact upon productivity of  nitrogen and, to a lesser extent, lime. As in the previous year, the most effective  promotion of above-ground biomass was apparent in the nitrogen plus lime treatment.    In separate analyses biomass dry weights were ln-transformed before performing   ANOVA’s which reveal significant differences (Table 4) between improved (N and/or  L added) and non-improved plots, a significant interaction between treatment and year  (Table 5) but no significant differences between blocks (F=0.76, df=4,115, p>0.05).    2.3 Soil pH. Soil samples collected from the upper 5cm of the soil profile show that  the addition of lime has continued to raise soil pH to an average, in October 2001, of  6.19 in the limed plots and 6.38 in the N&L plots, whilst the addition of nitrogen  alone has also raised soil pH albeit it to a lesser extent (Fig 3). Mean soil pH in the  control plots has not changed significantly since the baseline measures were collected  in August 1998. 5 2.4 Botanical composition. The protocol for the Point Analysis survey in July 2001  mirrored that used in July 2000 and, on each occasion, Sarah Buckland was one of the  two surveyors who were each responsible for approximately 50% of the total number  of quadrats surveyed. There was no statistically significant difference between the  results recorded by each surveyor in 2001 (Genstat 5, General blocked ANOVA  F=1.90; df = 2, 1, 26; p = 0.18NS). It is perhaps of some significance, therefore, that  the total number of hits in the 2001 survey was 58% higher than the total number of  hits in the 2000 survey and this is apparent across all treatments. This suggests that  the sward is becoming more dense perhaps resulting from the removal of grazing  stock in 1998.    There were clear treatment differences in the most frequently encountered species in  2001 (Fig 4). Although the identities of these species did not vary significantly when  compared to the same treatments in the previous year, absolute values of relative  abundance, measured as the number of “hits” per species as a percentage of the total  number of “hits” within each treatment, revealed a number of large changes between  2001 and 2000 (Table 6). In particular Agrostis capillaris, which was the most  frequently encountered species in every treatemnt in 2000, showed a decline across all  treatments in 2001 with the result that it only remained the most abundant species in  the Control 1 and Limed plots. In contract both Festuca species (ovina and rubra)  increased across all treatments and were most frequently encountered within the  Nitrogen and Biocide (Festuca ovina) and Nitrogen & Lime (Festuca rubra) plots.  Species associated with improved grassland (Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis) were  most apparent in the fertilised plots (particularly those treated with both Nitrogen and  Lime) whilst species associated with less fertile pastures, such as Anthoxanthum  odoratum and Nardus stricta were more apparent within the untreated Control plots  (Fig 4).    A total of 24 separate species were identified in each of the unimproved treatments  (Control and Biocide) whilst only 18 separate species were found within the Nitrogen  & Lime plots suggesting that plant diversity may be starting to decline within the  most improved plots (Table 6). 6 The Point Analysis data have been subjected to Principal Components Analysis (PCA,  Genstat 5) (Fig 5) in order to examine the degree of association between samples.  There is no statistical weighting applied to the less common species as the intention is  to focus on any broad shifts among the dominant species. The analysis largely  separates those plots treated with nitrogen and/or lime from the control and biocide  plots. The vegetation within these latter unimproved plots tends to be rather more  uniform and is associated, in particular, with the presence of Agrostis vinealis,  Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus (and other bryophytes), Nardus stricta and Anthoxanthum  odoratum. The improved plots (ie those treated with Nitrogen and/or Lime) often  account for the most extreme points (Fig 5a) and an increase in the frequency of  contact with Festuca rubra within the limed plots is particularly apparent. Species  closely aligned with F. rubra include Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis and Holcus mollis.    Further evidence for the direction of change initiated by the main plot treatments can  be seen when the number of hits per plot for the major vegetation species are  correlated against estimates of the above-ground biomass obtained for each plot  during the summer 2001 cuts (Fig 6). The relative abundance of Festuca rubra and  Poa pratensis are positively correlated with biomass, whilst Anthoxanthum odoratum,  Nardus stricta, Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus (plus other bryophytes) and Agrostis  vinealis decline in relative abundance as biomass increases. There is a significant  increase in the frequency with which litter is encountered in those plots treated with  nitrogen and/or lime, reflecting a faster rate of vegetation turnover as soil fertility  increases.    3. SITE HETEROGENEITY    3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition. It was noted in the  year 2000 report that columns E and F, on the right-hand side of the site facing up the  slope, contained more acidic plots than columns on the left-hand side of the slope.  Although this effect is probably exaggerated  by the fact that 60% of the plots in these  columns are either Controls or treated with Biocide, there is support for an underlying  spatial heterogeneity across the experimental site in the comparatively low pH  measures recorded within the Nitrogen and/or Lime improved plots in theses columns  (Fig 7). 7   3.2 Variation in vegetation Biomass. Total biomass values for each plot are shown in  Fig 8. In 2001 outlying plots contain the lowest biomass within all treatments (Control  1 plot 5A; Control 2 plot 1D; Nitrogen plot 2A; Lime plot 5B; Nitrogen and Lime plot  1A; Biocide plot 1E). This is mirrored for the cumulative biomass (1999 to 2001) for  all treatments except Nitrogen. Conversely the highest biomass levels are generally  found within plots which are more centrally located on the site (eg Nitrogen and Lime  plot 2E; Lime plot 2C; Biocide plot 2D and Control 1 plot 2B).    There is a strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass (Fig 9) but  no significant difference in biomass sampled between blocks (Genstat 5, ANOVA  F=0.69,df=5,4,20,p= 0.61NS – see Appendix 1 for values).    ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  I would like to thank Sarah Buckland for her help following my appointment as  Officer in Charge at Sourhope and her assistance during the summer 2001 Point  Analysis Survey. I am also grateful for the support of MLURI farm staff at Sourhope,  Richard Scott, Mandy Lane, Peter Millard and fellow members of the Soil  Biodiversity Programme. 8 Table 1 Data collection on the main Soil Biodiversity field experiment at  Sourhope    • Soil pH      9th March 2001 & 16th October 2001    40ml of de-ionized water was mixed into c.25g soil (0-5cm deep) and allowed  to stand for 20 minutes before measurement. One sample was taken from the  centre of each plot.    • Above-ground productivity  5th – 18th May (*)  4th – 8th Jun   3rd – 18th Jul (*)  6th – 14th Aug   4th – 11th Sep  (*) includes periods where mower unavailable due to mechanical breakdown    A Kubota riding grass mower was used at 3 weekly intervals during the  summer to cut vegetation on the site to c.6cm. Prior to each mow, random  0.5m2 quadrats in each of sub-plots S, T, U & V were located on each plot and  cut to c.6cm, using hand-held mechanical grass shears. The clippings were  collected, oven-dried at 800C and subsequently weighed.    • Botanical surveys    16th July to 3rd August  The same 0.5m2 cell within each of S, T, U & V sub-plots of each plot was  allocated for use in a full botanical survey. A Point Quadrat frame, containing  a grid of 100 5cm x 5cm cells, was placed over the cell. Large “pins” were  then dropped into 25 of these smaller cells and a record made of each occasion  a species was touched by the pin down the vegetation profile.    14th to 17th August  Small-scale relative cover vegetation survey around minirhizotron tubes in  Control 1, Biocide, and Nitrogen & Lime plots (on behalf of Project 2113 –  Macaulay Institute).    22nd to 24th August  Relative cover vegetation survey within disturbance/nutrient addition matrix in  sub-plot Y of Control 1 plots (on behalf of Project 2133 – Lancaster  University).      • Weather data    An Automatic Weather Station is located on the site. This was regularly  downloaded and transmitted to the Soil Biodiversity Data Manager at CEH,  Merlewood. 9 Table 2 Schedule of site activity 1998 to 2001          1998  1999  2000  2001  Soil sampling  2  63  68  31  Measurement  1  13  33  12  Experimental set  up/input    0    9    15    4    Other    0    5    12    9    Total    3    90    128    56 10 Table 3 Soil Biodiversity Site Automatic Weather Station – headline measures  1999 to 2001        Total  rainfall  (mm)  Total  radiation  (MJ m-2 )  Avge soil  moisture  content     (m3 m-3)  Avge air  temp 2m  (0C)  Avge air  temp 2cm  (0C)  Avge   soil temp  0C -2cm Avge       soil temp   0C -5cm  Avge   soil temp  0C -10cm Avge      soil temp  0C -20cm 1999 845  3439  0.30  8.17  8.33  8.65  8.64  8.65  8.57  2000 1209  3472  0.35  7.47  8.00  8.12  8.08  8.07  8.04  2001 839  3473  0.37  7.28  7.66  7.72  7.67  7.66  7.62 11 Table 4 Results of split plot ANOVA (Genstat 5) examining the effect of  Treatment on shoot biomass harvested over the summer in (a) 1999, (b) 2000 and  (c) 2001. Estimates of shoot biomass were made at each of the five mowing  occasions conducted during each summer, when vegetation was collected from  random 0.5m2 cells in each of S, T, U & V sub-plots in each plot. Dried weights  were summed, to give a total annual biomass, and then ln-transformed for the  purpose of these analyses.

Introduction    The Sourhope Field Experiment Site at Rigg Foot, Sourhope has been designated as the focus  of intensive, co-ordinated research under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Programme. A  sampling protocol is necessary to co-ordinate operations and to support integration of the  individual projects. This protocol describes the layout of the experimental design and the  procedures which should be followed when sampling, setting up experiments or taking  measurements from the site.      2. Experimental Design    2.1 The Field Site and Layout of Sampling Areas    The designated site is situated on the north-facing slope of Rigg Foot, at the Macaulay Land  Use Research Institute's research station at Sourhope. The Rigg Foot site lies at around 309m  above sea level, varying in slope from 8o at the upper end to 4o towards the lower reaches.  The site is dominated by brown forest soils of the Sourhope and Bellshill series with some  gleying on the lower slopes. The soils are developed in materials derived from andesite and  other intermediate igneous rocks. The vegetation is predominately the National Vegetation  Clasification (NVC) community U4d: Festuca ovina - Agrostos capillaris - Galium saxatile  grassland, Luzula multiflora-Rhytidiadelphus loreus subcommunity. A high fence bounds the  site to exclude grazing.     The combination of treatments and experiments required for the programme has led to the  experimental design shown in Appendix I.    The sampling area consists of 5 rows or 'Blocks', labelled 1-5, each having 6 'Main-plots',  labelled A-F. Six different treatments (see 2.2 below) have been allocated randomly to the  Main-plots within each Block. The Main-plots are each 20m x 12m in size and are separated  by guard areas to allow movement around the site with minimal disruption to the sampling  areas and to provide a buffer between the different types of treatments. The Main-plots are  marked with strings between skewers in their 4 corners and labelled at the bottom left corner  (north-east).     Each Main-plot is sub-divided into 10 Sub-plots (labelled P-Y), as shown in Appendix II.  Sub-plots are themselves separated by narrow guard areas to give some distance between the  different sub-plot treatments (see 2.2 below) and to provide a region for moving around the  plot to minimise disturbance on the sampling areas. As the guard areas will receive the Main- plot treatment, these regions should also be used for filling in areas in the sub-plots where  Soil  Biodiversity  NERC Thematic Programme destructive sampling has taken place. The Sub-plots are marked with skewers in their 4  corners and labelled at the bottom left corner (north-east).     Each Main-plot is gridded into Cells, each 0.5m x 0.5m, to form the basis for all  sampling/recording. These cells have been designated as the minimum spatial unit by which  samples will be referenced in the Soil Biodiversity database, with the combination of  Block/Main-plot/Sub-plot/Cell providing the full spatial referencing system for the field site.  All sampling/recording should be tied to specific Cells referenced by their X and Y co- ordinates from the origin at the bottom-left corner of the Main-plot (see diagram in Appendix  II). These cells will not be specifically marked on the site, but should be located by  measuring within the subplots from the bottom-left corner.       2.2 Treatments    There are 6 main treatments (4 applied treatments and 2 controls) which are allocated  randomly to the Main-plots within each Block (see in Appendix I):    •  Liming  •  Nitrogen  •  Nitrogen & Liming  •  Biocide  •  Control 1   •  Control 2    To accommodate the requirement for special treatments to be applied on top of and in  addition to the 6 Main-plot treatments, sub-plots P,Q,R,W,X and Y will receive treatments or  have designations which vary according to which Main-plot treatment they receive. Sub-plots  S,T U and V will not receive additional treatments so that they can be used for general  sampling of Main-plot treatments. Sub-plot treatments are as follows:    •  13C   •  Destructive sampling   •  13C and Anoxia   •  Sewage sludge   •  Pesticide   •  Metal  •  Plough and re-seed  •  Fallow    Appendix II shows how these Sub-plot treatments are combined with and allocated across  Main-plot treatments.    Cutting:  Mowing will be carried out every three weeks during the growing season. The access paths  will be cut to approximately 3 cm whilst the main-plot areas will be cut to 6 cm, level ground  permitting. All cuttings will be removed from the whole site. 3. Sampling and Recording    3.1 Strategies and recommendations    All sampling and recording at the Sourhope site should be located in relation to specific  Cells, selected either randomly or with reference to pre-established patterns of site  heterogeneity. Once sampled, any individual cell will normally only be available for future  sampling by the same research team or others working in collaboration. Where several  samples may be taken from within a cell over time, a record must be kept by the research  team of the exact locations to ensure no point is re-sampled. Any permanent markers used  should be flush with the ground surface to allow for mowing; special arrangements will need  to be made for anything taller. Investigators are encouraged to use the four central Sub-plots  S-V as within-main-plot replicates in order to be able to establish the significance of within- main-plot variation. Samples should normally be made over a depth of 0-10, 0-5 or 5-10cm,  or by horizon. Where horizon is used the depth ranges must also be recorded. Any sampling  over other depth ranges should be made against specific scientific criteria. Depths should be  measured relative to the ground surface (upper surface of the soil litter layer) i.e. 0 = ground  surface.    With many different projects and researchers involved in the Programme, there is a need to  ensure a co-ordinated approach to sampling and a standardised method of recording, to allow  cross-referencing of samples and data wherever possible, and to minimise damage. Standard  referencing and coding systems have been devised and built into the Site Visit Record Sheets  (see Appendix IV); these forms should be used to record any sampling, experimental or  measurement activity on site.     3.2 Sample Identification and Labelling    All soil samples will be referenced to the original 'Sampling Unit' from which they were  extracted at the field site. The term 'Sampling Unit' refers to the unit of soil sampled in  relation to its 2-dimensional position on the ground surface, at a given point in time. It may  refer to an individual core, auger sample, turf, monolith, pit or any other distinct block/unit of  soil sampled. A unique ‘Sampling Unit Identifier’ (SUID) will be allocated by the Sourhope  Field Experiment Manager to each Sampling Unit. To this SUID will be attached the spatial  reference (Block/Main-Plot/Sub-Plot/Cell), the sampling date, Project Code, Sampling Unit  type (core, auger sampling, etc.) and Sampling Unit dimensions. The SUID thus provides a  means by which samples and their associated data can be related to the original sampling  activity at the field site and cross-referenced across projects.    In most cases, the SUID will also relate to the original physical soil sample as extracted from  the ground and taken away (e.g. a complete core). However, in some cases, for example a soil  pit, it may be that only sub-samples by depth band or horizon are physically taken away, and  the SUID will relate to the whole pit.    Complete samples extracted from the whole Sampling Unit (e.g. a complete core) can use the  SUID as their unique identifier. Because of the infinite possibilities for generating derived  samples from the original Sampling Unit, for example taking sub-samples by depth/horizon  or bulked samples from several Sampling Units, additional systems for identifying and  labelling sub or super-samples will need to be devised and handled by each project team,  tailored to their own needs. However, it is most important that the SUID should 'track' samples throughout analyses and archiving, and be spawned through any derived samples,  however, wherever and whenever it takes place. Derived samples should be given identifiers  which either include or are accompanied by the original SUID, and which enable the  derivation of the sample from the original Sampling Unit to be traced. For example, for  simple splitting of the original Sampling Unit, a suffix sub-sample code might be attached to  the SUID, e.g.101-A, where 101 is the SUID; sub-samples by depth band might use a digit  (1,2,3) and sub-samples by horizon might use an alphabetic character (A,B,C). Projects  planning more complicated regimes of splitting/bulking will need to devise more  sophisticated systems. Whatever system is devised should also be used within project  datasets/databases and accompany sample data and meta-data sent in to the Soil Biodiversity  database at ITE Merlewood. Sub-samples by horizon must also be accompanied by details of  the horizon depth ranges.    Soil samples should be stored in clearly marked polythene bags placed inside a second,  similar bag. The outer bag should carry the SUID written with a permanent marker. A label  should be placed on the inner bag, carrying at least the following information in permanent  ink:      SUID    Derived sample ID (if applicable)    Project Code (of 'lead' project)  Spatial Reference (Block/Main-Plot/Sub-Plot/Cell X&Y)    Sampling Date      3.3 Sample Archiving     Vouchers of all soil samples should be archived at the time of collection. Temporary storage  is available in a -20oC freezer at Sourhope; long-term storage at -80o will be available at ITE  Merlewood.     3.4 Experimental Set-ups/Inputs     The installation of experimental set-ups (permanent or semi-permanent apparatus), for  example rhizotrons or litter bags, or the input of materials into the ground for example  injection of gas or introduction of worms into the soil needs to be recorded. Each  experimental set-up or input at a particular place should be assigned an ID by the project  team responsible, which will uniquely identify it within that project. Measurements taken  from the same set-up at a later date should relate to this ID.     3.5 Measurement/Recording    Measurements taken the field site may relate to particular point locations, for example soil  moisture recording sites, or delimited regions, for example vegetation quadrats. Each  measurement or recording location, i.e. point or region on the ground surface at which  measurements take place, should be assigned an ID by the project team responsible which  will uniquely identify it within that project. Where measurements relate to an experimental  set-up, then the ID of the experimental set-up should be used, or incorporated within the  measurement location ID to enable a link to be made. Where more than one project takes  measurements from the same set-up or measurement location (e.g. vegetation plot or soil  condition monitoring point), then those projects should reference the same ID. 4. Site Visit Procedure    All sampling and recording carried out at the Sourhope field experiment site will be  authorised and co-ordinated by the Field Experiment Manager. The following procedure  should be adopted by all investigators planning to visit the site for sampling, experimental or  measurement purposes:    4.1 Pre- Site Visit: Visit Registration Form    Prior to visiting the field experiment site, researchers must complete a Visit Registration  Form to outline their visit plans and experimental requirements (see Appendix III). This  information is essential for the Sourhope Field Experiment Manager to ensure that  investigators' requirements can be met, sampling/experimental areas allocated, visits co- ordinated to prevent damage, and any potential for joint sampling identified. The form can be  found on the Soil Biodiversity Webpages (www.nmw.ac.uk/soilbio). On completion of the form,  pressing the 'Submit' button will automatically email the information to the Sourhope Field  Experiment Manager (Sarah Buckland) and send a copy to the Programme Manager (Richard  Scott). The Field Experiment Manager will respond to confirm visit plans or to discuss  possible alternative arrangements. Any potential for the sharing of samples between groups  which have not already been identified may also be discussed at this stage. Investigators  should wait for authorisation before visiting the site.    4.2 Site Visit : Site Visit Record Sheets    All visitors to Sourhope must first report to the Field Experiment Manager before proceeding  to the field site. The Field Experiment Manager will confirm or allocate exact locations for  sampling, recording or experimentation within the plots, provide the appropriate Site Visit  Record Sheets and allocate Sampling Unit IDs (SUID). Visitors should complete these sheets  whilst on site, recording exactly what they have done where (see Appendix IV). This  information is essential in order to log and cross-reference the type, location and purpose of  sampling/experimentation at the site within the Soil Biodiversity database, so that baseline  data and project datasets can eventually be integrated (see section 4.3 below).    The completed Site Visit Recording Sheets should be left with the Field Experiment  Manager, who will forward a copy to the Asst. Data Manager (Deirdre Caffrey) for  incorporation within the Soil Biodiversity database. Investigators should make their own  copy at Sourhope (photocopying facilities are available) to ensure that the standard  referencing system and SUIDs supplied and attached to samples are referenced within their  own datasets/databases.    4.3 Post Site Visit:  Data Handling    The Soil Biodiversity database at ITE Merlewood will hold baseline data for the field site,  details of project activities (sampling, experiments, measurements) derived from the  information supplied on the Site Visit Record Sheets, and eventually the actual project data.  The SUIDs, experimental set-up IDs and measurement location IDs, together with the spatial  reference coding system (Block/Main-plot/Sub-plot and Cell), form the basis for the eventual  linking of samples, data and meta-data on field activities and cross-project research  concerned with the Sourhope site.  It is most important that these IDs and the spatial  referencing system are maintained throughout individual project datasets/databases in order to enable this linking of project datasets to take place within the Programme database. In  particular, the SUID must accompany any sample extracted or derived from that original  Sampling Unit, and any analytical/experimental results generated from it. Details of any sub- sampling or bulking of samples and the system adopted for identifying such derived samples  and their data should be sent to the Assistant Data Manager at ITE Merlewood as soon as this  is known. Project teams are encouraged to contact the Data Managers (see below) at ITE  Merlewood for any advice and guidance they might require on the allocation of unique IDs  and managing project datasets.    5.

This information will be used by the Site Manager for  planning purposes and will also be fed into the Soil Biodiversity Database.    Four types of ‘Site Visit Record Sheets’ have been drawn up to capture this information and  are entitled:-     •  Project/Purpose (P)  •  Soil Sampling Details (S)  •  Experimental Set-up/ Input Details (E)  •  Measurement Details (M)    For each visit, a Project/Purpose sheet should be completed. The number and type of other  record sheets to be completed will depend on the nature of the visit and the number of main  plots visited.       Example completed record sheets are included in this document, following some explanatory  notes (which are referenced in the record sheets using superscript numbers).  The record sheet  templates themselves can be downloaded via a separate accompanying link on the website,  for use in the field.  Notes on completing the Site Visit Record Sheets    Project/Purpose    1. Project Code(s): If the purpose of visit is relevant to more than one project, then all  project codes should be given. The first listed will be taken as the lead project.      2. Visitor Name: Only one nominated person’s name need be given, ideally the person with  overall responsibility during the visit.      Soil Sampling Details    3. Sampling Unit: The term 'Sampling Unit' refers to the unit of soil to be sampled in  relation to its position on the ground surface. It may refer to an individual core, auger sample,  turf, monolith, pit or any other distinct block/unit of soil which is used for sampling. In most  cases the Sampling Unit will relate to an original physical soil sample as it is extracted from  the ground. In the case of soil pits however the Sampling Unit will be the pit as a whole, and  the individual samples taken from within that pit will be recorded as sub-samples from that  unit.     4. Diagram Label: Each Sampling Unit should be marked on the plot diagram and given a  label by which it is then referenced in the table. A cross should be placed in the cell  containing the Sampling Unit(s), and the cell reference numbers (in x and y) given in the  table.     Where there is more than one distinct sampling unit in a cell, give a different reference label  for each. Where the Sampling Unit is an area which covers more than one cell (e.g. a 1m2 turf  removal), it should be given a single reference label, and all the cells it occupies should be  marked on the diagram and listed in the table.    If there is a particular need to spatially reference Sampling Units at a finer resolution than the  cell within the database (e.g. for analysis of within-cell spatial variation), please attach to the  record sheet more precise dimensions along with a sampling frame description.    5.  Sampling Unit ID (SUID): A unique ID will be allocated to each individual Sampling  Unit extracted or dug at the site and this will be supplied by the Sourhope Site Manager  during the visit. The SUID should be listed in the table on the record sheet along with the  other details requested for each Sampling Unit. It should be retained with any samples  derived from the sampling unit through splitting or bulking, for cross-referencing and linking  into the Soil Biodiversity database.    6.  Depth Range: The depth range given should be relative to the ground surface. Experimental Set-up/Input Details    7.  Experimental Set-up: This term refers to any permanent or semi-permanent apparatus for  experimentation installed at a particular place (e.g. rhizotron, litter bag) or the input of any  substance to the ground (e.g. injection of gas to soil, introduction of worms).    8.  Diagram Label: Each experimental set-up or input carried out should be marked on the  plot diagram and given a label by which it is then referenced in the table. A cross should be  placed in all the affected cells, and the cell reference numbers (in x and y) given in the table.    9. Experime ntal Set-up ID: An ID should be allocated which will uniquely identify each  experimental set-up or input at a particular place. These IDs should be devised by the project  team. Measurements taken from the same set-up at a later date should relate to this ID.     10. Experiment Type: This should be a brief description of the set-up/input e.g. litter bag  placement, rhizotrons inserted, gas injected, worms introduced.     11. Experiment Removal Date: If apparatus, for example, is set up and is later going to be  removed, it is necessary to record the dates during which it was in place. The planned  removal date should be given at time of set-up, and the actual removal date should be  recorded on the same sheet when it is removed.       Measurement Details    12. Measurement Location: The measurement location is the region or point on the ground  surface from which measurements are taken.     13. Diagram Label: Each measurement location should be given a label on the plot diagram  by which it is then referenced in the table on the record sheet. A cross should be placed in all  the affected cells, and the cell references (in x and y) given in the table.    14. Measurement Location ID: An ID should be allocated to uniquely identify each location  (region or point) on the ground surface from which measurements are taken. These IDs  should be devised by the project team. Where measurements relate to an experimental set-up,  then the ID of the experimental set-up should be used, or incorporated within the  measurement location ID to enable a link to be made.    15. Measurement Type: This should be the type of measurement being taken e.g. vegetation  species, soil temperature, emission readings.      16. Method: This should briefly describe how the measurements are recorded, including an  instrument type and frequency of recording where appropriate, for example pin-frame or  quadrat for vegetation recording, theta-probe for soil moisture readings taken at hourly  intervals.

Data files are ordered into directories, the framework of which is provided below. Where  Quality assured data is provided, each point will have a quality assurance code, details of  which are provided in the Appendices. Most data are provided in .txt files generally split into  6 month blocks, January-June and July-December. However, there are times when the data is  split differently, at the start or end of data set or when the sampling frequency is such that the  number of rows exceeds what can be opened in excel. The name of the text file will generally  indicate the dates between which the data has been collected from.    Where necessary a description of the folder and its contents are provided in this catalogue.    Appendices are also included providing supplementary information which may be of use for  the database user.        Database framework    This simply illustrates how the folders and subfolders are laid out within the data base.

AWS    The data in this folder are from the automatic weather station, AWS, located at the bowl  within the instrumented hillslope (See Figs. 1 and 2). All sensors are sampled every 1 minute  and provided in the form of daily and 10 minute averages. Table 1 details headings and  measurement readings. In the daily data files daily maximum and daily minimum values are  given for some measurements as well as the daily average. Standard deviation is also given  for the wind direction.     Table 1.

Bowl study site runoff and soil water tension data    The data in this folder includes all data collected from the bowl study site except that from the  AWS, tipping bucket rain gauge, borehole and neutron probe monitoring. Figure 2 details the  instrumentation set up. The data are divided into runoff and tensiometer data. The runoff data  are further divided into that collected using the weir boxes and the tipping buckets.       Figure 2. Showing the Bowl study site instrumentation locations.       2.1 Bowl runoff    This folder includes all runoff data from the bowl study site within the instrumented hillslope.    2.1.1 Bowl runoff weir box    This contains data collected from the weir box systems at the bowl study site. Both weir  boxes have pressure transducers installed in stilling wells connected to the weir box system  and the height of water above a 90o weir was measured. Pressure transducers are both  connected to a central logger and measurements were initially sampled every 10 seconds and  the average logged every 1 minute. Latterly measurements were sampled every 10 seconds  and averaged every 5 minutes. Because of evaporation, water within the weir boxes  sometimes drops below the level of the weir. When estimates of water height in relation to the  bottom of the weir become increasingly negative it is assumed that no flow is occurring.  When there is an increase in the water height but it still below the bottom of the weir, the  change in volume within the weir box/unit time is used as an estimate of flow.     Flow is given in litres/second, ls-1. 8 2.1.1.1 Bowl drain flow weir box    This folder contains data from the weir box for which drain water from a 0.44 ha estimated  drainage area of the bowl study site flows through.      2.1.1.2 Bowl overland flow weir box    This folder contains data from the weir box for which overland flow water collected from an  estimated 0.36 ha area of the bowl study site flows through.      2.1.2 Bowl drain flow tipping bucket    This folder contains data collected from a tipping bucket system for which drain water from a  0.44 ha estimated drainage area of the bowl study site flows through. Once water has flowed  through the weir box system described in 2.1.1.1 it is routed through the tipping bucket  system which provides another estimate of drain flow.     Flow is given in litres/second. However, differences in sampling time occurred throughout the  monitoring period due to logger limitations. Changes in sampling time can be found by  examining specific data files. Changes in the size of the bucket also occurred during the  monitoring period. It is considered that the weir boxes provide a more accurate prediction of  the highest flows, however there are times when they are not operation.     2.1.3 Bowl overland flow tipping bucket    This folder contains data collected from a tipping bucket system for which overland flow  water from a 0.36 ha estimated drainage area of the bowl study site flows through. Once  water has flowed through the weir box system described in 2.1.1.2 it is routed through the  tipping bucket system which provides another estimate of overland flow.     Flow is given in litres/second. However, differences in sampling time occurred throughout the  monitoring period due to logger limitations. Changes in sampling time can be found by  examining specific data files. Changes in the size of the bucket also occurred during the  monitoring period. It is considered that the weir boxes provide a more accurate prediction of  the highest flows. However, there are times when they are not operation.     2.2 Bowl tensiometers    This folder contains tensiometer data collected from the bowl study site. Tensiometers are  located in arrays installed at 10 cm, 30 cm, and 50 cm depth. Figure 2 shows the location of  the tensiometer arrays, T1.1 –T2.4. All array locations shown were monitored until March  2008 when all tensiometers apart from those located at T1.3 and T2.3 were removed. Up until  this point all data are presented in one file for each monitoring period. Initially tensiometers  were all connected to one central logger. After March 2008, when tensiometer array numbers  were reduced to 2, each array data logged on separate loggers. From March 2008 onwards  data are separated; data files beginning with ‘Bowl_Tensio_Bot’ contains the data from  tensiometer array T1.3 and files beginning with ‘Bowl_Tensio_Top’ contains the data from  tensiometer array T2.3.    Tensiometer data are given in cm H2O. 9 3. Groundwater    This folder includes all data collected from the groundwater monitoring locations at the  instrumented hillslope at Tyn y Bryn farm. Groundwater has been monitored at 5 locations.  Groundwater is measured using Diver pressure transducers installed in boreholes with a  BaroDiver pressure transducer used to account for the effects of variations in barometric  pressure.  Data are presented in terms of height of water (cm) in relation to the soil surface.  Groundwater temperature (oC) is also given.     Groundwater height was initially sampled every 10 minutes until October 2006 when it was  changed to sampling every 30 minutes. Details of the boreholes are given in the appendix.    3.1 Borehole1    Borehole 1 is located in the field immediately above the bowl study site adjacent to Borehole  2.     3.2 Borehole2    Borehole 2 is located in the field immediately above the bowl study site adjacent to Borehole  1.     3.2 Borehole3    Borehole 3 is located in the bowl study site and is shown in Figure 2.     3.4 Borehole4    Borehole 4 is located above the tree shelterbelt in the tree shelterbelt hillslope as indicated in  Figure 3.    3.5 Borehole5     Borehole 5 is located below the tree shelterbelt in the tree shelterbelt hillslope as indicated in  Figure 3. 10 4. Hillslope study site runoff and soil water tension data    This folder includes all data collected from the tree shelterbelt hillslope except that collected  from the boreholes and neutron probe monitoring. Data are divided into runoff data collected  from the overland flow traps within the tree shelterbelt, drain flow and overland flow (from  the hillslope above the tree areas) and tensiometer data.       Figure 3. Showing the tree shelterbelt hillslope instrumentation locations.      4.1 Hillslope runoff weir box    This contains data collected from the weir box systems at the hillslope study site. Both weir  boxes have pressure transducers installed in stilling wells connected to the weir box system  and the height of water above a 90o weir was measured. Pressure transducers are both  connected to a central logger and measurements were sampled every 1 minute and averaged  and logged every 5 minutes. Because of evaporation, water within the weir boxes sometimes  dropped below the level of the weir. When estimates of water height in relation to the bottom  of the weir become increasingly negative it is assumed that no flow is occurring. When there  is an increase in the water height but it still below the bottom of the weir, the change in  volume within the weir box/unit time is used as an estimate of flow.     Flow is given in litres/second, ls-1. 11 4.1.1 Hillslope drain flow weir box    This folder contains data from the weir box for which drain water from an area of hillslope  above the tree shelterbelt flows through. At the time of producing this catalogue it was not  known the extent of the contributing drainage area.    4.1.2 Hillslope overland flow weir box    This folder contains data from the weir box for which overland flow water collected from an  area of hillslope above the tree shelterbelt flows through. Figure 3 shows the location of the  overland flow trap 32m in length. The data is patchy and there are some questions over the  quality in the data collected from this system because of continuous problems with rodents  (voles and moles) causing damage to the collection system. This is reflected in the quality  assurance codes assigned to a considerable amount of the data.     4.2 Hillslope tensiometers    This folder includes tensiometer data collected from the tree shelterbelt hillslope.  Tensiometers are located in arrays as shown in Figure 3. At all arrays apart from those located  within the tree planted area (T2.1-T2.3) are installed at 10 cm, 30 cm, and 50 cm depth.  Within the tree areas tensiometers are installed at 10 cm and 30 cm. All array locations shown  were monitored until April 2008 when tensiometers located at T1.1, T1.3, T2.3, T3.1 and  T3.3 were removed. Tensiometers are all connected to one central logger.     4.3 Tree shelterbelt overland flow    This folder contains data from the 2 overland flow traps installed within the tree shelterbelt  (see Fig. 3 for location). Traps are installed to collect data from two 5 m x 5 m isolated plots.  Initially plots were set up so that the cumulative overland flow volume (mm) occurring  between site visits could be measured. This setup was then replaced by tipping bucket  systems connected to data loggers (logging every 10 minutes) to provide continuous data in  litres/ second (ls-1).    5. Llyn Hir study site soil water tension data    This folder contains data from the tensiometer array installed at the Llyn Hir site adjacent to  the Llyn Hir rain gauges and close to Site 8 streamflow gauging site (see Fig. 1). Three  tensiometers are installed at 10 cm, 30 cm, and 50 cm depth and sampled every 10 minutes. In  September 2009 the sample time was increased to every 15 minutes to reduce the number of  times/month required for site visits.      Tensiometer data are given in cm H2O. 12 6. Land use manipulation plots    This folder contains tensiometer and overland flow data from each of the 4 manipulation plot  sites. The location of each of the manipulation plots sites is shown in Figure 1. Each  manipulation plot site has 3 replicate plots as shown in Figure 4. Replicate plots are labelled  1, 2, and 3 from left to right when looking up hill. Following initial baseline monitoring up  until January 2007, treatments were applied at each of the 4 sites. The 3 treatments are:  Grazed (i.e. control), Ungrazed (removal of sheep), and Trees (removal of sheep and planting  of trees). Within each manipulation plot the treatments where randomly allocated to the  replicate plots 1-3. Table 2 shows the treatment location within each plot.     Within each replicate plot three tensiometers are installed at 10 cm, 30 cm, and 50 cm depth  and sampled every 10 minutes. Tensiometer data are given in cm H2O. Overland flow from a  10m x 2.5m isolated plot is also measured within each replicate plot. Overland flow data from  the manipulation plots are given in millimetres/hour (mmh-1).    Table 2.

Neutron probe soil moisture data  This folder contains the neutron probe data measured at the bowl study site, instrumented  hillslope site, manipulation plot sites, tree areas and Llyn Hir. Where possible, profile  measurements are made every 10cm to a depth of down to 120cm.     Figure 2 and 3 show the locations of the neutron probe access tubes within the bowl and  hillslope study site respectively.     Within the manipulation plot neutron probe data file, plot i.d. M1-M4 refer to manipulation  plots 1-4 respectively. In the plot column the number 1-3 following the decimal place refers  to the treatment plot 1-3. For example Plot 2.1 refers to manipulation to treatment plot 1 in  manipulation plot 2 (the grazed treatment at Rhos2). The data from the access tube at Llyn  Hir are included in the manipulation plot neutron probe data file.     The details regarding the tree area locations are given in the FRMRC Research report UR16  impacts of upland land management on flood risk: multi-scale modelling methodology and  results from the Pontbren experiment.     The data presented in these files is the raw count data (16 second) as measured by the neutron  probe along with the shield (1 x 64 second) and water count (Average 5 x 64 second).     The straight line equation           count Water count Soil y _ _     is used to determine the moisture content where y is the volumetric moisture content,  y(cm3cm-3), and and  are the slope and intercept parameters respectively. Soil_count is  the neutron probe count as measured within the soil profile and Water_count is the neutron  probe count as measured within water.     At the time of putting this catalogue together, parameters values used for all sites where based  on the clay calibration as determined by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, where  =  0.96 and  = -0.01. It may be that an alternative parameter set is used, especially for the top  30cm of the Llyn Hir profile as there is a layer of peat present at this site. There is also a  relatively high organic matter content in the surface layer of the soil found at manipulation  plot 4.     8. Rain gauge data    This folder includes data collected from the rain gauges located across the Pontbren study  site. Where storage gauge data are available, this is also included in a separate file in the  respective subfolders. The location of the rain gauges is given in Figure 1.

Field Diaries    This folder contains a series of word documents of field notes for each of the monitoring  locations/instrumentation. The field notes describe some of the issues that may have occurred  and maybe used in reference to explain data issues. 16 10. Streamflow    This folder includes data from the stream flow monitoring sites located across the Pontbren  study sites (see Figure 3). Sites 1-9 and Site 13 are monitored using bed-mounted acoustic  Doppler monitoring systems (Starflows). At Site 10 changes in stage height is measured using  a pressure transducer and Sites 10 and 11 are monitored use v-notch weir plates with pressure  transducers.    Starflow monitoring: stage height and velocity are measured every minute and averaged every  15 minutes. For each 15 minutes water depth (mm), water temperature (oC), battery status  (V), cross-sectional area (cm2), Velocity (mms-1), and flow rate (ls-1). Because of  discrepancies between manual spot measurements of flow and that estimated by the starflow,  site specific straight line equations have been created relating starflow estimates with manual  spot measurements (a table of spot measurements made are included in the appendix).      x y     y is the calibrated estimate of flow in litres/second (ls-1), x is the starflow estimate of flow (ls- 1) and and  are site specific parameters, details of which are provided in table 3. Because  of limitations in the starflow’s ability to accurately measure low flows, data where the depth  of water is < 50 mm is deemed unacceptable for calibration purposes.      Table 3.

Response of Bengal and Assam Panel (BAAP) rice cultivars seedlings to Nitrogen Metadata  1/ Collection/generation methods Summary- Two data sheets in csv format on the trait values measured on 229 rice cultivars grown for 6 weeks in soils with two different nitrogen levels. Traits are plant height, number of tillers, nitrogen balance index, chlorophyll content (both measured with a Dualex, A Force, France), and shoot biomass. Two of the sheets are the raw values of every plant in the low N treatment (0N), and the high N treatment (100N).   Purpose- assess members of the BAAP for their response to nitrogen treatment over a 6-week period for identification of rice cultivars for high nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) plus quantitative trait loci (QTL) and candidate genes for NUE Location- School of Biological Sciences, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, UK.  Date- September and October 2020. Personnel- Yehia Hazzazi, Aadil Tantray Supervised by Adam Price and Gareth Norton Genetic material- 229 cultivars of the Bengal and Assam Association Panel (BAAP) of rice cultivar, which has been described in Norton et al., (2018) and which has an associated database of 2 million SNP markers.  Soil- equal volume mix of Insch soil from Insch field Farm, Aberdeenshire and builder’s sand.  Containers- Boxes of internal dimeson 160 cm in length, x 70 cm width and   27 cm height, made from plywood, lined with pond liner. These were filled with 600kg of soil/sand mix.  Treatment- There were two treatments, termed 0%N and 100%N. The 0%N treatment received no nutrients during the experiment. The 100%N treatment boxes received 16.12 g of urea each, calculated to represent 40 kg N ha-1 being the first split of a typical Bangladesh field application of 120 kg N ha-1 application achieved in three equal splits. For the first two weeks, the soil was moist but aerobic, after which it was flooded to approximately 5 cm above soil level. Plant Layout and replication- seeds were sown in a 23 x 10 grid 7 cm apart with two seeds for each genotype which was then thinned to one plant if two came up. Within a box, the 230 genotypes were sown randomly, and the four replicates for each treatment were paired as one 0%N and one 100% N box in a pair.  The 100%N treatment of replicate 1 was removed from analysis because a small leak in the pond liner meant that it received a soil and water environment different to other replicates of this treatment.  Controlled environment conditions- A controlled environment room was used, offering 28oC day and 25oC night temperatures (± 1oC). The light was applied 12 hrs a day with two Phytolux Attic 7 LED lamps per box, giving approximately 400 uM m2 s-1 PAR.  Humidity was maintained at over 50% using humidifiers. Measurements and harvest- Starting after two weeks, plant height and tiller number we counted on a weekly basis. Also, weekly a Dualex (Force A, France) was used to measure the nitrogen balance index (NBI), and chlorophyll content of the youngest fully expanded leaf. Plants were harvested at six weeks when shoots were dried at 80oC for 48 hrs, and shoot dry weight was measured.   2 Nature and Units of recorded values Plant height is measured in cm from the soil to the tip of the highest leaf when stretched upwards.  Tillers were counted for each plant, and have no units. Shoot biomass is measured as g on the above ground part of each plant dried at 80oC for two days.  A Dualex (A Force, France) was used to measure Nitrogen Balance Index (NBI) and Chlorophyl Index (ChI)- these have no unit.   3 Quality control   As noted above replicate 1 of the 100%N treatment was discarded for further analysis. While initial data entry was conducted as carefully as possible, Minitab was used to check for unusual observations (as reported in the two-way analysis of variance), and these were corrected only if a data entry error was identified.  4 Details of data structure The data are provided as simple spreadsheets which 11 columns as follows Column A: Replicate (1-4) Column B: Treatment (0 = no added nitrogen, 100 = added nitrogen) Column C: BAAP number = Unique ID for each member of the BAAP as first presented in Norton et al., (2018) Column D: BAAP name = cultivar name Column E: X = relative position of plant in X direction Column F: Y = relative position of plant in Y direction Columns G-K: measured trait data  5 Additional Information Funding- AP, AT and YH acknowledge the financial contribution from UK funded GCRF project “South Asia Nitrogen Hub”.

To understand exactly how the present Countryside Survey sampling framework has been derived, it is  important to review the concepts and activities that have evolved over the last 30 years since the first survey  was carried out.  It is possible that if the earlier time-series data were not so valuable as a basis for detecting  change, and a fresh start could be made today, then a different sampling strategy might be well be adopted.   However, the present Countryside Survey methodology is inextricably linked with its predecessors and an  understanding of these is essential.    Early development of the ITE Land Classification  The beginning  In the early 1970s, the idea of widespread ecological survey of areas as big as Great Britain was barely  conceivable.  However the concept of ecological sampling at a smaller scale (e.g. individual woodlands), was  commonly accepted and it was Bunce and Shaw13 who developed local regional survey into a national  ecological sampling system.  The important part of the approach was that the sampled areas should be  representative of the whole region and, to ensure this, they employed a stratification system.  The importance of a stratified system  In order to avoid bias in the selection of samples (thereby potentially invalidating the results), any sample  should be based on objective (e.g. random) selection procedures.  However, purely random sampling  programmes run the risk of selecting, by chance, a number of samples which are at one extreme in a range of  variability and therefore not ‘typical’ of the whole population being sampled.  An extreme example would be  where a national opinion poll, by chance, only included teenagers in the sample - their voting intentions may  not be representative of the voting population at large.    To minimise this risk, stratification systems are used to ‘carve up’ the population into discreet layers, or strata,  so that all parts of the population are sampled.  In the analogy above, most national opinion polls sample  within different age strata.  In ecological terms, it is likely that different species and ecological processes occur  in different types of land.  A simple stratification might then divide the land surface into different altitude ranges  so that uplands and lowlands, which tend to have different ecological characteristics, are adequately sampled.  However, this represents a very simple stratification and, just as opinion polls attempt to sample not just  different age strata but also those concerned with gender, social, racial and regional backgrounds, so other  factors are important in ecological survey.  Land at a certain altitude in north-east Scotland may have different 3 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007)  The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey   ecological affinities to land at the same altitude in East Anglia.  Thus other, secondary strata may need to be  introduced.  If this argument is extended to its logical conclusion, then it can be seen that many different strata  may need to be created by combining a number of different determining factors.  This is the theoretical basis  of the ITE Land Classification.    Development of the first version of the ITE Land Classification system.  In the early 1970s, Bunce and Shaw carried out a sample survey of the Lake District National Park.  They had  spent several years surveying and classifying vegetation in woodlands13 and elsewhere; this depended on  recording plant species in square plots (quadrats) and then classifying the quadrats into groups (vegetation  types) depending on which species were present.  Thus, all the quadrats in one group tended to have more or  less similar species present while those in another group had different species.  They used a multivariate  classification system called Indicator Species Analysis (ISA)35 to group the quadrats.  Bunce and Shaw  realised that the same approach could be ‘scaled up’ to classify areas of land, except that the quadrats would  be larger (eg a 1 km square) and, instead of using species as the basis of classifying, they would use  environmental attributes (such as altitude, geology and climate).  The work was pioneered in the Lake District  National Park and then extended and tested in Cumbria14, Lancashire and other regions of GB.  In 1975, the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology (ITE), capitalising on the potential of the approach, provided  funding for a national ecological survey of GB.  The survey had two major prerequisites:  •  it should be carried out using field survey (in order to obtain the level of ecological information required),   •  it should be carried out within a single field season.  As a result of the earlier work in Cumbria and elsewhere, it was thought that the sample unit of a 1km square  was appropriate, being small enough to survey in a reasonable period of time and yet large enough to contain  sufficient environmental features to allow differentiation of squares.  With over 240,000 1km squares in GB, a  sampling approach was an obvious necessity and a stratified, random sampling system was then developed –  the ITE Land Classification was born.  In the mid-1970s, when this work was being done, computing power was such that software packages like ISA  could only operate on a limited number of datasets.  Thus it was not possible to create a classification of all 1  km squares in GB and an alternative strategy had to be found.  By taking the centre square of a 15 x 15 km  grid across GB, a suitable number of squares was identified for classification (1228).  Environmental,  physiographic and other mapped data were then collected for each of the 1228 squares and the dataset was  analysed using ISA to produce 32 classes (Table 1).  Four squares surrounding each of the classified squares  were also allocated to classes using the key provided by ISA; thus a total of 6040 squares were classified  (Figure 1).  Full details of this procedure can be found in Bunce et al6 and Bunce et al7.  The 32 classes were  then described based on the average values of the environmental characteristics that were used to generate  the classes (for example, average altitude, slope and rainfall, and host of other environmental values).    The sampling framework for the first ecological survey of GB in 1978  Having generated the classification which would act as the sampling stratification system, the number of  samples to be surveyed was considered.  Ideally, this number would depend on the size of the stratum (ie how  many 1 km squares of the class occurred in GB) and on the ecological variability within the stratum.  Previous  work had suggested that for ecological surveys of this type, at least eight samples per stratum were  necessary.  Since this was the minimum requirement for each class, and resources were not available to  survey more squares, then eight were selected at random from each of the classes.  These squares were  taken from the grid of classified squares and thus the final sample for the first GB survey was a gridded,  stratified, random sample of 256 1 km squares.  The survey was actually carried out in the summers of 1977  (when a few pilot squares were sampled) and 1978 and focussed on vegetation quadrats and soils; habitat  areas were also mapped. 4 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007) The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey Table 1.

Map of ‘original’ (1978) ITE Land Classification 6 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007) The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey   The sampling framework for the second, land use survey of GB in 1984  In 1984, ITE funded a further GB survey although, by this time, the emphasis had shifted away from ecological  features such as soils and plant species in quadrats, to land use, landscape features and habitat mapping.   The same sampling framework was used as in 1978 but the sample size was increased by 50% so that 12  squares were surveyed in each of the 32 classes (including the eight squares previously visited).  With the  benefit of hindsight, there is an argument for having allocated the additional 128 new squares according to  land class size which would certainly have reduced the statistical error terms associated with national  estimates made from the sample.  However, this was not done.  Examples of change statistics between 1978  and 1984 were published in Barr et al.2    Application of the ITE Land Classification to Countryside Survey 1990   By 1990, and following the Ecological Consequences of Land Use Change (ECOLUC) programme carried out  by ITE on contract to the then Department of the Environment (DOE)3, both scientific and policy needs for a  further survey were identified.  Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990) was initiated with DOE, NERC, DTI and  NCC all contributing funding.  The first Land Cover Map of GB, derived from satellite imagery was also linked  to this programme.  Again, the ITE Land Classification was used as the sampling framework for a field survey but, in this third  survey, additional squares were allocated only to the larger land classes.  A total of 508 squares was surveyed  and all the features recorded in the 1984 survey, plus a repeat of the 1978 vegetation quadrats, was carried  out3.  The distribution of the squares within the Land Classes is shown in Table 2 and a map of sites is shown  as Figure 2.    Further development of the ITE Land Classification  CS1990 still used the original, gridded land classification that had been developed in the mid-1970s and  results were published based on the use of that system.  However, it became apparent that for estimations at  the regional and local level, the land classification had to be extended so that every square in GB was  classified.    Although computing power had increased considerably since the first classification, it was still an  insurmountable task to collect data for every square in GB at the same level of detail as had been done in the  original work.  Instead, the major climatic, geological and physiographic factors (or valid surrogates for these)  were obtained for each square and then a variety of multivariate classification procedures was tested on the  resulting dataset.  When the classes of the original sample of 1228 squares were compared with the new  classification attempts, the best simulation resulted in only a 62% correspondence.  However, all of the  squares that did not match exactly did fall into neighbouring land classes and the average characteristics of  the class remained unchanged, thus the classification was accepted as a reasonable replacement for its  earlier counterpart (Figure 3).    The net effect of this on the sampling framework was that as a result of some of the squares changing class,  the distribution across land classes was distorted and some classes were not well represented.  The effect of  this can be seen in column 3 of Table 2. 7 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007)  The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey   Figure 2.

Map of the ‘new’ (1990) ITE Land Classification. 9 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007)  The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey   Developments of the ITE Land Classification for Countryside Survey 2000  During the planning stages of Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000), there was consideration of sample  numbers in connection with several of the component modules.  This involved re-assessment of the existing  (CS1990) sample as well as the need for additional 1 km squares.  A number of issues have arisen from an  independent appraisal of CS1990 for policy purposes.  These include:  •  the effects of the changed ITE Land Classification.  •  the need to produce separate reliable estimates of surveyed features for Scotland and England with  Wales,  •  the need to provide statistically reliable estimates of upland habitats in England and Wales.  The new ITE Land Classification  As discussed above, the application of the new ITE Land Classification has resulted in some classes being  under-represented.  To correct this imbalance, a number of new squares were included as part of CS2000; the  details of how these are allocated are presented below, under ‘Separate country estimates’.  Separate country estimates  In CS1990, 508 1 km squares were sampled in England, Scotland, Wales and the Isle of Man.  The sample of  squares was drawn at random from a grid of squares in the 32 ITE Land Classes.  As described above, these  classes were created using underlying environmental attributes and therefore crossed country (E, S & W)  boundaries.  Country estimates were derived from the mean characteristics of all squares in each class,  irrespective of their country location.  A CS2000 Scoping Study34 recommended that the sampling framework should be modified to enable reporting  on ‘country units’, being (a) England with Wales and (b) Scotland, separately using only squares which lie in  the country for which estimates are to be made.  Additional samples have been deployed to assist with this requirement and the following changes have been  made to the sampling framework:  • class sub-division - the ITE Land Classes have been sub-divided into the ‘country unit’ versions of the  original classes,  • class aggregation - where this has resulted in there being very few squares of any particular class  remaining in a country, then this ‘rump’ has been aggregated with a similar class in that country (the net effect  of the class sub-divisions and aggregations is to create 40 strata, instead of the earlier 32),  • additional squares - to ensure that there is adequate representation of all new classes in each country unit,  19 additional squares have been allocated and this gives a minimum of 6 squares in each new class.  To  ensure relatively consistent sampling rates between England and Wales, a further 11 squares (5 in England  and 6 in Wales) have been allocated,  • Land Class 17 - Wales is dominated by Land Class 17 and to help refine the results reported for Wales, a  sub-division of Land Class 17 has been carried out in Wales.  In the allocation of any new squares in Wales  (either detailed above or in any further options), representation of the new sub-classes has been respected.  • Isle of Man – the two sample squares in the IOM included in previous surveys do not contribute to  estimates for ‘country units’ and are replaced by two new squares in England.  The revised land class maps for England with Wales and for Scotland are shown as Figure 4. 10 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007) The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey Figure 4.  Map of revised ITE Land Classes in ‘England with Wales’ and in Scotland – the  sampling framework for CS2000 11 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007)  The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey   Survey of uplands in England and Wales  An additional module within CS2000, funded by DETR, MAFF, and WO/CCW, included surveying an  additional 30 squares which have been placed in ITE Land Classes which occur in the uplands and marginal  uplands of England and Wales.  This gives better statistical accuracy to the estimates of habitats in the uplands of England and Wales which,  due to the need to provide separate, country-based estimates, would otherwise be under-sampled.

Map of the CS2000 sample squares in England with Wales, and in Scotland. 14 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007) The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey Developments of the ITE Land Classification for Countryside Survey 2007      Prior to the 2007 Countryside Survey, it became apparent that in addition to the requirement for Scotland-only  results (provided for in the 2000 Land Classification) further adjustments were required to accommodate  Wales-only results.  Since devolution, there has been an increasing need for the National Assembly of Wales  and environmental organisations to have access to habitat status and change information on a Wales-only  basis in order to meet the requirements of country-specific environmental policy and legislation.      Welsh-only Estimates    The adjustments in CS2000 included the addition of some Welsh squares, bringing their number up to 64, and  making Wales the most intensively sampled of the three individual countries (England 0.22%, Scotland 0.24%  and Wales 0.29% of total land area). However, in regard to the precision of national estimates, which depends  on absolute numbers rather than proportions, the number of field survey squares in Wales is low compared to  the number in Scotland (203) and England (302).   A scoping report in 200642 concludes that the existing  number of 64 squares in Wales was not adequate for Wales-only reporting for the 2007 survey.  As a consequence, the following changes were made to the 2000 sampling framework for 2007:  •  Class sub-divisions – the ITE Land Classes have been sub-divided into the ‘country unit’ (England and  Wales) versions of the original land classes creating five new classes: 5w, 6w, 7w,15w,18w  •  Number of classes - the effect of the class sub-divisions is to create 45 strata instead of the earlier 40  •  Additional squares – to ensure that there is adequate representation of new classes in Wales, a total of  43 additional squares were surveyed in Wales, this gives a minimum of 6 squares in each Welsh class.  •  Additional squares in England to compensate for the removal of Welsh squares were not warranted.   Two of the English Classes (5e, 15e) are left with only 4 squares per class, however, the 2006 scoping  study42 states the reduction in precision of English estimates is relatively small and the small number of  squares in these classes should still be adequate for reporting purposes.    The revised class map for England, Wales and Scotland is shown in figure 6. 15 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007)  The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey   Figure 6.

Estimates for GB for example can be  calculated either using the latest classification (effectively three separate classifications for the three countries)  or the original (1990) classification.  For consistency with in an individual survey the former approach is  preferred whilst the latter is more consistent across surveys’.

Data files are ordered into directories, the framework of which is provided below. Where  Quality assured data is provided, each point will have a quality assurance code, details of  which are provided in the Appendices. Most data are provided in .txt files generally split into  6 month blocks, January-June and July-December. However, there are times when the data is  split differently, at the start or end of data set or when the sampling frequency is such that the  number of rows exceeds what can be opened in excel. The name of the text file will generally  indicate the dates between which the data has been collected from.    Where necessary a description of the folder and its contents are provided in this catalogue.    Appendices are also included providing supplementary information which may be of use for  the database user.        Database framework    This simply illustrates how the folders and subfolders are laid out within the data base.

AWS    The data in this folder are from the automatic weather station, AWS, located at the bowl  within the instrumented hillslope (See Figs. 1 and 2). All sensors are sampled every 1 minute  and provided in the form of daily and 10 minute averages. Table 1 details headings and  measurement readings. In the daily data files daily maximum and daily minimum values are  given for some measurements as well as the daily average. Standard deviation is also given  for the wind direction.     Table 1.

These extra columns exist because a new temp. / relative humidity sensor was  installed at the same time as the original because of concerns that the original was not  measuring the relative humidity correctly.

Bowl study site runoff and soil water tension data    The data in this folder includes all data collected from the bowl study site except that from the  AWS, tipping bucket rain gauge, borehole and neutron probe monitoring. Figure 2 details the  instrumentation set up. The data are divided into runoff and tensiometer data. The runoff data  are further divided into that collected using the weir boxes and the tipping buckets.       Figure 2. Showing the Bowl study site instrumentation locations.       2.1 Bowl runoff    This folder includes all runoff data from the bowl study site within the instrumented hillslope.    2.1.1 Bowl runoff weir box    This contains data collected from the weir box systems at the bowl study site. Both weir  boxes have pressure transducers installed in stilling wells connected to the weir box system  and the height of water above a 90o weir was measured. Pressure transducers are both  connected to a central logger and measurements were initially sampled every 10 seconds and  the average logged every 1 minute. Latterly measurements were sampled every 10 seconds  and averaged every 5 minutes. Because of evaporation, water within the weir boxes  sometimes drops below the level of the weir. When estimates of water height in relation to the  bottom of the weir become increasingly negative it is assumed that no flow is occurring.  When there is an increase in the water height but it still below the bottom of the weir, the  change in volume within the weir box/unit time is used as an estimate of flow.     Flow is given in litres/second, ls-1. 8 2.1.1.1 Bowl drain flow weir box    This folder contains data from the weir box for which drain water from a 0.44 ha estimated  drainage area of the bowl study site flows through.      2.1.1.2 Bowl overland flow weir box    This folder contains data from the weir box for which overland flow water collected from an  estimated 0.36 ha area of the bowl study site flows through.      2.1.2 Bowl drain flow tipping bucket    This folder contains data collected from a tipping bucket system for which drain water from a  0.44 ha estimated drainage area of the bowl study site flows through. Once water has flowed  through the weir box system described in 2.1.1.1 it is routed through the tipping bucket  system which provides another estimate of drain flow.     Flow is given in litres/second. However, differences in sampling time occurred throughout the  monitoring period due to logger limitations. Changes in sampling time can be found by  examining specific data files. Changes in the size of the bucket also occurred during the  monitoring period. It is considered that the weir boxes provide a more accurate prediction of  the highest flows, however there are times when they are not operation.     2.1.3 Bowl overland flow tipping bucket    This folder contains data collected from a tipping bucket system for which overland flow  water from a 0.36 ha estimated drainage area of the bowl study site flows through. Once  water has flowed through the weir box system described in 2.1.1.2 it is routed through the  tipping bucket system which provides another estimate of overland flow.     Flow is given in litres/second. However, differences in sampling time occurred throughout the  monitoring period due to logger limitations. Changes in sampling time can be found by  examining specific data files. Changes in the size of the bucket also occurred during the  monitoring period. It is considered that the weir boxes provide a more accurate prediction of  the highest flows. However, there are times when they are not operation.     2.2 Bowl tensiometers    This folder contains tensiometer data collected from the bowl study site. Tensiometers are  located in arrays installed at 10 cm, 30 cm, and 50 cm depth. Figure 2 shows the location of  the tensiometer arrays, T1.1 –T2.4. All array locations shown were monitored until March  2008 when all tensiometers apart from those located at T1.3 and T2.3 were removed. Up until  this point all data are presented in one file for each monitoring period. Initially tensiometers  were all connected to one central logger. After March 2008, when tensiometer array numbers  were reduced to 2, each array data logged on separate loggers. From March 2008 onwards  data are separated; data files beginning with ‘Bowl_Tensio_Bot’ contains the data from  tensiometer array T1.3 and files beginning with ‘Bowl_Tensio_Top’ contains the data from  tensiometer array T2.3.    Tensiometer data are given in cm H2O. 9 3. Groundwater    This folder includes all data collected from the groundwater monitoring locations at the  instrumented hillslope at Tyn y Bryn farm. Groundwater has been monitored at 5 locations.  Groundwater is measured using Diver pressure transducers installed in boreholes with a  BaroDiver pressure transducer used to account for the effects of variations in barometric  pressure.  Data are presented in terms of height of water (cm) in relation to the soil surface.  Groundwater temperature (oC) is also given.     Groundwater height was initially sampled every 10 minutes until October 2006 when it was  changed to sampling every 30 minutes. Details of the boreholes are given in the appendix.    3.1 Borehole1    Borehole 1 is located in the field immediately above the bowl study site adjacent to Borehole  2.     3.2 Borehole2    Borehole 2 is located in the field immediately above the bowl study site adjacent to Borehole  1.     3.2 Borehole3    Borehole 3 is located in the bowl study site and is shown in Figure 2.     3.4 Borehole4    Borehole 4 is located above the tree shelterbelt in the tree shelterbelt hillslope as indicated in  Figure 3.    3.5 Borehole5     Borehole 5 is located below the tree shelterbelt in the tree shelterbelt hillslope as indicated in  Figure 3. 10 4. Hillslope study site runoff and soil water tension data    This folder includes all data collected from the tree shelterbelt hillslope except that collected  from the boreholes and neutron probe monitoring. Data are divided into runoff data collected  from the overland flow traps within the tree shelterbelt, drain flow and overland flow (from  the hillslope above the tree areas) and tensiometer data.       Figure 3. Showing the tree shelterbelt hillslope instrumentation locations.      4.1 Hillslope runoff weir box    This contains data collected from the weir box systems at the hillslope study site. Both weir  boxes have pressure transducers installed in stilling wells connected to the weir box system  and the height of water above a 90o weir was measured. Pressure transducers are both  connected to a central logger and measurements were sampled every 1 minute and averaged  and logged every 5 minutes. Because of evaporation, water within the weir boxes sometimes  dropped below the level of the weir. When estimates of water height in relation to the bottom  of the weir become increasingly negative it is assumed that no flow is occurring. When there  is an increase in the water height but it still below the bottom of the weir, the change in  volume within the weir box/unit time is used as an estimate of flow.     Flow is given in litres/second, ls-1. 11 4.1.1 Hillslope drain flow weir box    This folder contains data from the weir box for which drain water from an area of hillslope  above the tree shelterbelt flows through. At the time of producing this catalogue it was not  known the extent of the contributing drainage area.    4.1.2 Hillslope overland flow weir box    This folder contains data from the weir box for which overland flow water collected from an  area of hillslope above the tree shelterbelt flows through. Figure 3 shows the location of the  overland flow trap 32m in length. The data is patchy and there are some questions over the  quality in the data collected from this system because of continuous problems with rodents  (voles and moles) causing damage to the collection system. This is reflected in the quality  assurance codes assigned to a considerable amount of the data.     4.2 Hillslope tensiometers    This folder includes tensiometer data collected from the tree shelterbelt hillslope.  Tensiometers are located in arrays as shown in Figure 3. At all arrays apart from those located  within the tree planted area (T2.1-T2.3) are installed at 10 cm, 30 cm, and 50 cm depth.  Within the tree areas tensiometers are installed at 10 cm and 30 cm. All array locations shown  were monitored until April 2008 when tensiometers located at T1.1, T1.3, T2.3, T3.1 and  T3.3 were removed. Tensiometers are all connected to one central logger.     4.3 Tree shelterbelt overland flow    This folder contains data from the 2 overland flow traps installed within the tree shelterbelt  (see Fig. 3 for location). Traps are installed to collect data from two 5 m x 5 m isolated plots.  Initially plots were set up so that the cumulative overland flow volume (mm) occurring  between site visits could be measured. This setup was then replaced by tipping bucket  systems connected to data loggers (logging every 10 minutes) to provide continuous data in  litres/ second (ls-1).    5. Llyn Hir study site soil water tension data    This folder contains data from the tensiometer array installed at the Llyn Hir site adjacent to  the Llyn Hir rain gauges and close to Site 8 streamflow gauging site (see Fig. 1). Three  tensiometers are installed at 10 cm, 30 cm, and 50 cm depth and sampled every 10 minutes. In  September 2009 the sample time was increased to every 15 minutes to reduce the number of  times/month required for site visits.      Tensiometer data are given in cm H2O. 12 6. Land use manipulation plots    This folder contains tensiometer and overland flow data from each of the 4 manipulation plot  sites. The location of each of the manipulation plots sites is shown in Figure 1. Each  manipulation plot site has 3 replicate plots as shown in Figure 4. Replicate plots are labelled  1, 2, and 3 from left to right when looking up hill. Following initial baseline monitoring up  until January 2007, treatments were applied at each of the 4 sites. The 3 treatments are:  Grazed (i.e. control), Ungrazed (removal of sheep), and Trees (removal of sheep and planting  of trees). Within each manipulation plot the treatments where randomly allocated to the  replicate plots 1-3. Table 2 shows the treatment location within each plot.     Within each replicate plot three tensiometers are installed at 10 cm, 30 cm, and 50 cm depth  and sampled every 10 minutes. Tensiometer data are given in cm H2O. Overland flow from a  10m x 2.5m isolated plot is also measured within each replicate plot. Overland flow data from  the manipulation plots are given in millimetres/hour (mmh-1).    Table 2.

Neutron probe soil moisture data  This folder contains the neutron probe data measured at the bowl study site, instrumented  hillslope site, manipulation plot sites, tree areas and Llyn Hir. Where possible, profile  measurements are made every 10cm to a depth of down to 120cm.     Figure 2 and 3 show the locations of the neutron probe access tubes within the bowl and  hillslope study site respectively.     Within the manipulation plot neutron probe data file, plot i.d. M1-M4 refer to manipulation  plots 1-4 respectively. In the plot column the number 1-3 following the decimal place refers  to the treatment plot 1-3. For example Plot 2.1 refers to manipulation to treatment plot 1 in  manipulation plot 2 (the grazed treatment at Rhos2). The data from the access tube at Llyn  Hir are included in the manipulation plot neutron probe data file.     The details regarding the tree area locations are given in the FRMRC Research report UR16  impacts of upland land management on flood risk: multi-scale modelling methodology and  results from the Pontbren experiment.     The data presented in these files is the raw count data (16 second) as measured by the neutron  probe along with the shield (1 x 64 second) and water count (Average 5 x 64 second).     The straight line equation           count Water count Soil y _ _     is used to determine the moisture content where y is the volumetric moisture content,  y(cm3cm-3), and and  are the slope and intercept parameters respectively. Soil_count is  the neutron probe count as measured within the soil profile and Water_count is the neutron  probe count as measured within water.     At the time of putting this catalogue together, parameters values used for all sites where based  on the clay calibration as determined by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, where  =  0.96 and  = -0.01. It may be that an alternative parameter set is used, especially for the top  30cm of the Llyn Hir profile as there is a layer of peat present at this site. There is also a  relatively high organic matter content in the surface layer of the soil found at manipulation  plot 4.     8. Rain gauge data    This folder includes data collected from the rain gauges located across the Pontbren study  site. Where storage gauge data are available, this is also included in a separate file in the  respective subfolders. The location of the rain gauges is given in Figure 1.

The rain gauges here sit ~ 300mm above ground level. A  ditch with a rain gauge grid surrounds each gauge. Height AOD = 221m.    9. Field Diaries    This folder contains a series of word documents of field notes for each of the monitoring  locations/instrumentation. The field notes describe some of the issues that may have occurred  and maybe used in reference to explain data issues. 16 10. Streamflow    This folder includes data from the stream flow monitoring sites located across the Pontbren  study sites (see Figure 3). Sites 1-9 and Site 13 are monitored using bed-mounted acoustic  Doppler monitoring systems (Starflows). At Site 10 changes in stage height is measured using  a pressure transducer and Sites 10 and 11 are monitored use v-notch weir plates with pressure  transducers.    Starflow monitoring: stage height and velocity are measured every minute and averaged every  15 minutes. For each 15 minutes water depth (mm), water temperature (oC), battery status  (V), cross-sectional area (cm2), Velocity (mms-1), and flow rate (ls-1). Because of  discrepancies between manual spot measurements of flow and that estimated by the starflow,  site specific straight line equations have been created relating starflow estimates with manual  spot measurements (a table of spot measurements made are included in the appendix).      x y     y is the calibrated estimate of flow in litres/second (ls-1), x is the starflow estimate of flow (ls- 1) and and  are site specific parameters, details of which are provided in table 3. Because  of limitations in the starflow’s ability to accurately measure low flows, data where the depth  of water is < 50 mm is deemed unacceptable for calibration purposes.      Table 3.

To understand exactly how the present Countryside Survey sampling framework has been derived, it is  important to review the concepts and activities that have evolved over the last 30 years since the first survey  was carried out.  It is possible that if the earlier time-series data were not so valuable as a basis for detecting  change, and a fresh start could be made today, then a different sampling strategy might be well be adopted.   However, the present Countryside Survey methodology is inextricably linked with its predecessors and an  understanding of these is essential.    Early development of the ITE Land Classification  The beginning  In the early 1970s, the idea of widespread ecological survey of areas as big as Great Britain was barely  conceivable.  However the concept of ecological sampling at a smaller scale (e.g. individual woodlands), was  commonly accepted and it was Bunce and Shaw13 who developed local regional survey into a national  ecological sampling system.  The important part of the approach was that the sampled areas should be  representative of the whole region and, to ensure this, they employed a stratification system.  The importance of a stratified system  In order to avoid bias in the selection of samples (thereby potentially invalidating the results), any sample  should be based on objective (e.g. random) selection procedures.  However, purely random sampling  programmes run the risk of selecting, by chance, a number of samples which are at one extreme in a range of  variability and therefore not ‘typical’ of the whole population being sampled.  An extreme example would be  where a national opinion poll, by chance, only included teenagers in the sample - their voting intentions may  not be representative of the voting population at large.    To minimise this risk, stratification systems are used to ‘carve up’ the population into discreet layers, or strata,  so that all parts of the population are sampled.  In the analogy above, most national opinion polls sample  within different age strata.  In ecological terms, it is likely that different species and ecological processes occur  in different types of land.  A simple stratification might then divide the land surface into different altitude ranges  so that uplands and lowlands, which tend to have different ecological characteristics, are adequately sampled.  However, this represents a very simple stratification and, just as opinion polls attempt to sample not just  different age strata but also those concerned with gender, social, racial and regional backgrounds, so other  factors are important in ecological survey.  Land at a certain altitude in north-east Scotland may have different 3 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007)  The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey   ecological affinities to land at the same altitude in East Anglia.  Thus other, secondary strata may need to be  introduced.  If this argument is extended to its logical conclusion, then it can be seen that many different strata  may need to be created by combining a number of different determining factors.  This is the theoretical basis  of the ITE Land Classification.    Development of the first version of the ITE Land Classification system.  In the early 1970s, Bunce and Shaw carried out a sample survey of the Lake District National Park.  They had  spent several years surveying and classifying vegetation in woodlands13 and elsewhere; this depended on  recording plant species in square plots (quadrats) and then classifying the quadrats into groups (vegetation  types) depending on which species were present.  Thus, all the quadrats in one group tended to have more or  less similar species present while those in another group had different species.  They used a multivariate  classification system called Indicator Species Analysis (ISA)35 to group the quadrats.  Bunce and Shaw  realised that the same approach could be ‘scaled up’ to classify areas of land, except that the quadrats would  be larger (eg a 1 km square) and, instead of using species as the basis of classifying, they would use  environmental attributes (such as altitude, geology and climate).  The work was pioneered in the Lake District  National Park and then extended and tested in Cumbria14, Lancashire and other regions of GB.  In 1975, the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology (ITE), capitalising on the potential of the approach, provided  funding for a national ecological survey of GB.  The survey had two major prerequisites:  •  it should be carried out using field survey (in order to obtain the level of ecological information required),   •  it should be carried out within a single field season.  As a result of the earlier work in Cumbria and elsewhere, it was thought that the sample unit of a 1km square  was appropriate, being small enough to survey in a reasonable period of time and yet large enough to contain  sufficient environmental features to allow differentiation of squares.  With over 240,000 1km squares in GB, a  sampling approach was an obvious necessity and a stratified, random sampling system was then developed –  the ITE Land Classification was born.  In the mid-1970s, when this work was being done, computing power was such that software packages like ISA  could only operate on a limited number of datasets.  Thus it was not possible to create a classification of all 1  km squares in GB and an alternative strategy had to be found.  By taking the centre square of a 15 x 15 km  grid across GB, a suitable number of squares was identified for classification (1228).  Environmental,  physiographic and other mapped data were then collected for each of the 1228 squares and the dataset was  analysed using ISA to produce 32 classes (Table 1).  Four squares surrounding each of the classified squares  were also allocated to classes using the key provided by ISA; thus a total of 6040 squares were classified  (Figure 1).  Full details of this procedure can be found in Bunce et al6 and Bunce et al7.  The 32 classes were  then described based on the average values of the environmental characteristics that were used to generate  the classes (for example, average altitude, slope and rainfall, and host of other environmental values).    The sampling framework for the first ecological survey of GB in 1978  Having generated the classification which would act as the sampling stratification system, the number of  samples to be surveyed was considered.  Ideally, this number would depend on the size of the stratum (ie how  many 1 km squares of the class occurred in GB) and on the ecological variability within the stratum.  Previous  work had suggested that for ecological surveys of this type, at least eight samples per stratum were  necessary.  Since this was the minimum requirement for each class, and resources were not available to  survey more squares, then eight were selected at random from each of the classes.  These squares were  taken from the grid of classified squares and thus the final sample for the first GB survey was a gridded,  stratified, random sample of 256 1 km squares.  The survey was actually carried out in the summers of 1977  (when a few pilot squares were sampled) and 1978 and focussed on vegetation quadrats and soils; habitat  areas were also mapped. 4 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007) The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey Table 1.

Map of ‘original’ (1978) ITE Land Classification 6 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007) The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey   The sampling framework for the second, land use survey of GB in 1984  In 1984, ITE funded a further GB survey although, by this time, the emphasis had shifted away from ecological  features such as soils and plant species in quadrats, to land use, landscape features and habitat mapping.   The same sampling framework was used as in 1978 but the sample size was increased by 50% so that 12  squares were surveyed in each of the 32 classes (including the eight squares previously visited).  With the  benefit of hindsight, there is an argument for having allocated the additional 128 new squares according to  land class size which would certainly have reduced the statistical error terms associated with national  estimates made from the sample.  However, this was not done.  Examples of change statistics between 1978  and 1984 were published in Barr et al.2    Application of the ITE Land Classification to Countryside Survey 1990   By 1990, and following the Ecological Consequences of Land Use Change (ECOLUC) programme carried out  by ITE on contract to the then Department of the Environment (DOE)3, both scientific and policy needs for a  further survey were identified.  Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990) was initiated with DOE, NERC, DTI and  NCC all contributing funding.  The first Land Cover Map of GB, derived from satellite imagery was also linked  to this programme.  Again, the ITE Land Classification was used as the sampling framework for a field survey but, in this third  survey, additional squares were allocated only to the larger land classes.  A total of 508 squares was surveyed  and all the features recorded in the 1984 survey, plus a repeat of the 1978 vegetation quadrats, was carried  out3.  The distribution of the squares within the Land Classes is shown in Table 2 and a map of sites is shown  as Figure 2.    Further development of the ITE Land Classification  CS1990 still used the original, gridded land classification that had been developed in the mid-1970s and  results were published based on the use of that system.  However, it became apparent that for estimations at  the regional and local level, the land classification had to be extended so that every square in GB was  classified.    Although computing power had increased considerably since the first classification, it was still an  insurmountable task to collect data for every square in GB at the same level of detail as had been done in the  original work.  Instead, the major climatic, geological and physiographic factors (or valid surrogates for these)  were obtained for each square and then a variety of multivariate classification procedures was tested on the  resulting dataset.  When the classes of the original sample of 1228 squares were compared with the new  classification attempts, the best simulation resulted in only a 62% correspondence.  However, all of the  squares that did not match exactly did fall into neighbouring land classes and the average characteristics of  the class remained unchanged, thus the classification was accepted as a reasonable replacement for its  earlier counterpart (Figure 3).    The net effect of this on the sampling framework was that as a result of some of the squares changing class,  the distribution across land classes was distorted and some classes were not well represented.  The effect of  this can be seen in column 3 of Table 2. 7 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007)  The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey   Figure 2.

Map of the ‘new’ (1990) ITE Land Classification. 9 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007)  The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey   Developments of the ITE Land Classification for Countryside Survey 2000  During the planning stages of Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000), there was consideration of sample  numbers in connection with several of the component modules.  This involved re-assessment of the existing  (CS1990) sample as well as the need for additional 1 km squares.  A number of issues have arisen from an  independent appraisal of CS1990 for policy purposes.  These include:  •  the effects of the changed ITE Land Classification.  •  the need to produce separate reliable estimates of surveyed features for Scotland and England with  Wales,  •  the need to provide statistically reliable estimates of upland habitats in England and Wales.  The new ITE Land Classification  As discussed above, the application of the new ITE Land Classification has resulted in some classes being  under-represented.  To correct this imbalance, a number of new squares were included as part of CS2000; the  details of how these are allocated are presented below, under ‘Separate country estimates’.  Separate country estimates  In CS1990, 508 1 km squares were sampled in England, Scotland, Wales and the Isle of Man.  The sample of  squares was drawn at random from a grid of squares in the 32 ITE Land Classes.  As described above, these  classes were created using underlying environmental attributes and therefore crossed country (E, S & W)  boundaries.  Country estimates were derived from the mean characteristics of all squares in each class,  irrespective of their country location.  A CS2000 Scoping Study34 recommended that the sampling framework should be modified to enable reporting  on ‘country units’, being (a) England with Wales and (b) Scotland, separately using only squares which lie in  the country for which estimates are to be made.  Additional samples have been deployed to assist with this requirement and the following changes have been  made to the sampling framework:  • class sub-division - the ITE Land Classes have been sub-divided into the ‘country unit’ versions of the  original classes,  • class aggregation - where this has resulted in there being very few squares of any particular class  remaining in a country, then this ‘rump’ has been aggregated with a similar class in that country (the net effect  of the class sub-divisions and aggregations is to create 40 strata, instead of the earlier 32),  • additional squares - to ensure that there is adequate representation of all new classes in each country unit,  19 additional squares have been allocated and this gives a minimum of 6 squares in each new class.  To  ensure relatively consistent sampling rates between England and Wales, a further 11 squares (5 in England  and 6 in Wales) have been allocated,  • Land Class 17 - Wales is dominated by Land Class 17 and to help refine the results reported for Wales, a  sub-division of Land Class 17 has been carried out in Wales.  In the allocation of any new squares in Wales  (either detailed above or in any further options), representation of the new sub-classes has been respected.  • Isle of Man – the two sample squares in the IOM included in previous surveys do not contribute to  estimates for ‘country units’ and are replaced by two new squares in England.  The revised land class maps for England with Wales and for Scotland are shown as Figure 4. 10 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007) The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey Figure 4.  Map of revised ITE Land Classes in ‘England with Wales’ and in Scotland – the  sampling framework for CS2000 11 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007)  The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey   Survey of uplands in England and Wales  An additional module within CS2000, funded by DETR, MAFF, and WO/CCW, included surveying an  additional 30 squares which have been placed in ITE Land Classes which occur in the uplands and marginal  uplands of England and Wales.  This gives better statistical accuracy to the estimates of habitats in the uplands of England and Wales which,  due to the need to provide separate, country-based estimates, would otherwise be under-sampled.

Map of the CS2000 sample squares in England with Wales, and in Scotland. 14 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007) The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey Developments of the ITE Land Classification for Countryside Survey 2007      Prior to the 2007 Countryside Survey, it became apparent that in addition to the requirement for Scotland-only  results (provided for in the 2000 Land Classification) further adjustments were required to accommodate  Wales-only results.  Since devolution, there has been an increasing need for the National Assembly of Wales  and environmental organisations to have access to habitat status and change information on a Wales-only  basis in order to meet the requirements of country-specific environmental policy and legislation.      Welsh-only Estimates    The adjustments in CS2000 included the addition of some Welsh squares, bringing their number up to 64, and  making Wales the most intensively sampled of the three individual countries (England 0.22%, Scotland 0.24%  and Wales 0.29% of total land area). However, in regard to the precision of national estimates, which depends  on absolute numbers rather than proportions, the number of field survey squares in Wales is low compared to  the number in Scotland (203) and England (302).   A scoping report in 200642 concludes that the existing  number of 64 squares in Wales was not adequate for Wales-only reporting for the 2007 survey.  As a consequence, the following changes were made to the 2000 sampling framework for 2007:  •  Class sub-divisions – the ITE Land Classes have been sub-divided into the ‘country unit’ (England and  Wales) versions of the original land classes creating five new classes: 5w, 6w, 7w,15w,18w  •  Number of classes - the effect of the class sub-divisions is to create 45 strata instead of the earlier 40  •  Additional squares – to ensure that there is adequate representation of new classes in Wales, a total of  43 additional squares were surveyed in Wales, this gives a minimum of 6 squares in each Welsh class.  •  Additional squares in England to compensate for the removal of Welsh squares were not warranted.   Two of the English Classes (5e, 15e) are left with only 4 squares per class, however, the 2006 scoping  study42 states the reduction in precision of English estimates is relatively small and the small number of  squares in these classes should still be adequate for reporting purposes.

Estimates for GB for example can be  calculated either using the latest classification (effectively three separate classifications for the three countries)  or the original (1990) classification.  For consistency with in an individual survey the former approach is  preferred whilst the latter is more consistent across surveys’.  See table 4 for the sample numbers per survey  using the Original 1990 Land Classification.      Table 4.

Stable Isotope and U/Th Speleothem Measurements in Northern and Southern Vietnam, 200,000 – 334 years BP   Overview  Data This dataset includes carbon and oxygen stable isotopes together with top and bottom uranium-series ages of stalagmites collected in Northwest and Southern Vietnam. The stalagmites collected were found broken in-situ, and the exact location of the caves is not given here for cave protection purposes. The stalagmites were collected in 2023 and analysed during the same year.  Purpose The speleothems were collected to assess the suitability of the caves for palaeoclimatic reconstructions.  File information File format  The data files are in CSV format.  File naming convention The files for the stable isotope data follow the naming convention below:     The uranium-series data are included in the file vietnam_u_series_dates.csv.   File contents  Table 1. Description of variables in the vietnam_u_series_dates.csv  Table 1. Description of variables in the vietnam_BOI1_stable_isotopes_data.csv, vietnam_TH1_stable_isotopes_data.csv, vietnam_TH2_stable_isotopes_data.csv, vietnam_TB3_stable_isotopes_data.csv, vietnam_CS2_stable_isotopes_data.csv. Spatial coverage Samples BOI1, TH1 and TH2 were collected in the Ninh Binh province in northern Vietnam. Sample CS2 was collected in Kien Giang province in Southern Vietnam.   Temporal coverage  The oldest stalagmite is BOI1 which covers the period 200,719 - 187,631 years before present. The rest of the stalagmites are all Holocene, with ages between 7385 and 334 years before present. The samples were collected in February and March 2023.  Data acquisition and processing  Collection/Transformation methods  Broken stalagmites were collected from the cave floor and brought to the laboratory where they were cleaned with deionised water. The stalagmites were cut in half along the grows axis using a diamond wiresaw. Subsamples for stable isotopes and U-Th dating were collected using a computer-controlled micromill. The geochemical analyses were completed between April and December 2023.   Stable isotope values were calculated based on international standards NBS18 and IAEA60. U-Th ages are reported relative to 1950 CE and assume an atomic 230Th/232Th ratio of 4 (± 2) x 10-6. Samples were completely dissolved in diluted hydrochloric acid (HCl) and spiked with a 229 Th/ 233,236 U tracer, after which they were converted to nitric form by boiling nitric acid. The U/Th separations were conducted with extraction chromatography and the final U and Th fractions were measured using a multi collector inductively coupled mass spectrometer. Instrument data was exported to Microsoft Excel and then converted to CSV format.   Experimental design and methodology  For U-Th dating, between 150 and 200 miligrams of sample was collected from near the top and bottom of each stalagmite in order to establish the period of growth. U-Th ages are reported relative to 1950 CE and assume an atomic 230Th/232Th ratio of 4 (± 2) x 10-6. Briefly, samples were completely dissolved in diluted hydrochloric acid (HCl) and spiked with a 229 Th/ 233,236 U tracer, after which they were converted to nitric form by boiling nitric acid. The U/Th separations were conducted with extraction chromatography and the final U and Th fractions were measured using a Thermo Scientific Neptune MC-ICPMS. U-Th ages were obtained using the method outlined in Cheng, H. et al. (2013).   For stable isotope analyses, 85 – 110 micrograms  of carbonate powder was drilled along the growth axis of each stalagmite using a computer-controlled Sherline 2000 micromill. Measurements were done on a Thermo Delta V Advantage isotope ratio mass spectrometer coupled with a GasBench II and isotopic values were calculated based on international standards NBS18 and IAEA60, and reported on the VPDB scale.

To help get the most from your use of the data and guard against any  inappropriate use it is important that you familiarise yourself with the production  methodology, the associated metadata and the inherent limitations of the  different LCM2007 data products as described in the Final Report for LCM2007. 3    Introduction  Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007) is provided as a range of data products to support  the diverse requirements of the LCM user community. This report provides a brief  introduction to the LCM2007 data sets for users and those considering whether  LCM2007 fulfils their data needs. Although the LCM2007 data products are  described here it is highly recommended that the final report should be consulted for  a more comprehensive description and assessment of LCM2007 (Morton et al.,  2011).  Please note, this documentation only covers LCM2007 data products, for details  about LCM2000 and LCM1990 products please ensure you refer to the appropriate  dataset documentation.    Background  Land Cover Map 2007 is a parcel-based classification of UK land cover. It uses 23  classes to map the UK, which are based on the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP)  Broad Habitats. LCM2007 is created by classifying summer-winter composite images  captured by satellite sensors with 20-30m pixels. LCM2007 updates and upgrades  LCM2000, with the key improvement being the use of a spatial framework based on  generalised digital cartography (Ordnance Survey MasterMap topographic layer  (OSMM) for GB and Land & Property Services Large-scale Vector for Northern  Ireland), refined with image segments (see Morton et al., 2011 for details). LCM2007  is consequently constructed from polygons that clearly represent real-world objects,  such as fields and blocks of woodland. This enhances its compatibility with many  GIS data sets.    LCM2007 product specification  LCM2007 maps land cover (not land use)  LCM2007 maps land cover and whilst this may be synonymous with land use it will  not be in all cases. For example, an arable crop cover denotes arable land use, but  often land use cannot be inferred, as, for example, grass used for recreation looks  very similar to that which is grazed.    LCM2007 sets a minimum mappable area of >0.5 ha  Parcels less than 0.5ha and linear features less than 20m were dissolved into the  surrounding landscape during the production process.     LCM2007 classes  LCM2007 maps 23 classes (Table 1), which are based on the UKs terrestrial Broad  Habitats (Jackson et al., 2000). In some cases, the Broad Habitats can be reliably  divided further, based on their spectral signatures, so the:    ‘Built-up Areas and Gardens’ Broad habitat is divided into ‘Suburban’ and  ‘Urban’ classes. 4     ‘Dwarf Shrub Heath’ is divided into ‘Heather’ and ‘Heather grassland’ classes.   ‘Littoral Sediment’ Broad Habitat is divided into ‘Littoral sediment’ and  ‘Saltmarsh’ (a Priority Habitat).  LCM2007 is validated at the thematic resolution of the 23 LCM2007 classes. This is  the highest thematic resolution at which it is recommended the data is used.        LCM2007 has unique object labelling  During the production process each parcel is given a unique label which is stored in  the Parcel_ID attribute. All users of the LCM2007 vector products will receive data  containing this attribute. It is recommended that the Parcel_ID attribute is retained  within the LCM2007 data set and any developments of it. This will allow  unambiguous communication between LCM2007 users.      LCM2007 has rich metadata  During the production of LCM2007, like LCM2000 before it, information about  processing has been retained where possible. The LCM2007 vector data set  therefore has a rich set of metadata for each polygon. The polygon attributes provide  a record of the data sets involved in polygon construction, the Knowledge-based  enhancements (KBE) applied to the polygon and a probability list showing the top 5  spectral classes for the polygon.      LCM2007 validation using ground reference data  Ground reference data were collected to enable the validation of LCM2007 against a  set of data designed to match the spatial and thematic resolution of LCM2007. This  allowed LCM2007 to be compared against 9127 ground reference polygons  producing an average accuracy of 83%.      Please note: The accuracy above represents the average accuracy and so  represents a combination of higher and lower accuracy figures. Local discrepancies  may be observed which appear to suggest higher or lower accuracy rates: this is to  be expected. 5    LCM2007 product overview     LCM2007, like LCM1990 and LCM2000, is distributed in a range of data formats and  at a range of thematic and spatial resolutions. This range of products is required to  support a wide range of potential applications. Figure 1 shows a breakdown of the  different products and their respective spatial and thematic resolutions.                Figure 1. Diagram to show the available LCM2007 data products. 6    Example datasets  Figure 2 shows some examples of the data sets available for Land Cover Map 2007  and illustrates the level of detail associated with each product.  Spatially the vector  data set and the 25m raster data set are quite similar, however, the advantage of the  vector data set is that each polygon has a set of metadata attached. The  disadvantage of the vector is that this increases the file size and may make  processing unwieldy for some applications/users. The 25m raster data set maybe  useful in such circumstances, as it provides the same land cover detail, but without  the additional metadata information and polygon boundaries; this is more appropriate  for some applications. The 1km data sets are typically more appropriate for  applications modelling the whole of the UK and are often combined with additional  data sets, such as meteorological data set or species distribution data. By way of an  example, the Broadleaved woodland percentage land cover 1km raster product is  shown in Figure 3 - it shows the distribution of broadleaved woodland across the UK.  It is created by calculating the percentage of the 1km square covered by  Broadleaved woodland in the 25m raster data set.           Figure 2.

Vector Data Set  The vector data product is provided as polygons with each one having a list of  attributes attached to it. These include its area, source images, Broad Habitat, and  processing details, which includes polygon construction, original spectral  classification and KBE history (see Table 1). The vector data set contains 8.6 million  polygons for Great Britain and 0.9 million for Northern Ireland. LCM2007 contains 10  attributes for each polygon (Table 1).    Note: Broad Habitats sub-classes (BHSub attribute in vector data set: Table 1) and  Field Codes (FieldCode attribute in vector data set: Table 1) are included in the  vector data set. The BHSub field gives a text description of the FieldCode. Broad  Habitat sub-classes are used in the classification process and identify sub-LCM2007  class land cover types. The Broad Habitat sub-classes are aggregated to produce  LCM2007 classes (see Appendix 2 for details of groupings). Broad Habitat sub- classes may give additional information, but they are not necessarily recognised with  the accuracy or consistency of LCM2007 classes and Broad Habitats. They are  included in the data set primarily because they are included in the ProbList attribute  (described in Table 1), which gives the probability of the top five spectral classes  (named at Broad Habitat sub-class level). It is recommended that users apply their  own validation before using data at the Broad Habitat sub-class level if they wish to  use it, as it is not covered by the LCM2007 quality assurance. 8    Table 1. Description of the attributes of the LCM2007 vector data set.    Attribute  Description Parcel_ID  Unique parcel identifier for each parcel, which includes the satellite image the  polygon was derived from. Follows the format: 11853977:c20 where 11853977 is the  parcel id and c20 means the polygon came from composite image c20. Image  numbers may also begin with an ‘i’, e.g. i76, which signifies a single-date image. All  images are documented in Appendix 2 of Morton et al., (2011).  BH  Dominant land cover at Broad Habitat level e.g. Coniferous Woodland  BHSub  Broad Habitat sub-class (Appendix 2). Gives a text description of the FieldCode.  FieldCode  Short text string giving field codes. Note field codes are used in the creation of  LCM2007, but the accuracy of the product at this level is not assessed. The  LCM2007 team recommend that these codes are used only if users perform their  own validation on them.  INTCODE  RECOMMENDED FOR DISPLAY. This attribute gives the LCM2007 class as an  integer code from 1-23 (see Table 2). Note this is often referred to as LCM2007  class number. It is the class recommended for display and is the class validated by  the QA (Morton et al., 2011).  See appendix 3.  KBE  Knowledge-based enhancement (KBE). Descriptor detailing the processing history  of each segment including the complete list of KBE’s applied and the change  instigated by the KBE. The KBE notation follows a standard format of 2 or 3 letters  followed by a comma followed by original class and then the new class. E.g.     SL,Gr‐>Bg  signifies soil correction (SL) changing Rough Grassland to Bog. This would  occur when the polygon was on a bog soil, with no, or only slight, slope.    ALT,Sd‐>Gr signifies an altitude based correction (ALT) changing sand dune to Rough  Grassland. The change to Rough Grassland would be based on the next spectral class is  in the probability listing, as long as it was not a coastal class.  KBE identifiers:  MC - manual correction  SL - soil correction  CM - coastal mask  OM - offshore mask   UR - urban mask  ALT - altitude correction    ProbList  The probability of the polygon belonging to a spectral variant class. The attribute  lists the 5 spectral classes that closest match the spectral signature of the polygon   e.g. Gr_d,0.87:Gr_u,0.09:Hga_d,0.04:Gi_n,0.00:Gi_e,0.00 (Appendix 2).  CorePixels  Total number of pixels within the core area of the segment used to perform the  maximum likelihood classification.

Great Britain and Northern Ireland are provided in separate data sets  to allow for their different projections. Not all applications need the thematic  resolution of the complete set of LCM2007 classes, so LCM2007 has a defined set  of Aggregate classes, based on merging LCM2007 classes (Table 2). The Aggregate  classes are used for the 1km raster products.    25m raster: Consisting of 23 LCM2007 Classes. The relationship between pixel  value and corresponding LCM2007 class is shown in Table 2, with detail on the  extent of the data set and other metadata in Table 3. 10    1km raster: The 1km products for LCM2007 were created by summarising the  LCM2007 25m raster data set to produce percentage cover for each class and to  identify the dominant (most widespread) class in each 1km pixel (Table 3). The  products at 1km are:  -  Dominant cover at 1km for LCM2007 classes.  -  Dominant cover at 1km for LCM2007 Aggregate classes.  -  Percentage cover at 1km for LCM2007 classes.  -  Percentage cover at 1km for LCM2007 Aggregate classes.

Map projection  The LCM2007 vector and raster data sets for Great Britain and Northern Ireland data  sets are in the British National Grid and Irish National Grid projections respectively  (see Table 3 for details). Northern Ireland is in the process of switching over to the  new Ireland Transverse Mercator (ITM) projection and GIS packages should be able  to reproject the LCM2007 NI data to this projection if required.    File size  The vector data set contains almost 10 million polygons and each polygon has 10  attributes so consequently file sizes are large and this should be taken into account  when using LCM2007. The following file sizes are given for guidance (as file sizes  will vary with format, which in turn may vary depending on how the data is  accessed). The raster file sizes are for the geotiff format.

LCM2007 Classes  LCM2007  class  Brief Review  Broadleaved  woodland  Broadleaved woodlands are characterised by stands >5 m high with  tree cover >20%; scrub (<5 m) requires cover >30% for inclusion in  this BH. Such fine distinctions cannot be made through remote  sensing. Open-canopy woodland (stands with trees <50%) is a  particular problem, albeit occurring relatively rarely, and may not  often be mapped consistently, due to the dominance of the non- woodland plants. Stands with near-closed canopies can be  interpreted easily in the field and pure examples can normally be  found for training the classifier. Broadleaved evergreen trees (part of  this BH) rarely occur in stands >1ha (an area large enough to create  suitable training areas appropriate for classification). Mixed woodland  (with >20% broadleaved trees) was trained separately. Where  individual stands of broad-leaved or evergreen trees exceeded the  minimum mappable unit, they were treated as separate blocks within  the woodland; in many parts of the UK, truly ‘mixed woodlands’ as  opposed to those with mosaic-blocks of broadleaved and coniferous  trees, are unusual.   ‘Coniferous  Woodland’  ‘Coniferous Woodland’ includes semi-natural stands and plantations,  with cover >20%. The recognition of coniferous woodland is generally  straightforward. Rare examples of open canopy semi-natural  pinewoods may have been classified according to the dominant  understorey class. The BH includes new plantation and recently  felled areas (this is a class where the BH definition is based on land  use, i.e. forestry, rather than cover). New plantations, predominantly  heather and/or grass, for example, are recorded as such by the  spectral classification of image data. New plantations are only  consistently recorded as conifers when tree cover is sufficient to  strongly influence the reflectance. LCM2007 includes newly felled  areas. Once they are fully recolonised by rough grass, heath or  scrub, they are recorded according to that cover. Deciduous larch is  discernible from other deciduous trees and is generally correctly  included with other conifers.  ‘Arable and  Horticulture’  This Broad Habitat includes annual crops, perennial crops such as  berries and orchards and freshly ploughed land. Orchards with a  ground flora are hard to distinguish.   ‘Improved  Grassland’                  Improved grassland is distinguished from semi-natural grasslands  based on its higher productivity, lack of winter senescence and  location and/or context. In some cases heavy grazing can cause mis- classification with semi-natural grassland, or even arable land.    Some confusion occurs between ‘Improved Grassland’ and  ‘Calcareous Grassland’ and ‘Neutral Grassland’, as ‘Calcareous  Grassland’ and ‘Neutral Grassland’ are often very productive  grassland and so spectrally very similar to ‘Improved Grassland’. 13    ‘Neutral  Grassland’    In the production of LCM2007 grassland is mapped by classifying  images into ‘Improved Grassland’ and Rough grassland. The  knowledge-based enhancement rules determine whether Rough  grassland should be reclassified as ‘Neutral Grassland’, ‘Calcareous  Grassland’ or ‘Acid Grassland’, or whether it should remain as  Rough grassland.    In the field ‘Neutral Grassland’ is determined based on botanical  composition and it also includes semi-improved grasslands managed  for silage, hay or pasture (Jackson, 2000), which in LCM2007 will  often be classified as ‘Improved Grassland’.  ‘Calcareous  Grassland’    The same methods apply as for ‘Neutral Grassland’ (see above).  ‘Acid  Grassland’  The same methods apply as for ‘Neutral Grassland’ (see above).    Bracken can be mapped using LCM2007 methods, but it depends on  image timing and suitable training areas (bracken often fails to offer  stands sufficiently extensive for classification and training), so for  consistency it is assigned to ‘Acid Grassland’. However, some stands  of bracken can be identified at the subclass level.  Rough  grassland  The knowledge-based enhancement rules determine whether Rough  grassland should be reclassified as ‘Neutral Grassland’, ‘Calcareous  Grassland’ or ‘Acid Grassland’, or whether it should remain as  Rough grassland. The grass that remains as Rough grassland is  therefore a mix of areas of managed, low productivity grassland, plus  some areas of semi-natural grassland, which could not be assigned  Neutral, Calcareous or Acid grassland with confidence by the  knowledge-based enhancements.  Note about  grassland  classes  The comparisons between LCM2007 and other data sets (the ground  reference polygons and Countryside Survey in 2007 Broad Habitat  maps) (Morton et al., 2011), showed that ‘Neutral Grassland’ and  ‘Calcareous Grassland’ were often mis-classified as ‘Improved  Grassland’. Users requiring ‘Neutral Grassland’ and ‘Calcareous  Grassland’ should read Section 3.9 and Chapter 4 of the LCM2007  final report (Morton et al., 2011).  Other users may wish to aggregate  the grassland classes together, if appropriate to their needs.  ‘Heather’ and  ‘Heather  grassland’     (together form  the  ‘Dwarf Shrub  Heath’ Broad  Habitat)  ‘Dwarf Shrub Heath’ is divided into two classes, depending on the  density of Heather, producing ‘Heather’ and ‘Heather grassland’  classes respectively. This is similar to LCM1990's and LCM2000s  Open and Dense Shrub Heath classes.    Note: comparing LCM2007 to other data sets (ground reference data  set (Section 3.9 of Morton et al., 2011) and Countryside Survey in  2007 (Chapter 4 of Morton et al., 2011)) shows confusion over the  separation of ‘Bog’ and ‘Dwarf Shrub Heath’, however, this only  affects the separation of these two BHs and they are often difficult to  separate in the field.     Note, the Broad Habitat classification treats ericaceous vegetation  on peat > 0.5 m depth as ‘Bog’. A soil map showing peat-soils is  used to distinguish heaths from ericaceous bogs. 14    ‘Fen, Marsh  and Swamp’  ‘Fen, Marsh and Swamp’ includes fen, fen meadows, rush pasture,  swamp, flushes and springs. From a remote sensing perspective  ‘Fen, Marsh and Swamp’ is problematic as it is can be comprised of  a wide range of land cover types and many patches of Fen are below  the LCM2007 MMU. The small size of ‘Fen, Marsh and Swamp’  patches, plus their typically mosaic nature make it difficult to find  representative areas of sufficient size to conduct a spectral  classification. Soil data is of limited use in assisting as it shows the  historical land cover, so large swathes of East Anglia have a peaty,  fen soil, but subsequent drainage and management have changed  them to arable.   ‘Bog’  ‘Bog’ includes ericaceous, herbaceous and mossy swards in areas  with a peat depth > 0.5 m. ‘Bog’ forms part of an ecological  continuum covering ‘Acid Grassland’, ‘Dwarf Shrub Heath’ and some  types of ‘Fen, Marsh and Swamp’ and the separation of these  habitats can be difficult, as the surface vegetation (i.e. land cover)  maybe very similar and the division rests on the depth of peat. The  division in the field can account for species presence, plus peat  depth, but for LCM2007 the division is based on soil data sets.     Saltwater  Saltwater is mapped to a limited extent around the coastline of the  UK.  Freshwater      This is based on merging two freshwater BHs (‘Standing Open Water  and Canals’ and ‘Rivers and Streams’), as they cannot be reliably  separated from each other using the methods and data used for  LCM2007. In many cases small and/or narrow water bodies fall  below the MMU. Water bodies > 0.5 ha are readily mapped, as are  very wide rivers (>50 m).  ‘Montane  Habitats’  The montane distribution for LCM2007 is assigned based on altitude  (see Section 3.7 of Morton et al., 2011), whereas the Broad Habitat  definition is based on vegetation type. The Broad Habitat definitions  produced by JNCC note (Jackson, 2000) that if other habitats, such  as ‘Calcareous Grassland’ and ‘Bog’, occur within the ‘Montane  Habitats’ zone they should not be recorded as ‘Montane Habitats’. In  the production of LCM2007 it was not possible to determine whether  a ‘Montane Habitats’ reclassification based on altitude has greater  validity than the original spectral classification. This should be taken  into account by users interested specifically in the ‘Montane Habitats’  class.   LCM2007 above the montane altitude LCM2007 maps three Broad  habitats: ‘Montane Habitats’, Freshwater and ‘Inland Rock’.   ‘Inland Rock’  This Broad Habitat type covers both natural and artificial exposed  rock surfaces which are >0.25ha, such as inland cliffs, caves, screes  and limestone pavements, as well as various forms of excavations  and waste tips such as quarries and quarry waste. To be classified  as ‘Inland Rock’ the rock has to be the dominant spectral signature.  ‘Urban’ and  ‘Suburban’    (together form  the ‘Built-up  Within the ‘Built-up Areas and Gardens’ Broad Habitat LCM2007  recognises two categories that can be determined reliably: ‘Urban’  and ‘Suburban’. ‘Urban’ includes dense urban, such as town and city  centres, where there is typically little vegetation. ‘Urban’ also includes  areas such as dock sides, car parks and industrial estates. 15    Areas and  Gardens’  Broad Habitat)  ‘Suburban’ includes suburban areas where the spectral signature is a  mix of urban and vegetation signatures.  ‘Supra-littoral  Rock’  Features that may be present in this coastal class include vertical  rock, boulders, gullies, ledges and pools. Very limited areas are  mappable using satellite remote sensing.   ‘Supra-  littoral  Sediment’  This class includes sand-dunes, which are reliably mapped in this  class. Areas of coastal sand may be confused between this class  and the ‘Littoral sediment’ class.   ‘Littoral Rock’  These classes are those in the maritime mask zone on a rocky  coastline. They are generally more extensive than supra-littoral rock  and thus more readily mappable from satellite images.   ‘Littoral  sediment’ and  ‘Saltmarsh’    (together form  the ‘Littoral  Sediment’  Broad Habitat)  Littoral sediment is mapped as two classes: ‘Saltmarsh’ and ‘Littoral  sediment’. Saltmarsh is a Priority Habitat and of sufficient extent and  spectral distinction to be mapped consistently. The remaining ‘Littoral  Sediment’ is mapped spectrally, although there maybe some  confusion with the ‘Supra-littoral sediment’ class. 16    Appendix 2: Relationship between Broad Habitats, LCM2007 classes and Broad Habitat sub- classes for LCM2007.

Introduction    The Countryside Survey programme field records for land-cover and landscape features are held by the  Centre for Ecology & Hydrology in hard copy format. These data have been collected at varying intervals  (1977/78, 1984, 1990, 1998/99 and 2007) in Great Britain to form a globally unique long-term, large-scale  monitoring dataset.    The data from 1984, 1990 and 1998 were scanned as part of a previous project (CS2000 FOCUS - Scoping  and Pilot study for scanning Countryside Survey primary field data documents).  The linework for these years  was digitised prior to 2000, and the 2007 data were recorded directly onto rugged field computers.  However, the 256 annotated land-cover maps for the 1978 Countryside Survey squares had never been  digitised into a GIS format before 2009 (although the areas and lengths had been recorded using rudimentary  digitising tools in the 1980s). Before this data rescue project was undertaken, these primary source records of  long-term monitoring of land-cover and landscape features from the 1978 Countryside Survey programme  were at considerable risk of damage, loss or destruction. In addition, the data were unavailable in a spatial  form as a resource on a daily basis to CEH staff or to a wider range of researchers.  The Countryside Survey  1978 Data Rescue project has allowed digitisation of the maps, which provide the ability to analyze  Countryside Survey data in relation to Broad Habitat categories as far back as 1978, which was previously not  possible.    Converting the 1978 Countryside Survey land-cover maps into digital form effectively adds a completely new  survey dataset for land-cover to the existing surveys carried out in 1984, 1990, 1998 and 2007.  For the first  time, this allows us to extend the time series of matched vegetation and Broad Habitat data back to a critical  period that coincides with the culmination of post-WWII intensification of agriculture. This increases the  reliability and power of the entire time-series for estimating stock and change in Broad Habitats across the full  thirty year period. It will also provide new information on the impact of land-use as a driver of ecological  variation in plant species composition and soils in 1978.   During the project, the field codes used in 1978 were allocated to BAP Broad Habitats (Jackson, 2000) and  individual areas were scrutinised to enable consistency between the 1978 dataset and data from later years’  surveys. It is now possible to characterise the mosaic of broad habitats as they existed across GB thirty years  ago, in terms of coincident plant species and soil data (pH and Loss on Ignition) recorded at the same time.    This report incorporates a summary of work completed on the dataset and also comments and discussions  made at a Workshop in Grange-over-Sands and project meetings involving Colin Barr, Bob Bunce, David  Howard, Simon Smart, Claire Wood, and Peter Henrys (CEH project NEC03689, 2009-2011).      2. History of the 1978 Survey and Background to Data    A preliminary ecological survey was undertaken in Cumbria in the mid-1970s (Bunce and Smith, 1978)  following an earlier, smaller successful survey in Shetland.  These surveys consisted of vegetation plots only  (16 plots per 1km square).  For further details, refer to Firbank et al. (2003).     Building upon these smaller surveys, the Great Britain survey of 1978 planned to study eight randomly located  vegetation plots per 1km square.  This total was then reduced down to five for reasons of efficiency with  additional plots to represent rivers, roads and hedges.  A problem arose in that the plots could not guarantee  to capture variation across all the habitats in a survey square. On the field survey training course in 1977 it  was suggested that mapping areas of habitats would address this issue.  The field handbook from 1978 has a  paragraph explaining the methodology for doing this (refer to paragraph entitled ‘Sketch Map’ in the 1978 field  survey handbook (Barr and Bunce, 1978)).   The first few habitat maps were hand drawn sketches on blank  paper, then later transferred onto Ordnance Survey 1:10 000 base maps.  The sketches and field maps were  transferred onto the base maps using a set of 80 codes (refer to Appendix ii) which were mainly species 4  Countryside Survey: Measuring Habitat Change over 30 years - Final Report   descriptions but were based on traditionally taught divisions which, in most cases, have helped them translate  easily to Broad Habitats (Jackson, 2000) and in some cases, Priority Habitats (BRIG, 2007).    3.  Issues to address regarding the 1978 Dataset    By digitising this dataset and making it possible to use alongside other Countryside Survey datasets, certain  issues have arisen in the years following the 1978 survey which must be addressed.    1) One such issue was a worry that the data might not be consistent (both internally, in terms of recording  differences between surveyors (and their development during survey), and with mapping done in following  surveys).  This has been addressed by visually comparing the datasets against other years’ survey data  (see section 5).  The comparisons showed that the data are highly consistent and real change can be  reliably identified.     2) It has been suggested that a clear source of bias was introduced when the field sheets were transferred  and coded to base maps (introducing error from interpretation rather than recording surveyors’  observations).  However, it could be said that similar bias was introduced when digitisers played a similar  role in later Countryside Surveys, and at least in 1978, the bias was introduced consistently by one  person.    3) Concern has been expressed there was no quality assurance at the time of the survey to assess the  quality of the habitat surveying.  Again, this has been addressed by scrutinising the 1978 dataset in  comparison with species data and later survey data (see section 5).       Notwithstanding any of these criticisms, the data (in a non-spatial form) have been used in several models  and projects since 1978 indicating the data are robust.  In the 1980s, the NERC Experimental Cartography  Unit (ECU) suggested ways of doing overlay analysis studies and these suggestions gave rise to (among  others - refer to p121, Bunce et al., 1993):     •  Landscape Changes in Britain – Identifying changes in habitats between 1978 and 1984 (Barr et al.,  1986)  •  The Wood Energy project – Converting grassland areas into yield classes for potential wood  plantations (Mitchell et al.,1982)   •  LUAM (Land Use Allocation Model) (Jones et al., 1995)    The original analysis procedure involved quantifying areas with a measuring tool and tabulating the figures.   These tabulated sheets still exist at CEH Lancaster. National estimates were calculated using these  tabulated figures and were published in Bunce and Heal (1984) and also the Countryside Survey 1990  Report (Barr et al., 1993) (refer to Section 8).  Changes between 1978 and 1984 were investigated after a  second survey was undertaken (Barr et al., 1986). 5 Countryside Survey: Measuring Habitat Change over 30 years - Final Report     4. Digitization Procedure    Firstly, the maps were scanned on an auto-feed scanner at CEH Lancaster and are available in .jpg format  and .pdf format.  As there are now electronic backups, the original maps were removed from storage in a fire  safe and are now stored in the FAB (field assessment booklet) boxes, alongside the other years’ data. Plot  data sheets have also been scanned and placed in the FABs.1    The maps were then digitized by ADAS in summer 2009, according to the protocol set out in Appendix ii of  CS1978 – Data Rescue Scoping study for digitizing Countryside Survey primary field data documents, Final  Report (Wood, 2008).  The maps are now stored in a Geographical Information System based at CEH  Lancaster.    5. Data Checking and Validation    In the first instance, the data were checked for any obvious omissions, queries or errors arising from the  digitizing process in comparison with the original field maps.    Once these anomalies were remedied, it was necessary to check for any inconsistencies in the 1978 dataset  versus other years’ survey data.  In order to do this, each survey square for each survey year was arranged  onto individual sheets (see example in figure 1 below).                                                 This enabled changes in the data between 1978 and other years to be identified.  With the help of staff who  were involved with the 1978 survey, maps were assessed to see whether changes between 1978 and other  years were real changes or changes due to error.  This was achieved by checking plot data and original  species data recorded on the maps.  After having undergone this process, it was felt that the 1978 dataset had  levels of quality and consistency comparable that of the other Countryside Survey datasets, allowing direct  comparisons of change to be undertaken at a future date.  Further examples of squares illustrating land use  change can be seen in figure 2.      1 Scanned sheets can be found in: S:\PARR Section\LUS\resources\CS_digital_images\CEH\[Sq_no]\1978  Figure 1.

Note the location of CS field survey squares is not disclosed to maintain the scientific integrity and  relevance of CS. Consequently, the squares in Figure 1 have been spatially manipulated to prevent  identification of the square’s location. 1978 1984 1990 1998 2007 6  Countryside Survey: Measuring Habitat Change over 30 years - Final Report                                                                                                             Survey square showing an area of Acid Grassland and Dwarf Shrub Heath in 1978 being replaced with conifer  plantations by 1990 – a typical scenario reflecting an increase in forest planting since the late 1970s.  By 2007, an area  of fen in the top left corner has grown in size, and there are signs that grassland improvement has taken place.   A typical lowland survey square showing few major changes between 1978 and 2007.  The square illustrates changes  from Improved Grassland to Arable and Horticulture and vice versa.  Similar squares of this Land Class type also appear  to show a downward trend in areas of Improved Grassland.       A survey square showing a range of small changes.   There is increased urbanisation, increased conifer and broad leaf  planting and changes between grassland types.  Again, the increased urbanisation and woodland planting are changes  which may be seen in many survey squares.

Consequently, the squares in Figure 2 have been spatially manipulated to prevent identification of the  square’s location.  Figure 2.

Broad Habitat Allocations     Whilst the majority of the 1978 codes were straightforward to translate to BAP Broad Habitats (e.g. 1978 Code  56: Conifer Woodland = BH 2 Coniferous Woodland), there were a few categories which proved problematic  (e.g 1978 Code 69: Mixed Upland Moor could be Bog, Dwarf Shrub Heath or Acid Grassland) (see appendix ii  for full code lists).  For areas with ambiguous allocations, the original habitat maps (annotated with species)  and vegetation plot data where possible, were used to clarify the correct Broad Habitat allocation.  A visual  check of every square was essential to resolve any issues.    6.1 Issues arising from the 1978 Broad Habitat Allocations    •  Upland codes proved to be the more difficult codes to delineate and allocate to Broad Habitats. However,  this issue is not confined to the 1978 dataset and these habitats can be inherently difficult to delineate in  areas of heterogeneous upland landscape; habitats may be spatially indistinguishable or within a wider  area patches may be smaller than the minimum mappable unit.  In later surveys, areas such as this could  be defined as a ‘Mosaic’ by surveyors (Maskell et al., 2008).      •  Code 23: Herb rich pasture was used in 1978 to define Calcareous Grassland.  However, this code might  also have been used for Acid Grassland or even Dwarf Shrub Heath.  Areas of Calcareous Grassland  were scrutinised in comparison to other years’ maps and with reference to vegetation plot data where  possible in order to identify the areas correctly.     •  Areas of Inland Rock are overestimated in 1978, as in 1978 the code was a primary code whereas in later  years it became possible to record rock as a secondary code.  Differences are also partly due to  differences in the methodology for mapping cliffs (lines seen from above vs. surface area).  This will be  reflected in any calculations of national estimates for 1978.    •  1978 code translation to Neutral and Improved Grassland were not straightforward.  Reference to  vegetation plot data and notes were used where possible to define the areas correctly.      •  During digitization, the CS2000 area and line maps were all interpreted with 1984 and 1990 maps to  produce a single set of line work (so as to avoid slivers in data).  The 2007 data were largely based on the  1998 line work.  Hence the 1984, 1990, 1998 and 2007 datasets are very similar in terms of line work.   Conversely, the 1978 dataset was digitised independently.  Despite this, after scrutinising the datasets, it  is apparent that the 1978 line work is highly consistent with the other datasets.    •  In certain cases, Priority Habitats (BRIG, 2007) could also be identified.  These include Coastal Saltmarsh,  Blanket Bog and Purple Moor Grass Rush Pasture. 8  Countryside Survey: Measuring Habitat Change over 30 years - Final Report   7. Note Regarding the ITE Land Classifications    In 1978, the method of locating sample squares and the method for the production of national estimates used  the original ITE Land Classification (Bunce et al., 1981).  Squares on the intersection of a 15 x 15 km square  grid across Britain were classified in this original classification (1215 of the 1228 squares were classified –  although that includes some just off the coast that were moved to the nearest land).  Indicator Species  Analysis (ISA) generated a key that was used to classify a further 4,824 squares distributed around those  originally classified, producing 6,039 used for analysis.  The areas of Land Class were based on areas of the  country as a proportion to these classified squares.  The reason for the sampling approach was not only the  constraints of computing and analytical power (matrix algebra with potential 250,000 x 80 variables), but also  that data had to be collected by hand.  With a few exceptions, only the original 1215 squares were used for  survey square selection (256 in 1978, 384 in 1984, 508 in 1990, 569 in 1998 and 591 in 2007).  At a simple  level, the procedure for calculating national estimates of habitat areas involved using the surveyed data to find  the mean amount of habitat per 1km square in a Land Class, multiplying this mean by the Land Class area,  then summing these totals for Great Britain as a whole.    The first ‘All Squares’ classification was derived in the 1980s and was improved for the 1990 survey using  Ralph Clarke’s twin analytical approach (Barr et al., 1993).  The reclassification was conservative, using the  original as a training set and seeking to match this classification.  For 1998, the Scottish land classes were  separated (32 to 40 classes) and for 2007, Wales was isolated (to 45 classes) (Barr, 1998; Bunce et al.,  1996a; Bunce et al., 1996b; Howard et al., 1998).  Refer to Appendix iii for a summary flowchart of the  evolution of the Land Classification. 9 Countryside Survey: Measuring Habitat Change over 30 years - Final Report   8. Results: National Estimates of Broad Habitat Stock 1978    National estimates of stock for Great Britain have been calculated for a selection of Broad Habitats for the  1978 survey (habitats shown are those reported in the 2007 survey report2 (Carey et al., 2008)).    It is important to note that these estimates are not directly comparable to those for later surveys published in  the Countryside Survey report for 2007 (Carey et al., 2008).  This is primarily for two reasons; the first being    that due to the limited sample size of 256 1km survey squares, estimates have been calculated using the 1990  ITE Land Classification (with 32 classes) rather than the revised 2007 Land Classification (with 45 classes)  (see section 7), as there are statistically not enough sample survey squares per class with 45 classes.   Secondly, due to the way Broad Habitats have been allocated retrospectively (as is also the case with data  from 1984 and 1990), habitats may not necessarily equate directly to the later datasets.    It is not within the scope of this report to comment on the significance of the estimates in comparison with later  years’ results; it is intended further work will focus on this in the future.  When considering calculating change  between 1978 and later years using the consistent statistical model used for calculating the 2007 results, it  must be noted that the addition of an additional dataset (1978) to the time series will create minor changes to  the results published for later years in 2008 (Carey et al., 2008).  Also, the revised 2007 Land Classification  cannot be used to calculate change from 1978-2007 due to the lack of samples in certain classes in 1978.

In many cases, the Broad Habitat classes reported here were not directly comparable with the  Reporting Classes (see footnotes for table 2) used in the previous publications (both of which used  slightly different aggregations of classes), making comparisons difficult.  This is especially the case  with the grassland categories (Neutral, Improved, Acid, Calcareous) and upland categories (Dwarf  Shrub Heath, Bog).    2. In some cases, the polygon codes used in 1978 proved difficult to allocate to a specific Broad Habitat  class (see Appendix ii and Section 6), resulting in variations in the national estimates for these classes.   Additionally, during the comparison process with later data, certain 1978 areas may have been edited  to be consistent with later data where it was obvious (with reference to available species data) that no  real change had taken place.  This means the new dataset analysed in 2011 has slight differences to  the original data analysed.    3. One major difference is that Bunce and Heal (1984) used the original ITE Land Classification created in  1978, whereas the results published here used the revised ‘All Squares’ Land Classification created in  1990 (also used in Barr et al., 1993).  In light of this, it should be expected that the new results  published here have more similarity to those published in Barr et al., (1993) than to those in Bunce and  Heal (1984).      8.1.1 Notes regarding Specific Habitats    In table 2, it can be seen that certain of the previously published data (Bunce and Heal, 1984; Barr et al.,  1993) are outwith the limits calculated from the rescued dataset.  These values are highlighted in red.   Possible reasons for the discrepancies are put forward below.     Boundary and Linear Features  The published estimate in Bunce and Heal (1984) is higher than the upper limit published here.  The difference  is likely to be explained by the different (1978) Land Classification used in Bunce and Heal (1984) which is  known to have a tendency to overestimate smaller habitats (Howard et al., in prep).    Arable and Horticulture  The new mean estimate is higher than both of the previous estimates, with the Bunce and Heal (1984)  estimate falling below the lower limit.  Again this will be largely due to the version of Land Classification used  in analysis.    Acid Grassland, Dwarf Shrub Heath, Fen, Marsh and Swamp, Bog  These classes are perhaps the most difficult to compare due to the different reporting classes in each of the  publications.  Confusions between these classes explain any differences between the published results.     Fen, Marsh and Swamp  The Bunce and Heal (1984) value is above the upper limit for the rescued data.  As with the Boundary and  Linear Features habitat, this can be explained by the use of the 1978 Land Classification overestimating the  results of a small habitat type.  Additionally, the Fen, Marsh and Swamp category is not well defined in the  published 1978 results.  The value for ‘Juncus dom.’ has been selected as the closest to a fen category.   However, this is likely to include areas of grassland, thus inflating the estimate.     Urban  The urban figure from Bunce and Heal (1984) includes the unsurveyed urban land, excluded from the other  estimates.  Unsurveyed urban land was not taken into account in the original 1978 Land Classification and  therefore is not published separately in Bunce and Heal (1984).  When the Land Classification was improved  in 1990, urban land and sea corrections were taken into account (see Barr et al., 1993).  Therefore  unsurveyed urban land became a constant value at 482 000 ha. 12  Countryside Survey: Measuring Habitat Change over 30 years - Final Report   9. References     Barr, C.J. and Bunce, R.G.H.

To understand exactly how the present Countryside Survey sampling framework has been derived, it is  important to review the concepts and activities that have evolved over the last 30 years since the first survey  was carried out.  It is possible that if the earlier time-series data were not so valuable as a basis for detecting  change, and a fresh start could be made today, then a different sampling strategy might be well be adopted.   However, the present Countryside Survey methodology is inextricably linked with its predecessors and an  understanding of these is essential.    Early development of the ITE Land Classification  The beginning  In the early 1970s, the idea of widespread ecological survey of areas as big as Great Britain was barely  conceivable.  However the concept of ecological sampling at a smaller scale (e.g. individual woodlands), was  commonly accepted and it was Bunce and Shaw13 who developed local regional survey into a national  ecological sampling system.  The important part of the approach was that the sampled areas should be  representative of the whole region and, to ensure this, they employed a stratification system.  The importance of a stratified system  In order to avoid bias in the selection of samples (thereby potentially invalidating the results), any sample  should be based on objective (e.g. random) selection procedures.  However, purely random sampling  programmes run the risk of selecting, by chance, a number of samples which are at one extreme in a range of  variability and therefore not ‘typical’ of the whole population being sampled.  An extreme example would be  where a national opinion poll, by chance, only included teenagers in the sample - their voting intentions may  not be representative of the voting population at large.    To minimise this risk, stratification systems are used to ‘carve up’ the population into discreet layers, or strata,  so that all parts of the population are sampled.  In the analogy above, most national opinion polls sample  within different age strata.  In ecological terms, it is likely that different species and ecological processes occur  in different types of land.  A simple stratification might then divide the land surface into different altitude ranges  so that uplands and lowlands, which tend to have different ecological characteristics, are adequately sampled.  However, this represents a very simple stratification and, just as opinion polls attempt to sample not just  different age strata but also those concerned with gender, social, racial and regional backgrounds, so other  factors are important in ecological survey.  Land at a certain altitude in north-east Scotland may have different 3 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007)  The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey   ecological affinities to land at the same altitude in East Anglia.  Thus other, secondary strata may need to be  introduced.  If this argument is extended to its logical conclusion, then it can be seen that many different strata  may need to be created by combining a number of different determining factors.  This is the theoretical basis  of the ITE Land Classification.    Development of the first version of the ITE Land Classification system.  In the early 1970s, Bunce and Shaw carried out a sample survey of the Lake District National Park.  They had  spent several years surveying and classifying vegetation in woodlands13 and elsewhere; this depended on  recording plant species in square plots (quadrats) and then classifying the quadrats into groups (vegetation  types) depending on which species were present.  Thus, all the quadrats in one group tended to have more or  less similar species present while those in another group had different species.  They used a multivariate  classification system called Indicator Species Analysis (ISA)35 to group the quadrats.  Bunce and Shaw  realised that the same approach could be ‘scaled up’ to classify areas of land, except that the quadrats would  be larger (eg a 1 km square) and, instead of using species as the basis of classifying, they would use  environmental attributes (such as altitude, geology and climate).  The work was pioneered in the Lake District  National Park and then extended and tested in Cumbria14, Lancashire and other regions of GB.  In 1975, the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology (ITE), capitalising on the potential of the approach, provided  funding for a national ecological survey of GB.  The survey had two major prerequisites:  •  it should be carried out using field survey (in order to obtain the level of ecological information required),   •  it should be carried out within a single field season.  As a result of the earlier work in Cumbria and elsewhere, it was thought that the sample unit of a 1km square  was appropriate, being small enough to survey in a reasonable period of time and yet large enough to contain  sufficient environmental features to allow differentiation of squares.  With over 240,000 1km squares in GB, a  sampling approach was an obvious necessity and a stratified, random sampling system was then developed –  the ITE Land Classification was born.  In the mid-1970s, when this work was being done, computing power was such that software packages like ISA  could only operate on a limited number of datasets.  Thus it was not possible to create a classification of all 1  km squares in GB and an alternative strategy had to be found.  By taking the centre square of a 15 x 15 km  grid across GB, a suitable number of squares was identified for classification (1228).  Environmental,  physiographic and other mapped data were then collected for each of the 1228 squares and the dataset was  analysed using ISA to produce 32 classes (Table 1).  Four squares surrounding each of the classified squares  were also allocated to classes using the key provided by ISA; thus a total of 6040 squares were classified  (Figure 1).  Full details of this procedure can be found in Bunce et al6 and Bunce et al7.  The 32 classes were  then described based on the average values of the environmental characteristics that were used to generate  the classes (for example, average altitude, slope and rainfall, and host of other environmental values).    The sampling framework for the first ecological survey of GB in 1978  Having generated the classification which would act as the sampling stratification system, the number of  samples to be surveyed was considered.  Ideally, this number would depend on the size of the stratum (ie how  many 1 km squares of the class occurred in GB) and on the ecological variability within the stratum.  Previous  work had suggested that for ecological surveys of this type, at least eight samples per stratum were  necessary.  Since this was the minimum requirement for each class, and resources were not available to  survey more squares, then eight were selected at random from each of the classes.  These squares were  taken from the grid of classified squares and thus the final sample for the first GB survey was a gridded,  stratified, random sample of 256 1 km squares.  The survey was actually carried out in the summers of 1977  (when a few pilot squares were sampled) and 1978 and focussed on vegetation quadrats and soils; habitat  areas were also mapped. 4 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007) The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey Table 1.

Map of ‘original’ (1978) ITE Land Classification 6 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007) The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey   The sampling framework for the second, land use survey of GB in 1984  In 1984, ITE funded a further GB survey although, by this time, the emphasis had shifted away from ecological  features such as soils and plant species in quadrats, to land use, landscape features and habitat mapping.   The same sampling framework was used as in 1978 but the sample size was increased by 50% so that 12  squares were surveyed in each of the 32 classes (including the eight squares previously visited).  With the  benefit of hindsight, there is an argument for having allocated the additional 128 new squares according to  land class size which would certainly have reduced the statistical error terms associated with national  estimates made from the sample.  However, this was not done.  Examples of change statistics between 1978  and 1984 were published in Barr et al.2    Application of the ITE Land Classification to Countryside Survey 1990   By 1990, and following the Ecological Consequences of Land Use Change (ECOLUC) programme carried out  by ITE on contract to the then Department of the Environment (DOE)3, both scientific and policy needs for a  further survey were identified.  Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990) was initiated with DOE, NERC, DTI and  NCC all contributing funding.  The first Land Cover Map of GB, derived from satellite imagery was also linked  to this programme.  Again, the ITE Land Classification was used as the sampling framework for a field survey but, in this third  survey, additional squares were allocated only to the larger land classes.  A total of 508 squares was surveyed  and all the features recorded in the 1984 survey, plus a repeat of the 1978 vegetation quadrats, was carried  out3.  The distribution of the squares within the Land Classes is shown in Table 2 and a map of sites is shown  as Figure 2.    Further development of the ITE Land Classification  CS1990 still used the original, gridded land classification that had been developed in the mid-1970s and  results were published based on the use of that system.  However, it became apparent that for estimations at  the regional and local level, the land classification had to be extended so that every square in GB was  classified.    Although computing power had increased considerably since the first classification, it was still an  insurmountable task to collect data for every square in GB at the same level of detail as had been done in the  original work.  Instead, the major climatic, geological and physiographic factors (or valid surrogates for these)  were obtained for each square and then a variety of multivariate classification procedures was tested on the  resulting dataset.  When the classes of the original sample of 1228 squares were compared with the new  classification attempts, the best simulation resulted in only a 62% correspondence.  However, all of the  squares that did not match exactly did fall into neighbouring land classes and the average characteristics of  the class remained unchanged, thus the classification was accepted as a reasonable replacement for its  earlier counterpart (Figure 3).    The net effect of this on the sampling framework was that as a result of some of the squares changing class,  the distribution across land classes was distorted and some classes were not well represented.  The effect of  this can be seen in column 3 of Table 2. 7 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007)  The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey   Figure 2.

Map of the ‘new’ (1990) ITE Land Classification. 9 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007)  The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey   Developments of the ITE Land Classification for Countryside Survey 2000  During the planning stages of Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000), there was consideration of sample  numbers in connection with several of the component modules.  This involved re-assessment of the existing  (CS1990) sample as well as the need for additional 1 km squares.  A number of issues have arisen from an  independent appraisal of CS1990 for policy purposes.  These include:  •  the effects of the changed ITE Land Classification.  •  the need to produce separate reliable estimates of surveyed features for Scotland and England with  Wales,  •  the need to provide statistically reliable estimates of upland habitats in England and Wales.  The new ITE Land Classification  As discussed above, the application of the new ITE Land Classification has resulted in some classes being  under-represented.  To correct this imbalance, a number of new squares were included as part of CS2000; the  details of how these are allocated are presented below, under ‘Separate country estimates’.  Separate country estimates  In CS1990, 508 1 km squares were sampled in England, Scotland, Wales and the Isle of Man.  The sample of  squares was drawn at random from a grid of squares in the 32 ITE Land Classes.  As described above, these  classes were created using underlying environmental attributes and therefore crossed country (E, S & W)  boundaries.  Country estimates were derived from the mean characteristics of all squares in each class,  irrespective of their country location.  A CS2000 Scoping Study34 recommended that the sampling framework should be modified to enable reporting  on ‘country units’, being (a) England with Wales and (b) Scotland, separately using only squares which lie in  the country for which estimates are to be made.  Additional samples have been deployed to assist with this requirement and the following changes have been  made to the sampling framework:  • class sub-division - the ITE Land Classes have been sub-divided into the ‘country unit’ versions of the  original classes,  • class aggregation - where this has resulted in there being very few squares of any particular class  remaining in a country, then this ‘rump’ has been aggregated with a similar class in that country (the net effect  of the class sub-divisions and aggregations is to create 40 strata, instead of the earlier 32),  • additional squares - to ensure that there is adequate representation of all new classes in each country unit,  19 additional squares have been allocated and this gives a minimum of 6 squares in each new class.  To  ensure relatively consistent sampling rates between England and Wales, a further 11 squares (5 in England  and 6 in Wales) have been allocated,  • Land Class 17 - Wales is dominated by Land Class 17 and to help refine the results reported for Wales, a  sub-division of Land Class 17 has been carried out in Wales.  In the allocation of any new squares in Wales  (either detailed above or in any further options), representation of the new sub-classes has been respected.  • Isle of Man – the two sample squares in the IOM included in previous surveys do not contribute to  estimates for ‘country units’ and are replaced by two new squares in England.  The revised land class maps for England with Wales and for Scotland are shown as Figure 4. 10 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007) The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey Figure 4.  Map of revised ITE Land Classes in ‘England with Wales’ and in Scotland – the  sampling framework for CS2000 11 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007)  The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey   Survey of uplands in England and Wales  An additional module within CS2000, funded by DETR, MAFF, and WO/CCW, included surveying an  additional 30 squares which have been placed in ITE Land Classes which occur in the uplands and marginal  uplands of England and Wales.  This gives better statistical accuracy to the estimates of habitats in the uplands of England and Wales which,  due to the need to provide separate, country-based estimates, would otherwise be under-sampled.

Since devolution, there has been an increasing need for the National Assembly of Wales  and environmental organisations to have access to habitat status and change information on a Wales-only  basis in order to meet the requirements of country-specific environmental policy and legislation.      Welsh-only Estimates    The adjustments in CS2000 included the addition of some Welsh squares, bringing their number up to 64, and  making Wales the most intensively sampled of the three individual countries (England 0.22%, Scotland 0.24%  and Wales 0.29% of total land area). However, in regard to the precision of national estimates, which depends  on absolute numbers rather than proportions, the number of field survey squares in Wales is low compared to  the number in Scotland (203) and England (302).   A scoping report in 200642 concludes that the existing  number of 64 squares in Wales was not adequate for Wales-only reporting for the 2007 survey.  As a consequence, the following changes were made to the 2000 sampling framework for 2007:  •  Class sub-divisions – the ITE Land Classes have been sub-divided into the ‘country unit’ (England and  Wales) versions of the original land classes creating five new classes: 5w, 6w, 7w,15w,18w  •  Number of classes - the effect of the class sub-divisions is to create 45 strata instead of the earlier 40  •  Additional squares – to ensure that there is adequate representation of new classes in Wales, a total of  43 additional squares were surveyed in Wales, this gives a minimum of 6 squares in each Welsh class.  •  Additional squares in England to compensate for the removal of Welsh squares were not warranted.   Two of the English Classes (5e, 15e) are left with only 4 squares per class, however, the 2006 scoping  study42 states the reduction in precision of English estimates is relatively small and the small number of  squares in these classes should still be adequate for reporting purposes.    The revised class map for England, Wales and Scotland is shown in figure 6. 15 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007)  The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey   Figure 6.

Estimates for GB for example can be  calculated either using the latest classification (effectively three separate classifications for the three countries)  or the original (1990) classification.  For consistency with in an individual survey the former approach is  preferred whilst the latter is more consistent across surveys’.  See table 4 for the sample numbers per survey  using the Original 1990 Land Classification.      Table 4.

Carbon and nitrogen contents of soil organic matter fractions, soil organic carbon, total soil nitrogen, and soil organic matter of 100 topsoil samples from the UKCEH Countryside Survey, Great Britain, 2019-2020  Soil organic matter fractions Organic matter in soil (SOM) is highly heterogeneous, creating organic matter pools within the soil that may have very different residence time. Modelling its dynamics requires considering these different organic matter pools (Gärdenäs et al., 2011). Conceptual models suggest that the stability of SOM depends on the source of plant litter, occlusion within aggregates, incorporation in organo-mineral complexes and location within the soil profile. Density fractionation is a methodology that separates organic debris residing outside (free light fraction = LF) and inside the aggregates (occluded particulate light fraction = OF) from the mineral associated organic matter (MAOM fraction) providing the opportunity to study physical and chemical stabilization mechanisms (Golchin et al., 2018; Six et al., 1998; Sohi et al., 2001, 2005). A fourth fraction is the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) which moves with the water either down in the soil profile or laterally with run-off during big rain events. In the last decade, there has been an increase in dissolved organic matter concentrations across Europe and North America attributed to DOC leaching from soils (Monteith et al., 2007). A density fractionation procedure was used that separated SOM into discrete fractions of differing stability; these pools are similar to the most frequently used in turnover models (Figure 1): 1.

All fractions are expressed in g-soil/kg-soil (air dry wt). Here, the DOC and OF fraction were discarded, and only the LF and MAOM fractions were analysed for their carbon and nitrogen contents. The OF fraction was derived via mass balance. Soil samples were selected from the UKCEH Countryside survey years 2019 and 2020. Samples are analysed for general soil metrics and are reported elsewhere (Bentley et al. 2023a, Bentley et al. 2023b).  Background to the UKCEH Countryside Survey Countryside Survey is a unique study or “audit” of the natural resources of the UK’s countryside. The Survey has been carried out at regular intervals since 1978. The countryside is sampled and studied using rigorous scientific methods, allowing us to compare results from 2019+ with those from previous surveys. In this way, we can detect the gradual and subtle changes that occur in the countryside over time. A series of reports have been published outlining the main findings for UK and individual countries. The most recent full survey was conducted in 2007 (Emmett et al., 2010) with components of the soils research published in Reynolds et al (2013) and Keith et al. (2020). The UKCEH Countryside Survey starting in 2019 marks the start of a new phase of Countryside Survey, which has adopted a rolling program of monitoring carried out annually from 2019 to 2023. The 2019 (and subsequent) surveys are supported by NERC under the UK-SCAPE national capability program. It provided a science platform to address the overarching question: What is the direction and magnitude of change in soil condition and function across the UK and how do multiple pressures interact to create the spatial and temporal patterns observed? Soil health is fundamental for food security, public health and understanding the climate system. The national research platform UK-SCAPE will address a critical gap in our understanding of soil status and dynamics at the national scale by transforming previous surveys since 1978 (Keith et al. 2020) through a new rolling sampling programme to provide data and maps of stock and change in GB soils, taking primary measurements of topsoil condition which influence soil function which are co-located with vegetation assessments.  Introduction to the Countryside Survey design and the rolling programme The monitoring of the Countryside Survey was designed to capture multiple measures and metrics (Scott, 2008; Reynolds 2013), and to integrate across these metrics. Hence, a full ecosystem-based approach was required where data operating at multiple scales are captured, where possible, at the same time in a single snapshot visit. The original monitoring program has been reduced and currently focuses on soil and vegetation change. For the UKCEH Countryside Survey starting in 2019, a rolling survey was adopted that will repeat once a five-year cycle, or when 500 squares, have been completed. This is to identify change that occurs over that time period. The rolling programme is more practical and buffers the results against extreme years in terms of climate fluctuations. It ensures we maximise the number of sites visited across the national spatial scale whilst at the same time monitoring year-on-year, such that spatial variation and temporal changes and trends can be detected cost-effectively. A total of 500 x 1-km2 squares, over a five-year cycle, were randomly sampled within strata defined according to the Land Classification of Great Britain (Bunce et. al., 2018) – a derived classification of the landscape based on its topography, geology, climate, and physical attributes. 100 of these squares will be visited on an annual basis.     Any square randomly selected that contained more than 75% of urban land or that was more than 90% sea (defined by LCM2007 and the UK Census mean high tide data) was excluded.  Methods Sample collection Within each 1-km x 1-km square, topsoil samples were taken from up to 5 pre-determined randomly dispersed locations with the vegetation X-Plots. The soil samples analysed for soil metrics is taken using a black plastic core, 15 cm long, from a location co-incident with vegetation surveys. Soil organic matter density fractionation was performed on 100 archived soil samples (sieved to 2 mm and air dried) in spring 2022.  Loss-on-Ignition (LOI), hygroscopic water content, and CaCO3 content Hygroscopic water content, LOI and CaCO3 was measured on approximated 10 g archived sub-sample. Samples were loaded into a Thermo-Gravimetric Analyser (LECO TGA701) and heated from 25°C to 1000°C in four steps. The first step is when the furnace reaches 105°C, at that point the temperature is kept constant for 3 h. The soil weight loss of the sample at that temperature compared to 25oC gives the hygroscopic water content. Hygroscopic moisture fraction (g water per g soil) = (TGA_AIRDRY_SOIL - TGA_105)/TGA_105 In the second step, samples are heated to 375°C and sustained at a constant temperature for a total of 15.45 h, the weight loss between 105°C and 375°C gives the Soil organic matter content as Loss-on-Ignition (LOI): SOM (g per 100 g) = LOI (g per 100 g, %) = 100*(TGA_105-TGA_375)/(TGA_105) SOM (g per g) = LOI (g per g, fraction) = LOI (g per 100 g) / 100 In the third step, samples were heated to 650°C and kept constant for 2 h, the weight loss between 375°C and 650°C is related to decomposition of clay mineral and other losses. In the final step, samples were heated to 1000°C and kept constant for another 3 h, the weight loss between 650°C and 1000°C gives the calcium carbonate content of the sample. The TGA instrument records the weight of the sample during the entire process. Data were exported at the end of the run with weight values for the sample at the beginning (initial soil weight), at 105°C after the 3.3 h, at 375°C at the end of the 15.45 h, at 650°C at the end of the 2 h, and at 1000°C at the end of the run.  The amount of calcium carbonate carbon content was calculated using the following steps: TEMP_Calcite (g per 100 g, %) = 100*(TGA_650 - TGA_1000)/(TGA_105) * 2.27 The factor 2.27 is obtained from the chemical equation for the decomposition of CaCO3 with temperature: CaCO3 = CaO + CO2 Where the weight loss of CaO3 is the molecular weight of the CaCO3 (100.0869) divided by the molecular weight of CO2 (44.01). The calcite concentration in each sample was corrected for variable CaCO3 recovery (95-100%, also see Quality control section below): Calcite (g CaCO3 per 100 g oven dry soil, %) = (TEMP_Calcite * 100)/TGA_STANDARD Calcite-C (g per 100 g, %) = (12.011/100) * Calcite Calcite-C (g per g) = Calcite-carbon (%) / 100 Soil Organic Matter (SOM) density fractionation: SOM fractionation was performed using sodium polytungstene (SPT), 990 g of SPT was dissolved into 810 mL of deionised water (DIW). The density of the SPT solution was checked using a hydrometer and adjusted as needed by adding water or more solid SPT until achieving 1.8 g cm-3. A subsample of 2.5 g of archived soil was weighted into a 50 mL falcon tube with 40 mL of 1.8 g cm-3 SPT. The tube was shaken for ½ h at 100 rpm and centrifuged at 2825 rpm for 30 min (Cotrufo et al., 2015). Again especial attention needs to be taken when soils show hydrophobicity before centrifugation. The supernatant with the light fraction of the organic matter was then filtered carefully to don’t disturb the pellet at the bottom of the tube into a filtering vacuum device with polyethersulfone 0.45 µm filters. DIW was used to rinse the SPT from the material in the filter until the electrical conductivity of the outcome filtered liquid was below 100 µS cm-1, except for calcareous soils where 200 µS cm-1 is acceptable (Schrumpf et al., 2013). The material in the filter was transferred to a pre-weighted pre-labelled aluminium boat using DIW. This boat was transferred in the oven at 105°C to evaporate the water. The final weight of the boat and the dried LF was recorded when dry to obtain the weight of LF-fraction. The remaining pellet in the falcon tube was re-suspended in another aliquot of 40 mL of 1.8 g cm-3 SPT using a vortex instrument. The tube was placed in an ice bath to keep the temperature of the suspension below 40°C (Schrumpf et al., 2013) and was submitted to ultrasonic sonication to break down the soil aggregates. We fixed the amplitude to 60% in the ultrasonic instrument and sonicated for 5 min to obtain a minimum of 50 W (Poeplau and Don, 2014). After sonication the procedure described above was repeated: tube was centrifuged and the supernatant (which holds the OF fraction) was discarded.  The residual material in the falcon tube is the mineral associated organic matter (MAOM-fraction). To remove the SPT from the soil 40 mL of DIW was added and the tube centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 0.5 h. This step was repeated at least 4 times until the electrical conductivity of the supernatant was below 100 µS cm-1. As before, the material was transferred into a pre-weighted aluminium boat. The weight of the boat after drying at 105°C  was recorded to obtain the weight of  MAOM-fraction. Two internal standards were used in each batch as well as 10% of replicated samples to account for accuracy and precision. The full method is described in Reinsch et al. 2024. Total carbon and total nitrogen were analysed on the LF-fraction, and MAOM-fractions, and on a subsample of the archived (dried and sieved) soil using an Elementar Vario-ELelemental analyser (Elementaranalysensysteme GmbH, Hanau, Germany) following the UKAS accredited method SOP3102, at UKCEH Lancaster. These measurements result in LF-N, MAOM-N, and total soil nitrogen. Total soil carbon measured on the archived soil is used to calculate total soil organic carbon (SOC) as follows: SOC (g per 100 g) = total soil carbon (g per 100 g, %) – Calcite-C (g per 100 g, %) SOC (g per g) = SOC (g SOC per 100 g) / 100 Further, the carbon fractions of the LF (LF-C) and MAOM (MAOM-C) fractions were calculated as: LF-C (g per g) = (LF_mass_g / Ovendry_soil_g) * (TC_LF_perc/100) MAOM-C (g per g) = (MAOM_mass_g / Ovendry_soil_g) * (TC_MAOM_perc - Calcite_C_perc)/100 Where LF_mass_g is the weight of the LF fraction, Ovendry_soil_g is the mass of the archived soil subsample after drying at 105oC, TC_LF_perc is the carbon concentration (%) of the LF fraction as derived from elemental analysis. A similar approach was taken for the MAOM-C fraction with the difference that TC_MAOM_perc was corrected for its inorganic carbon content (Calcite_C_perc), and was then converted from % to g per g. The weight (mass), and carbon and nitrogen concentrations of the OF fraction and POM-fraction were calculated as: OF (mass, g per g) = SOC (mass, g SOC per g soil) – LF (mass, g per g) – MAOM (mass, g per g) POM (mass, g per g) = LF (g per g) + OF (g per g) Where masses of SOC, LF and MAOM are corrected for the content of hygroscopic water. The occluded carbon and nitrogen fractions were calculated as follows: OF-C (g per g) = SOC (g per g) – LF-C (g per g) – MAOM-C (g per g) OF-N (g per g) = total soil nitrogen (g per g) – LF-N (g per g) – MAOM-N (g per g) In cases where OF-C or OF-nitrogen resulted in values below zero, these were attributed to measurement uncertainty and set to 0 before the following calculations of POM-C and POM-N: POM-C (g per g) = LF-C + OF-C POM-N (g per g) = LF-N + OF-N  Total soil carbon and MAOM-C are corrected for calcite-C content; LF, OF and POM fractions are not corrected for calcite content because no minerals are expected to be present in organic matter. LF, MAOM, total soil, and SOC (total soil carbon minus calcite-carbon) were corrected for hygroscopic water content. The OF and POM fractions are automatically corrected for hygroscopic water as they are calculated from corrected masses.  Details of data structure The dataset consists of 13 columns and 101 rows. “NA” refers to samples not analysed for that metric.

INTRODUCTION    The NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme is centred upon the intensive study  of a large field experiment located at the Macaulay Land Use Research Institute’s  farm at Sourhope in the Scottish Borders. A full description of the site, the rationale  for the main field experiment and experimental design, methods and management can  be found in the Baseline Data Survey dated November 1998.    At the outset of the experiment, a broad scale of monitoring was prescribed in order to  provide research groups with a general context in which to view their more detailed  studies. The presentation of a large number of figures and tables closely follows the  procedure adopted in Report II, with the twin aims of enabling groups to more easily  recognise links with their own data as well as facilitating comparisons between years.  The types and dates of measurements are listed in Table 1.     Management of the site was impacted by two unrelated events in 2001:    a) Use of the Sourhope field site was affected by the imposition of Government  restrictions following the outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) in the UK  during February 2001 (Table 2). No visitors were allowed to visit the site between  February and the end of May. During this period work was undertaken by the  Officer(s) in Charge on behalf of research groups in accordance with an agreed  timetable. Thereafter researchers were able to resume their own sampling subject to  their visits complying with a protocol laid out by the Macaulay Land Use Research  Institute vet in Aberdeen and strictly monitored by the Officer in Charge at Sourhope.    Key management activities on the Site were relatively unaffected by FMD. As a result  liming, nitrogen application, pH measurements, biomass collections, vegetation  cutting and Point Analysis were undertaken in accordance with the agreed 2001 Site  Management Plan. Although the first biocide application in May was missed, the  following four applications were successfully completed. 4 b) The officer in charge at the site changed, following the departure of Sarah  Buckland in May 2001.    2. RESULTS    2.1 Automatic Weather Station. 2001 headline weather data collected from the site  were generally unremarkable (Table 3). Following the previous particularly wet year,  rainfall was close to the long term annual average. Total annual radiation showed little  change, whilst average temperatures were slightly reduced and average soil moisture  content was somewhat raised compared to previous years    2.2 Above-ground biomass. Amongst the treatments there was a consistent hierarchy  of biomass estimates throughout the sampling period and all treatments yielded peak  biomass production in July or August (Fig 1). It is, however, noteworthy that there  was a substantial increase in biomass estimates in 2001 compared to the previous  years (Fig 2a). It is suggested that this is likely to result from a combination of a  change in personnel and the switch from manual cutting to the use of mechanical  shears in 2001. All treatment measures were therefore normalised against C1 in each  year (Fig 2b) to identify a continuation of the positive impact upon productivity of  nitrogen and, to a lesser extent, lime. As in the previous year, the most effective  promotion of above-ground biomass was apparent in the nitrogen plus lime treatment.    In separate analyses biomass dry weights were ln-transformed before performing   ANOVA’s which reveal significant differences (Table 4) between improved (N and/or  L added) and non-improved plots, a significant interaction between treatment and year  (Table 5) but no significant differences between blocks (F=0.76, df=4,115, p>0.05).    2.3 Soil pH. Soil samples collected from the upper 5cm of the soil profile show that  the addition of lime has continued to raise soil pH to an average, in October 2001, of  6.19 in the limed plots and 6.38 in the N&L plots, whilst the addition of nitrogen  alone has also raised soil pH albeit it to a lesser extent (Fig 3). Mean soil pH in the  control plots has not changed significantly since the baseline measures were collected  in August 1998. 5 2.4 Botanical composition. The protocol for the Point Analysis survey in July 2001  mirrored that used in July 2000 and, on each occasion, Sarah Buckland was one of the  two surveyors who were each responsible for approximately 50% of the total number  of quadrats surveyed. There was no statistically significant difference between the  results recorded by each surveyor in 2001 (Genstat 5, General blocked ANOVA  F=1.90; df = 2, 1, 26; p = 0.18NS). It is perhaps of some significance, therefore, that  the total number of hits in the 2001 survey was 58% higher than the total number of  hits in the 2000 survey and this is apparent across all treatments. This suggests that  the sward is becoming more dense perhaps resulting from the removal of grazing  stock in 1998.    There were clear treatment differences in the most frequently encountered species in  2001 (Fig 4). Although the identities of these species did not vary significantly when  compared to the same treatments in the previous year, absolute values of relative  abundance, measured as the number of “hits” per species as a percentage of the total  number of “hits” within each treatment, revealed a number of large changes between  2001 and 2000 (Table 6). In particular Agrostis capillaris, which was the most  frequently encountered species in every treatemnt in 2000, showed a decline across all  treatments in 2001 with the result that it only remained the most abundant species in  the Control 1 and Limed plots. In contract both Festuca species (ovina and rubra)  increased across all treatments and were most frequently encountered within the  Nitrogen and Biocide (Festuca ovina) and Nitrogen & Lime (Festuca rubra) plots.  Species associated with improved grassland (Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis) were  most apparent in the fertilised plots (particularly those treated with both Nitrogen and  Lime) whilst species associated with less fertile pastures, such as Anthoxanthum  odoratum and Nardus stricta were more apparent within the untreated Control plots  (Fig 4).    A total of 24 separate species were identified in each of the unimproved treatments  (Control and Biocide) whilst only 18 separate species were found within the Nitrogen  & Lime plots suggesting that plant diversity may be starting to decline within the  most improved plots (Table 6). 6 The Point Analysis data have been subjected to Principal Components Analysis (PCA,  Genstat 5) (Fig 5) in order to examine the degree of association between samples.  There is no statistical weighting applied to the less common species as the intention is  to focus on any broad shifts among the dominant species. The analysis largely  separates those plots treated with nitrogen and/or lime from the control and biocide  plots. The vegetation within these latter unimproved plots tends to be rather more  uniform and is associated, in particular, with the presence of Agrostis vinealis,  Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus (and other bryophytes), Nardus stricta and Anthoxanthum  odoratum. The improved plots (ie those treated with Nitrogen and/or Lime) often  account for the most extreme points (Fig 5a) and an increase in the frequency of  contact with Festuca rubra within the limed plots is particularly apparent. Species  closely aligned with F. rubra include Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis and Holcus mollis.    Further evidence for the direction of change initiated by the main plot treatments can  be seen when the number of hits per plot for the major vegetation species are  correlated against estimates of the above-ground biomass obtained for each plot  during the summer 2001 cuts (Fig 6). The relative abundance of Festuca rubra and  Poa pratensis are positively correlated with biomass, whilst Anthoxanthum odoratum,  Nardus stricta, Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus (plus other bryophytes) and Agrostis  vinealis decline in relative abundance as biomass increases. There is a significant  increase in the frequency with which litter is encountered in those plots treated with  nitrogen and/or lime, reflecting a faster rate of vegetation turnover as soil fertility  increases.    3. SITE HETEROGENEITY    3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition. It was noted in the  year 2000 report that columns E and F, on the right-hand side of the site facing up the  slope, contained more acidic plots than columns on the left-hand side of the slope.  Although this effect is probably exaggerated  by the fact that 60% of the plots in these  columns are either Controls or treated with Biocide, there is support for an underlying  spatial heterogeneity across the experimental site in the comparatively low pH  measures recorded within the Nitrogen and/or Lime improved plots in theses columns  (Fig 7). 7   3.2 Variation in vegetation Biomass. Total biomass values for each plot are shown in  Fig 8. In 2001 outlying plots contain the lowest biomass within all treatments (Control  1 plot 5A; Control 2 plot 1D; Nitrogen plot 2A; Lime plot 5B; Nitrogen and Lime plot  1A; Biocide plot 1E). This is mirrored for the cumulative biomass (1999 to 2001) for  all treatments except Nitrogen. Conversely the highest biomass levels are generally  found within plots which are more centrally located on the site (eg Nitrogen and Lime  plot 2E; Lime plot 2C; Biocide plot 2D and Control 1 plot 2B).    There is a strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass (Fig 9) but  no significant difference in biomass sampled between blocks (Genstat 5, ANOVA  F=0.69,df=5,4,20,p= 0.61NS – see Appendix 1 for values).    ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  I would like to thank Sarah Buckland for her help following my appointment as  Officer in Charge at Sourhope and her assistance during the summer 2001 Point  Analysis Survey. I am also grateful for the support of MLURI farm staff at Sourhope,  Richard Scott, Mandy Lane, Peter Millard and fellow members of the Soil  Biodiversity Programme. 8 Table 1 Data collection on the main Soil Biodiversity field experiment at  Sourhope    • Soil pH      9th March 2001 & 16th October 2001    40ml of de-ionized water was mixed into c.25g soil (0-5cm deep) and allowed  to stand for 20 minutes before measurement. One sample was taken from the  centre of each plot.    • Above-ground productivity  5th – 18th May (*)  4th – 8th Jun   3rd – 18th Jul (*)  6th – 14th Aug   4th – 11th Sep  (*) includes periods where mower unavailable due to mechanical breakdown    A Kubota riding grass mower was used at 3 weekly intervals during the  summer to cut vegetation on the site to c.6cm. Prior to each mow, random  0.5m2 quadrats in each of sub-plots S, T, U & V were located on each plot and  cut to c.6cm, using hand-held mechanical grass shears. The clippings were  collected, oven-dried at 800C and subsequently weighed.    • Botanical surveys    16th July to 3rd August  The same 0.5m2 cell within each of S, T, U & V sub-plots of each plot was  allocated for use in a full botanical survey. A Point Quadrat frame, containing  a grid of 100 5cm x 5cm cells, was placed over the cell. Large “pins” were  then dropped into 25 of these smaller cells and a record made of each occasion  a species was touched by the pin down the vegetation profile.    14th to 17th August  Small-scale relative cover vegetation survey around minirhizotron tubes in  Control 1, Biocide, and Nitrogen & Lime plots (on behalf of Project 2113 –  Macaulay Institute).    22nd to 24th August  Relative cover vegetation survey within disturbance/nutrient addition matrix in  sub-plot Y of Control 1 plots (on behalf of Project 2133 – Lancaster  University).      • Weather data    An Automatic Weather Station is located on the site. This was regularly  downloaded and transmitted to the Soil Biodiversity Data Manager at CEH,  Merlewood. 9 Table 2 Schedule of site activity 1998 to 2001          1998  1999  2000  2001  Soil sampling  2  63  68  31  Measurement  1  13  33  12  Experimental set  up/input    0    9    15    4    Other    0    5    12    9    Total    3    90    128    56 10 Table 3 Soil Biodiversity Site Automatic Weather Station – headline measures  1999 to 2001        Total  rainfall  (mm)  Total  radiation  (MJ m-2 )  Avge soil  moisture  content     (m3 m-3)  Avge air  temp 2m  (0C)  Avge air  temp 2cm  (0C)  Avge   soil temp  0C -2cm Avge       soil temp   0C -5cm  Avge   soil temp  0C -10cm Avge      soil temp  0C -20cm 1999 845  3439  0.30  8.17  8.33  8.65  8.64  8.65  8.57  2000 1209  3472  0.35  7.47  8.00  8.12  8.08  8.07  8.04  2001 839  3473  0.37  7.28  7.66  7.72  7.67  7.66  7.62 11 Table 4 Results of split plot ANOVA (Genstat 5) examining the effect of  Treatment on shoot biomass harvested over the summer in (a) 1999, (b) 2000 and  (c) 2001. Estimates of shoot biomass were made at each of the five mowing  occasions conducted during each summer, when vegetation was collected from  random 0.5m2 cells in each of S, T, U & V sub-plots in each plot. Dried weights  were summed, to give a total annual biomass, and then ln-transformed for the  purpose of these analyses.

1    Considerations in the use of Countryside Survey soil data    Sampling design  Soils were sampled in Countryside Survey (CS) in 1978, 1998, 2007 and 2019. In both 1978 and 1998  the same 256 squares were sampled, whilst in 2007 soils were collected from all 591 CS squares – but  not all measurements were made on all samples. Power analyses were carried out to determine the  number of samples required to detect significant change (see Emmett et al. 2008). A pilot survey was  carried out in 2018, and 2019 was the start of a rolling survey with the aim to measure ~100 squares  each year for five years before repeating.   Sample location  Soils are sampled from the CS X-plots, and there are 5 of these plots randomly spaced in a CS square.  The X-plots within a square are NOT replicates, as they may be in very different land uses, on different  soil types etc. Over the years, X-plots are sometimes relocated due to the destruction of a plot (e.g.  it’s turned into a car park) or permission to access the land is denied, or the lack of certainty in  relocating the original plot location. However, each location has a unique repeat identifier, e.g. 2RPT1,  which refers to square 2, repeat plot 1, where repeat plot 1 is a known location in the square. Samples  with the same unique identifier should be considered to come from the same location, although the  exact locations from which soils were sampled will be ca. 2 - 3 m apart as we move around the 4  corners of a permanently marked 2 m x 2 m plot at each sampling location. See Emmett et al. (2008)  for further information.  Sampling  Soils are only collected from the top 15 cm (8 cm for the invertebrate sample) of the soil profile, in  1998, 2007 and the 2019 rolling survey this was done using a soil core hammered in to the soil and  then pulled out. In 1978, a soil pit was dug and soil collected from the top 15 cm of the profile in the  side of the pit. In some soils, it is not possible to collect a full 15-cm long core due to stones, or shallow  soils. Core photographs and detailed measurements of core dimensions were made by lab staff in  2007 on the 2 of the 4 cores sampled (black cores and N mineralization cores). This method was  adopted for the rolling CS survey.  Measurements  The only laboratory measurements made in 1978 were pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI). In CS1990, some  soil mapping was carried out. Multiple cores were taken from each X-plot in 1998, 2007 and the CS  rolling survey 2018/2019-2023, and different cores have different measurements made on them. No  chemical analyses are made by soil horizons – samples are homogenised before pH and LOI  measurements. Bulk density was measured in 2007, and 2018/19-2023 but not by using the ISO bulk  density method (which would have required a whole core simply for this measurement). A report on  the implication of this and a full description of methods is available (Emmett et al. 2008).  Statistical analysis  Statistical analyses of CS soils data should take note of the statistical issues outlined above. Soils results  do not always take account of the land class structure. If the land classes are not taken into account,  then results are the stock and change of the population, whilst if the land classes are taken into  account, the results are weighted by the land classes and results become national estimates of stock  and change. Likewise, bootstrapping is not always used in analyses of soils data. However, the  structure of CS should be taken into account and at the least a mixed model should be used, with  square as a random factor, to take into account the fact that multiple X-plots (up to 5) are contained  within each CS square. Finally, in contrast to some monitoring programmes only one core is taken per  location but it should be noted that design based approaches such as CS, where spatial structure is 2    not generally of interest, a dispersed set of observations is the most efficient approach and overall  precision and coverage is increased by widespread placing of samples if regional estimates are  required. We advise all users of CS soils data to consult with UKCEH prior to analysis and interpretation  and to check on publications already released which exploit the data which are listed on the CS  website.

There were 360 squares surveyed for freshwater in CS1990 and 425 surveyed in  CS2000.  In 1996 the Lowland Pond Survey was undertaken at 150 CS squares in environmental  zones 1, 2 and 4.  Following the success of LPS96, the assessment of pond biological condition will  now be fully integrated into CS2007 at all CS squares, not just lowland areas.  For CS2007, the biological condition of headwater streams and ponds will be surveyed.  Countryside  Survey is the only national freshwater survey that has the potential to deal with a range of water body  types across the entire GB landscape.    For headwater streams, the following elements will be re-surveyed in each of the 425 squares visited  for CS2000:  •  Macroinvertebrate community  •  Aquatic plant community  •  Hydromorphological characteristics of the watercourse (River Habitat Survey)  •  Physical characteristics of the watercourse  •  Water chemistry    The following elements will be surveyed in a randomly selected pond in each of the 629 CS2007  squares found to contain ponds:  •  Aquatic plant community  •  Physical characteristics of the waterbody  Water chemistry 2    EQUIPMENT      Equipment will be provided as follows:     General Items  Central  supply  Number  per team  Surveyor  Safety & identification        Bivvy bags  b  2    Dayglo waistcoats  b  3    First aid kit  b  2    Handouts (explaining project)  b      Identity card  b  3    Mobile phones  b  3    Phone cards  b      Torches (in vehicles)  b  1    Whistle  b  3    Personal waterproof clothing   (b)  3  b  Navigation & location        Aerial photographs of the site  b  1    Compass  b  2    Hand held GPS  b  1    Maps of the site (1:10,000)  b  2    Road atlas  b  1    Maps to locate sites (1:50,000)    1    Recording & measuring        Survey poles (x plot)  b  1    Field assessment booklets (FAB's)  b  1    Weatherproof clipboards  b  3    Measuring tape (30 metre)  b  2    Digital camera  b  1    Rangefinder    1    Plot marker boards  b  1    Reloscope    1    DBH tape    1    Poly bags  b      Folding 2m ruler    1    Metal detectors  b  1    Spring balance    1    Rucksack (if available)   b  3  b  Pencils and rubber   b      Reference books (if needed)    b  b  Hand lens    b  b  Binoculars (if available)      b 3    Freshwater equipment  Number  needed per  team  Health and Safety     Life jacket  2  Spare CO2 cylinders  3  Bactericidal soap  2  Tap water container  1  Protek anti-septic cream  2  Antiseptic wipes  2  Hand gloves  2  Shoulder length gloves  2  Penknife  1        General     Thigh waders  2  Chest waders  2  Permanent broad marker pens  2  Scissors  1  Waterproof labels  1  Waterproof notepad  1  A4 aquascribe laser paper (box of 250 sheets)  1  Box file  1  Pencils (soft e.g. 3b)  4  Pencil sharpener  2  Rubber  2  Stapler  1        Stream Macroinvertebrate Sampling     Standard FBA pond-nets with graduated handles  2  18" x 12" plastic bags (pack of 100)  1  1.3 litre polythene pots with tight fitting lids  56  Toxis warning tape for small formalin transort bottles  and sample pots  1  PVC tape for sealing pot lids  2  40% formaldehyde  1  Small plastic bottles for transporting formalin  4  Stop watch  1        River Habitat Survey     Range poles  1 4        Stream Aquatic Plant Survey     9" x 7" re-sealable plastic bags for plants (pack of 100)  1  Small brown envelopes  1        Stream & Pond Chemical Survey     1l bottle for water sample  2  Hanna Combi hand-held pH & conductivity meter   1  pH calibration standards  1  Conductivity calibration standards  1  Distilled water washbottle  1  75 ml syringe  5  Disposable, non-sterile 0.45 µm filter cartridges (33  mm diameter)  1  50ml acid-washed water sample bottles  72  Pre-paid, pre-addressed padded envelopes  40        Pond Aquatic Plant and Environmental Survey     Grapnel  1  Pile of A4 white paper  1  Old newspaper (for drying and pressing plant  specimens)  1  Shallow plastic tray e.g 35cm x 25 cm x 5 cm to float  plants for pressing  1  Thin white card for lifting floating plants for pressing  2  Weight for pressing – e.g plant crib  1  A4 plastic punched wallets for keeping dry pressed  specimens  20  Box file for keeping dry pressed specimens  1  25ml sterilin tubes  30  80% alcohol (25l drum)  0.1 5    HEADWATERS      All 425 squares that were surveyed as part of the freshwater module of CS2000 will be re-surveyed as  part of the headwater stream survey in CS2007.  At each of these 425 squares:  1. The stream macroinvertebrate community will be sampled (RIVPACS method).   2. Associated RIVPACS environmental variables will be recorded.  Stream width & depth, velocity or discharge category, substrate composition,  altitude, distance from source and slope.  3. The hydromorphological status of the site will be recorded (2003 River Habitat Survey  method).  4. The aquatic plant community will be surveyed (MTR method).  5. An indicative water chemistry sample will be taken and analysed for:  pH, conductivity, alkalinity, SRP, TON.  For 25 of the 425 squares we will be sampling a new site on a smaller watercourse to replace the  CS2000 site which has been found to be on >3rd order stream.  This will ensure that for CS2007 and  future surveys the sampling effort is more effectively focussed on headwater streams.  The location of the headwater sampling site within a square was generally chosen to maximise the  length of RHS that could be conducted within the square, while also being as close as possible to the  exit-point from the square.  This approach also tended to maximise the proportion of the site’s  catchment which lay within the bounds of the square.  The length of the headwaters sampling site is 500 m of watercourse.  This 500 m defines the limits of  the RHS survey area.  The 100 m aquatic plant survey stretch is located within this stretch, centred on  the macroinvertebrate and water chemistry sampling point, which in turn are, where possible, located  at RHS spot-check 6 (Figure 1).  However it is not always possible to ensure that the sampling  locations adhere to the ideal arrangement.  A number of reasons for this are envisaged and rules for  dealing with each circumstance have been devised (Fig 2).  If there is any uncertainty about what  to do, then please contact CEH staff.

Assume  that the culverted section flows in a  straightline between disappearing and  re-appearing and record that the stecth is  part-culverted. 7  Distribution of duties  The two assigned freshwater surveyors in a team will be designated as person A and person B for the  purposes of this section.  The following allocation of duties is a recommendation but may be  varied according to local circumstances.  Having established permission to sample, the surveyors should first find the macroinvertebrate  sampling point, using the maps and grid references provided.  All other survey procedures relate to  this position.  Health and safety  Almost all CS2007 headwater survey sites have been previously sampled and therefore are not likely  to be unsafe to sample.  However upon locating the the macoinvertebrate sample point along the  watercourse both surveyors should discuss whether the watercourse is safe to sample.  Issues to  consider include:  •  Vehicle parking, access from road  •  Current weather/flow conditions/water colour (Does the watercourse appear to be in spate?)  •  River bed substrate, ease of access/bank stability and general condition.  •  Obstacles to the watercourse e.g. fencing  •  Livestock in adjacent fields  These factors need to be considered and if any are deemed to be HIGH RISK or more than two are  deemed MODERATE RISK, then do not proceed with the sampling.  It is also advisable to note the  nearest location where there is an adequate mobile phone signal.  Sequence of completion of tasks  If A is the senior freshwater surveyor in each team and B the assistant freshwater surveyor (with  aquatic plant identification skills) then, the allocation of tasks might be as follows:  •  Surveyor A to collect the water sample and record pH and conductivity.  •  Surveyor B to meanwhile begin recording RIVPACS site environmental data.  •  Surveyor A to collect macroinvertebrate sample with assistance on timing, fixing and bagging  of sample from Surveyor B.  •  Surveyor A and B to complete the recording of RIVPACS site environmental data together.  •  Surveyor B to undertake the aquatic plant survey, calling out the information to Surveyor A,  who will enter the data into IRIS while following along on the bankside.  The aquatic plant  survey should extend for 50 m upstream and 50 m downstream of the centre of the  macroinvertebrate sampling area.  •  Surveyor A to undertake the RHS, calling out the information to Surveyor B, who will enter  the data into RAPID while following along on the bankside.  The RHS should, if possible, be  located along the identical stretch of watercourse as was covered in CS2000 (but see RHS  section of handbook for more detail).  The limits of the CS2000 RHS site are indicated on the  map and on the tablet PC. 8  Photographs  Photographs are required of both the macroinvertebrate sampling area and any other features of  interest along the RHS reach.  The macroinvertebrate photograph will be used to relocate the site for  future Countryside Surveys and should be sufficiently wide angled and composed to show any  prominent natural or man-made features that will identify the location accurately for future surveyors.  The marker board should be in the photograph and should be marked with the letter M (for  macroinvertebrate sample) and the square number and should be of the form:  M  457    The RHS photographs should show the typical character of the river along the 500 m survey section.   The marker board should again be included marked with the letters RHS and the square number and  hence be of the form:  RHS  457    The aquatic plant survey photographs should show the typical character of the river along the 100 m  survey section.  The marker board should again be included marked with the letters MTR and the  square number and hence be of the form:  MTR  457    Record the photographs taken on the RIVPACS sample area form and in RAPID and IRIS. 9  Water chemistry sampling and recording  A single indicative chemical sample will be taken at each watercourse.  The sample will be collected  at the downstream end of the macroinvertebrate sampling area prior to any biological sampling.  The following elements will be measured at each headwater site.  •  Conductivity and pH: field measurement  •  Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), total oxidisable nitrogen (TON), alkalinty:  50 ml filtered  Enter the watercourse and facing upstream rinse both 1 L wide-neck bottles 3 times with river water  taken from a flowing area upstream of your position.  Then move a few more steps upstream and fill  the bottles with undisturbed stream water from the water column without disturbing the stream bed or  any soft bed-sediments.  One of the 1 L bottles will be used for the pH and conductivity  measurements, while the other will be used as a source for the filtered water sample to be analysed for  SRP, TON, and alkalinity.  Conductivity and pH measurement  Please familiarize yourselves with the Hanna Combi pH & conductivity meter prior to use.  Read the  manufacturer’s instructions and understand the operational protocols.  Ensure that the meter is well- rinsed since use at the previous site and is properly calibrated (two-point calibration for the pH meter).   The manufacturer’s instructions for calibrating the meter are provided in the meter box.  Ideally the  meter should be checked against the standards before every square and re-calibrated if necessary.  You toggle between pH/conductivity and total dissolved solids display on the meter by pressing the  SET/HOLD button.  Conductivity: Submerge the probe-end of the meter in the collected 1 L sample bottle, immediately  after the sample has been taken.  Select ‘µS’ mode with the SET/HOLD button.  The measurements  should be taken when the stability symbol (a stopwatch icon) on the top left of the display screen  disappears.  Please note the units.  pH: Submerge the meter in the collected 1 L sample bottle, immediately after the sample has been  taken, stirring gently.  Select ‘pH’ mode with the SET/HOLD button.  The measurement should be  taken when the stability symbol (a stopwatch icon) on the top left of the display screen disappears.  Record the readings on the RIVPACS Sample Area Form.  SRP, TON, and alkalinity  A filtered water sample is needed for the analysis of these parameters.  Filtering will be done on site  using disposable 0.45 µm pore size, 33 mm diameter syringe filters.  A 50 ml plastic sample bottle will need to be labeled externally before becoming wet using a black  marker pen:  Project     ‘CS2007’  Type of waterbody:  ‘Stream” or “Pond’  Square number:   square number (e.g. 38)  Date:      day-month-year (e.g. 07-08-07).  Wash the syringe by twice filling the syringe chamber with some of the water sample and emptying it  on to the ground.  Then fill the syringe chamber again with sample water and attach a new disposable  filter cartridge.  Then empty the water in the chamber, through the filter, into the 50 ml plastic sample  bottle.  Rinse the sample bottles out with this water.  Do not exert excessive pressure as this might  rupture the filter. 10  Remove the filter, fill the syringe chamber once more with some of the water sample, re-attach the  same filter cartridge and fill the 50 ml plastic sample bottle.  If filter cartridge becomes blocked  during filtration then change and continue with more of unfiltered water sample.  After filtering,  check the filtered sample for suspended material e.g. from a ruptured filter paper.  If suspended  material is present then discard the filtered sample and start again.  Screw on the lid tightly and place in the pre-addressed and postage-paid padded envelope along with  the pond water sample (if there is one).  Complete the sample information form (Fig 3) giving details  to aid the laboratory chemists at CEH Lancaster in identifying the sample and ensuring that the  subsequent measurements are assigned to the correct waterbody in the correct CS square.

The primary objective is to collect the widest range of animals possible from within the sample area,  using a sampling method that is comparable to that used in CS1990, CS2000 and that is compatible  with the RIVPACS bioassessment method.  For the purposes of macroinvertebrate sampling the sample area must be a single continuous area of  stream-bed whose major habitat types can be sampled within the recommended sampling period.  It  will normally vary from 5 to 15m according to stream width. It must not be a collection of separate  sampling points within an extended length of river, for instance to include both riffles and pools in an  attempt to increase the variety of animals captured.  Each habitat in the sampling area must be sampled with an effort proportional to its cover.  Within the  limitations imposed by this procedure, as many different taxa in the sampling area as possible should  be collected.  On average, about 60% of families present will be collected in a single three-minute  kick sample, excluding the manual search.  The sample shall be collected using a standard 25 cm2 pond-net with a 900 µm mesh net.  Wash the  net thoroughly before and after taking samples.  Check that it is neither damaged nor contaminated  with animals from previous samples.  Damaged pond nets must not be used.  Wherever possible, collect samples by sampling for three minutes with a pond-net and one minute of  manual searching (Fig 4).  The manual search is mandatory, although it will not always be fruitful.   The sampling area should not encompass such a wide range of features along the river that it includes  both deep and shallow areas.  There is no limit to the amount of material collected: only the sampling time controls the volume of  the sample.  Material collected in the net must be removed periodically, to prevent the mesh becoming blocked and  the sample being washed-out of the net.  As a minimum, this must be done after every minute of  sampling with a pond-net, and more frequently if the net is filling rapidly or becoming blocked.  Wash  fine sediment through the net more frequently than this, to minimise the amount retained in the  sample.  Large stones and pieces of vegetation (that may damage the net) can be discarded, but before  doing so, agitate them vigorously in the collecting net whilst it is half-submerged, to wash any animals  back into it.  Check that no animals are still attached before discarding this material.  Retain only enough water to keep the sample damp.  This reduces the amount of fixative or  preservative that has to be added to it, and reduces damage.  All specimens captured in the net must be retained in the sample for identification in the laboratory.  However you do not retain fish, amphibians, and readily identified rare species in the samples, such as  large specimens of the freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera) and crayfish, but return  them to the water with care and unharmed.  Record their presence in the sample on the RIVPACS  Sample Area Form.  If removed live for identification, then return them only to the site where they  were collected.  Bear in mind that it is particularly important to identify rare taxa correctly e.g. differentiating native  from introduced crayfish, because of their high conservation value and need for protection, so if there  is any doubt then retain the specimen in the sample.  Avoid sampling during and immediately after spates.  Samples collected in these conditions will not  accurately reflect the underlying environmental quality of the site. 12  1st part: MANUAL SEARCH  Seek and collect individual animals from the water surface.  Spend a total of one minute on the manual search, split between parts 1 and 3    2nd part: MAIN SAMPLE  Collect by either A, B or C  A -  shallow/wadeable  3 minute active pond-net sample collected by a combination of kicking and sweeping, depending on the nature  of the substratum, current and habitats, for benthos and free-swimming animals.  All habitats sampled in proportion to their cover.    B - too deep to kick sample whole site, but possible to sample at least some of the main channel with  pond-net  3 minute active pond-net sample collected by a combination of kicking and sweeping for benthos and free- swimming animals.  Attempt to sample all habitats in proportion to their cover, although this may not be possible for habitats in the  main channel    C - impossible to sample material from the main channel using a pond-net  3 minute sweep with pond-net to collect free-swimming animals and those from vegetation, but not the  benthos.    3rd part: MANUAL SEARCH  Search and collect individual animals from submerged rocks, logs or vegetation.  Spend a total of one minute on the manual search, split between parts 1 and 3    Figure 4  Summary of sampling procedures (modified from Murray-Bligh 1999). 13  Three-minute kick sample (modified from Murray-Bligh 1999).  The kick-net can be used in different ways depending on the nature of the survey area.  Different  habitats at the same site may be sampled by a combination of the methods described below.  The total  sampling time must be three minutes.  If a site comprises discrete habitats, apportion the sampling effort according to their cover in the  sampling area.  If a site appears to be homogeneous in character, continuous diagonal transects will  suffice for most of the sample.  Always move upstream and diagonally across the stream a number of times whilst sampling, rather  than straight upstream (Fig 5).  This will ensure that a greater number of habitats are sampled, even if  they are not apparent, and therefore a higher proportion of the taxa present at the site are collected.  The three minutes covers only the time spent actively sampling, and excludes the time spent emptying  the net, or moving around the site.  It is recommended that sampling is done in short bursts of 15-20  seconds.  There will be 9 to 12 bursts in a three minute sample, which is worth remembering when  apportioning the sampling effort to the different habitats.  A stopwatch must be used to ensure that the  cumulative time spent actively sampling is precisely three minutes.  With two people on-site, one  should time the sampling with the stopwatch while the other collects the sample.  The sampler should  call-out to the timekeeper when to start and stop the watch, and the timekeeper can remind the sampler  when each sampling burst should end.  Kick-net samples collected with less effort, in an attempt to prevent denuding sites on very small  watercourses, are not compatible with RIVPACS.  A longitudinal extension of the site will be  required in these streams.  In general, more material will be collected from lowland streams than from stony mountain streams.  Kick sampling from gravel or cobbles  When kick sampling, hold the net vertically with the frame at right-angles to the current, downstream  from your feet, and resting firmly on the river bed; disturb the stream bed vigorously by kicking or  rotating the heel of your boot to dislodge the substratum and the fauna within it to a depth of about 10  cm.  Hold the net close enough for the invertebrates to flow into the net with the current, but far  enough away for most of the sand and gravel to drop before entering the net.  Hold the net further  away where the substratum is finer or the current swifter, to prevent it clogging.  Move large stones by  hand if they cannot be shifted by foot, and sample the finer sediment that collects beneath them.  Sampling from soft sediments  Where the stream bed is soft silt or clay, kick sampling is ineffective because the net will become  blocked rapidly.  Instead, skim the bottom edge of the net gently through the top few centimetres of  the substratum, which is where most of the animals will be found.  Alternatively, stir-up the surface of  the sediment by foot or with the back of the net, and pass the open net through the clouded water.   Rinse the silt away through the net frequently, by agitating the net in the current or at the water  surface.  Sampling from boulders  It is not easy, and sometimes impossible, to take a kick sample amongst boulders.  Most of the  invertebrates will be in the finer deposits that accumulate under the boulders.  To reach them,  boulders may have to be moved by hand, though small ones may be prised away by foot.  Move  boulders away at right-angles to the current, or upstream and away from feet, so that the net can be  held downstream from the area disturbed.  Sample the exposed river bed by kicking in the normal  way. 14  It is impossible to sample effectively where the stream-bed is dominated by large boulders,  particularly near waterfalls or where the gradient is steep.  Replace these sites by ones that can be  sampled effectively.                                  Figure 5  Kick sampling from a shallow, fast-flowing stream.  The sampler is facing at right angles to the  current and is moving diagonally to the right and towards the photographer, for safety.  The  sampler is dislodging the substratum using his left foot and is holding the net close-by, in the  plume of disturbed sediment, to capture the animals that are dislodged.    Sampling from vegetation  Sample from submerged and emergent vegetation and tree roots by pushing the net into them with a  variety of forward, upward, and lateral movements.  Dislodge animals from dense tangles of tree roots  by kicking.  Sample the sediment that accumulates beneath plants by kicking or skimming the surface  of the sediment.  Do not overlook water under overhanging banks, because invertebrates may be  hiding there.  Sampling from still or slow-flowing water over gravel or cobbles  When sampling from still or slow-flowing water, a different procedure is necessary because there is  no current is to carry dislodged animals into the net.  Disturb the substratum with your feet and catch  the dislodged animals by sweeping the net through the water immediately above the disturbed area.   Use this technique wherever the current is weak, to supplement the methods described above.  Sampling from deep waters  In watercourses too deep for conventional kick-sampling, it is possible and to take a sweep sample  from the marginal vegetation and wadeable shoreline with the pond-net.  All habitats must be  sampled, where safe to do so.  If possible, use a combination of sweeping and kicking.  Wherever  pracitable , collect the sample from both banks.  In these circumstances you should sample each  habitat in proportion to its linear dominace along the river channel. 15  The sampling duration shall be three minutes of active sampling supplemented by a manual search.    Manual searching  The manual search is similar, whatever methods are used to collect the main sample.  Unlike the main  sample in which animals are collected without seeing them, individual animals seen by the sampler  are collected in the search and added to the main sample.  The search is in two parts which together last one minute.  The first part is to seek and collect animals  living on the water surface, such as whirligig beetles, water crickets and pond skaters.  This must be  done before any other sampling, because these animals are easily disturbed and will either leave the  sampling area or be much more difficult to find later.  They are best caught with a pond-net.  Most  surface dwellers are very active and they should be secured in a tied bag or vial immediately after  capture.  Whilst searching for these animals, note the area occupied by different habitats within the  sampling area, so that you can apportion the sampling effort amongst them in the main sample.  The second part of the search is for animals from habitats that are not sampled effectively by the  methods use to collect the main sample. Pick-off animals attached or clinging to the submerged stems  of emergent plants, rocks, logs, or other solid objects, with forceps or a stiff paint brush.  Examine  rocks at several places across the river to cover the different biotopes and areas covered by different  sized substrata.  Always search for animals attached to floating-leaved plants.  Inspect the under- surfaces of floating leaves as well as the upper surface and stems.  The whole search must last one minute.  It is standardised by time alone, and not by searching a  certain number of rocks or locations.  This period only covers the time spent actually searching, and  excludes the time spent moving around the site.  A stopwatch or watch with second hand must be used  to ensure that the cumulative time spent actively searching is one minute.  At some sites, the search  will be fruitless, either because no suitable or accessible places to search are found within the minute,  or because no animals are found in the places that are searched.  Even where the sampler suspects that  nothing will be found, the search must be undertaken honestly, to maintain consistency.  Sample fixing and storage  On completion of sampling, the sample should be emptied into a medium gauge, 18" x 12" polythene  bag as provided.  Intermediate emptying of the net after each minute’s active sampling is strongly  recommended and is essential if the net becomes so full as to preclude efficient sampling.  Rinse the sample, where possible by shaking the pond-net vigorously in the stream without risking  loosing any animals, to remove silt and clay. Discard stones, wood, and large fragments of vegetation  before removing the sample from the net but take care to remove any clinging animals and drop them  back in the pond-net.  The easiest way to remove a sample from the pond-net is to wash the catch into one corner of the net  first, by dipping the net into the water and gently shaking it from the opposite corner as it is lifted out  of the water.  Then, by gradually everting the corner of the net, the bulk of the sample can be dropped  into a labeled sample container, or polythene bag.  Material clinging to the net can be shaken, or  flicked-off from the other side of the net, into the container.  Repeat this process until the net is clear  of material.  Recalcitrant specimens may be picked-off the net by hand.  Always wash the collecting net thoroughly to prevent contaminating subsequent samples.  It is very easy to cross-contaminate samples from residual specimens retained on nets from previous  site visits.  Always wash pond nets as thoroughly as possible after sampling at each site and also  before sampling the next site. 16  Fill the sample containers to no more than about two thirds full with collected material.  This will  leave sufficient room for fixative or preservative, and an air space.  Never cram material into a sample  container, and never fill it completely: use an additional container instead.  Then, 40% formalin solution should be added to the sample bag until the liquor in the bag is  equivalent to 4% aqueous formaldehyde.  The precise amount of formalin needed varies from sample  to sample but is in the region of 50 - 100ml per plastic bag.  It is better to err on the side of excess.  A clear pencil-written label should be placed in the sample bag.  The label should contain the  following information:  Type of sample :  “macroinvert”  Square number :  Square number (e.g. 38)  Date    :  day-month-year (e.g. 07-08-07).  The plastic bag should be firmly tied and placed inside a 1.3 l storage pot and the lid of the pot tightly  closed.  An extra sharp twist of the lid is then recommended.  Apply PVC tape around the lid to form  a seal and to prevent the lid becoming loose during transport.  The pot should be clearly labeled on the outside, using a permanent marker, with the same  information as given on the internal label.  The sample may be split into two or more bags/pots if too large to fit within a single container.  All  parts of the sample should be labeled as above, together with the additional information “Part one of  two” or “Part two of two” or “Part one of three” etc.  Samples should very rarely require more than  one container.  Single containers should be adequate for the large majority of sites.  THOROUGH LABELLING OF SAMPLES IS ESSENTIAL  Surveyors should take at least six polythene bags, two sample pots and two bottles of 40%  formaldehyde to the survey square in case the macroinvertebrate sample is very large.  For transport, samples should be stored upright in the grey stacking trays provided. 17  Site environmental data (modified from Murray-Bligh 1999).  Site environmental data should be recorded for each macroinvertebrate sample.  For the purposes of  environmental data collection, the sample area is defined as the full width of the watercourse for the  full length sampled for macroinvertebrates.  The significance of the different definitions of sample area given for macroinvertebrate sampling and  environmental data collection is that sections of the watercourse too deep for macroinvertebrate  sampling are, nevertheless, included in width, depth and substratum evaluations.  When collecting environmental data, the objective should be to measure the modal conditions in the  Sampling Area at the time of sampling.  Avoid isolated features such as boulders or narrows, which  would cause the measurements to be atypical of the Sampling Area as a whole.  Choosing the best  place to measure these is easier when the Survey Area is restricted to a relatively discrete range of  physical conditions.  The environmental data shall be entered on the RIVPACS Sample Area form (Fig 6).  The following  instructions apply:  Square number:  e.g. 38  River Name:  Use river name from CS2000 data, make note if you think the name is incorrect.   For new sites, take name from map if indicated  Site Name:  Use site name from CS2000 data, make note if you think the name is incorrect.   For new sites, take appropriate site name from map.  Sample date:  Use the format: day-month-year (e.g. 07-08-06).  NGR:  Use GPS to record position of macroinvertebrate sampling site to at least 8- digit numeric national grid reference e.g. SY12345678  Recorders:  Enter the initials of both surveyors  Sample method:  Enter either:  Kick/sweep - disturbing the substratum with feet plus sweeping amongst plants  Kick - substratum disturbance but no sweeping  Sweep - sweeping amongst plants but no substratum disturbance  Sample time:  Enter time of active pond-netting (i.e. exclude search time).  In almost all or all  cases the time will be three minutes.  Proportionality:  Answer ‘No’ if the full width of the river for the full length of the sample area  is not sampled.  Only a simple explanation is required (e.g. “Not left-hand- bank.  Too deep”.  NOTE: left/right banks are determined looking  downstream).  Photograph:  A photograph is required of each sampling site.  The photograph should include  a numbered site board.  If possible it should also include a fixed natural or man- made feature of the site which can be helpful in re-location. 18  RIVPACS SAMPLE AREA FORM    CS2007 SQUARE No.:      RIVER:      SITE:    DATE:       NGR:          RECORDERS:    SAMPLE METHOD:  KICK   KICK/SWEEP   SWEEP  SAMPLE TIME (should be 3 mins active sampling plus 1 min manual search):    Is sampling proportional to occurrence of habitats?

The graduated pond-net handle can be used for width,  depth and surface velocity measurements.  Water width:  The stream width should reflect the predominant conditions in the sampling  area. Measure the stream width at right-angles to the channel.  Measure the  width of the water surface, not the stream channel, and include water under  overhanging banks.  If temporary islands form in the channel because of low flow, include them in  the measurement.  Choose a place to measure the width that gives an  approximately modal value for the site.  Alternatively, where the modal width is  difficult to estimate and it is safe and easy to cross the river, an average of more  than one measurement from the vicinity of the sampling area can be used,  although this should not normally be necessary.  Use the accurately marked kick-net handle to measure width.  On deep  watercourses, either estimate the stream width, making use of nearby bridges  (although sites should not be in the immediate vicinity of bridges), or use a  rangefinder.  Wherever possible, width should be measured rather than estimated.  As a  minimum, estimate widths of less than one metre to the nearest 10 cm; widths of  between one and two metres to the nearest 20 cm; and widths between two and  ten metres to the nearest 50 cm; and widths greater than ten metres to the  nearest metre.  Water depth:  The depth should reflect the predominant conditions in the sampling area.   Depth should be based on the average of measurements from approximately a  quarter, half, and three-quarter distance along a transect across the stream in the  sampling area.  Do not measure depth where it is atypical of the site, for instance over or close  to boulders.  When a temporary island appears in mid-channel, the depth there  will be zero, and should be recorded as such.  Where the stream is wadeable, record the depth to the nearest centimetre.   Where the depth has to be estimated, record depths to 1 m to the nearest 10 cm,  and greater depths to the nearest 50 cm.  Surface velocity:  Current velocity must be measured only in Scotland and its offshore islands.  The measurements refer to the typical surface velocity in the main flow channel.   Dead water areas and atypically fast flowing areas should be avoided.  The  measurements should refer to the surface velocity in the main flow channel.  The time that it takes for a floating object (e.g. a leaf of a twig) to travel a  known distance can be used to measure the velocity.  If the object is thrown into  the current, measurements should not be started until initial inertia of the object  is overcome.  Results should be measured in cm s-1.  For preference, the object should be measured over a 10 metre run with a  relatively constant current speed. This may not be possible in small streams or  where the character of the river changes rapidly.  In this case, the same guiding  principles recommending for selecting the position of depth measurements  should also apply to current velocity, and the object can be timed against the  pond-net handle.  It is important that current velocity is measured accurately as possible.  Poor  runs of the floating object should be discarded and the estimated category 20  should ideally be based on the modal or median value of at least three timed  runs on each visit.  Current velocities are recorded using the categories shown in  Table 1.  Table 1  Velocity categories for RIVPACS                Substratum:  The composition of the stream bed must be assessed over the whole sampling  area, i.e. the full width of river along the whole length sampled, even if some  parts of it are inaccessible for sampling.  Visual estimates of four categories of  particle size are required (Table 2, Fig 7).  Estimates must be based on a bird’s-eye view of the superficial stream-bed layer  and should include both particles which are visible and those which would be  visible in the absence of plant-growth.  The percentage cover of the stream-bed  occupied by each of the four size categories should be recorded.  THE FOUR  VALUES SHOULD ALWAYS TOTAL 100%.  Estimates should exclude bedrock which is recorded on a separate part of the  recording form.  A peat stream-bed should be recorded as silt.  Clay can either  be areas of soft fine particles or a continuous sheet.  A fine layer of silt or clay through which the shape of the underlying stones can  be seen should be typed according to the underlying substratum, but if the  shapes of the underlying stones are not distinct, the silt or clay should be  recorded instead.  Compacted clay should be recorded as clay, even when  broken-up into gravel-sized fragments.  Experience has shown that cover estimates are improved if both surveyors  estimate percentage cover at the same site and compare results.  Fig 8 may be  used as a guide to how best to estimate cover.  Copies of the figure could be  attached to the back of clipboards and used as an aid in the field.  Walk along the river bank and make a preliminary note of the substratum after  any surface-living animals have been collected.  These initial evaluations will be  particularly useful at silty sites, and will be necessary for apportioning the  sampling effort.  After the rest of the biological sample has been collected, walk  over the whole sampling area before making the final estimates.  It is difficult to  judge the composition of the river bed in deep or turbid water.  The substratum  visible at the water's edge, the feel of the stream-bed under foot, the contents of  the sampling net, previously recorded data, and local knowledge may all be used  as guides.

The purpose of the sketch map is to enable future relocation of the site.  Keep this fact in  mind when drawing the map.  Draw a sketch of approximately 50 m of river channel indicating the general physical character of the  site and incorporating the macroinvertebrate sampling area.  This should include permanent reference  features (such as a distance from a bridge or footpath sign) which would enable anyone else to find  the site with adequate precision in the future.  Main features to mark on sketch map:  •  General form of river channel, including islands, flow direction and prominent bank features  •  Relocation features - for both ends of the survey length if possible.  These should be near  permanent landmarks such as hedgerows, fence lines, walls, electricity pylons, roads, bridges,  buildings etc.  •  Record distances from/ between features  •  Grid north (found from OS map) and estimated scale e.g. indicate on map what length is 10 m.  •  Adjacent land use - for example woodland, arable, pasture, factory, waste, set aside  •  Extent of macroinvertebrate sampling area  •  Location from where photos were taken.  •  Any potential hazards. 25  River Habitat Survey  General principle  An assessment of the hydromorphological diversity and condition of river reaches was carried out as  part of CS2000 using the 1997 version of the River Habitat Survey form (Raven et al. 1998).  Since  then the RHS protocols has been updated and a 2003 version of the method is now available  (Environment Agency 2003) and will be used for CS2007.  The changes between the two versions  affect the way the RHS indices are calculated but values will still be comparable between the two  versions.  The 2003 RHS protocol is described in detail in the guidance manual provided along with the training  course and therefore will not be covered in detail here.  All CS2007 surveyors will receive RHS  training and accreditation in the2003 version from the Environment Agency RHS team.  We will be using a field digital data entry system, called RAPID, to record the RHS data on site.  This  will reduce the likelihood of errors associated with transferring data from paper copy to a database,  and will allow more effective use of staff time.  There is also the added benefit of being able to  validate the entered data while the surveyor is still on-site, thus improving data quality.  A copy of the  2003 RHS field survey guidance manual will be easily accessible from RAPID on the Tablet PC.  The  design of RAPID and the format of data entry mimics the 2003 RHS form and therefore should be  easily understood by an accredited RHS surveyor.  The RHS section will be 500 m long and will be centred (wherever possible) on the selected  macroinvertebrate sampling site.  The survey will be undertaken irrespective of whether there is flow  or not in that section of the watercourse and, hence, whether or not a macroinvertebrate sample was  collected.  In some circumstances it may not be possible to centre the survey on the macroinvertebrate  sampling site nor to survey a full 500m.  A number of reasons for this are envisaged and rules for  dealing with each circumstance have been devised (Fig 2).  Field surveyors should seek advice from  senior CEH staff if any other circumstances are encountered.  RAPID is an MS Access database designed to capture and store RHS data in the field using a Tablet  PC.  You simply double-click the RAPID icon on the desktop to open the application.  Then you  select from the opening form whether you wish to input survey data for a new site, export data from  an existing site or exit the database (Fig 9).                          Figure 9   Desktop icon and screen shot of the opening menu of the River Habitat Survey field digital  data entry system (RAPID). 26  Inputting survey data  The data entry form consists of 17 sections across 4 pages.  Pages 1, 3 and 4 gather general survey  information and data for the sweep-up part of the RHS.  Page 2 is where the spot-check data is entered.   You can switch between the four pages using page buttons at the top of the window (Fig 10).  Most data fields are drop-down lists.  This reduces the amount of text that needs to be entered using  the Tablet PC stylus and also improves data quality because it means that inappropriate codes cannot  be entered.  By default all data fields are set at ‘-9’ or ‘missing value’ until you interact with them and  enter an appropriate piece of information.  In completing an RHS form all ‘-9s’ and ‘missing value’  selections are replaced by data.                                                        Figure 10  Screen shot of part of Page 1 of RAPID.    The purpose of the buttons at the top of the window (Figure 10) is as follows: 27  About database: provides basic contact details and ownership information.  Main menu: returns you to the opening menu screen of RAPID  Survey Notes: opens a text box linked to a particular survey, for entering necessary field notes  RHS manual: opens an electronic version of the 2003 RHS guidance manual, complete with example  pictures of all hydromorphological features recorded in a survey.  Check Data: on completion of an RHS survey you must press this button to validate the data you have  entered.  RAPID will check, sequentially from the start of the form to the finish, for data fields that  have been left empty by mistake and where possible, for inconsistencies in the data entered.  RAPID  will only display one error at a time (so that you have the opportunity to correct the problem).  Once  you have corrected the problem you must press the Check Data button again to find the next error (if  there is one).  Once the validation is successfully finished, RAPID produces a message ‘This RHS  survey appears to be complete’.  This validation must be performed before you leave the site, in order  that any omissions can be accurately corrected.    When you select ‘Input Survey data’ from the main menu you are first asked to select the CS square  for which you wish to enter data.  Use the ‘Select Square’ drop down list in the top right-hand corner  of the window.  You then proceed to complete the form as normal, complying with standard RHS protocol, ensuring  that all fields are completed.  IF, FOR WHATEVER REASON, YOU CANNOT CARRY OUT THE RHS AT A SQUARE, THEN YOU SHOULD  STILL SELECT THAT SQAURE IN RAPID, ENTER THE DATE, SURVEYOR NAME AND IN THE SURVEY NOTES  PROVIDE A REASON FOR NOT COMPLETING THE SURVEY.  Page 1  Section A Field Survey Details: You must record the GPS-derived NGR for spot-check 1, 6 and 50m  beyond spot-check 10.  This can be done by returning to this section as you proceed through  the survey.  By clicking the ‘Today’ button adjacent to the box you can automatically  complete the box with that day’s date.  Select the surveyor’s name and RHS accreditation  code from the drop-down list.  You are asked to decide whether the watercourse is natural or  artificial.  The associated help button provides definitions for both types of watercourse.  Section B Valley Form: This section does not differ in content from the paper form, but has a slightly  different arrangement of the options.  Section C Number of Riffles, Pools and Point Bars: This section does not differ in content from the  paper form.  Section D Artificial Features: This section does not differ in content from the paper form, but has a  slightly different arrangement of the options.  You should first tick the box near the top-left of  the section which will turn all the -9s in the section to zeros.  Then you can enter counts for  those artificial features that are present, if any.    Page 2: Spot-checks  The design of Page 2 differs from that of the paper form.  Each of the 10 spot-checks and the summary  channel vegetation and extra substrate section are on separate tabbed pages nested within Page 2.  A  blue bar underneath the tab numbers indicates which tab is currently selected (Fig 11).  The drop-down  boxes provide you with all valid options, both in code and with description, for each spot-check  attribute.  This design aids data-entry.  You are reminded on the tabs for spot-checks 1, 6 and 10 to  record the GPS readings.  You must record whether Spot-check 1 is at the up- or downstream end of  the site.  This is recorded in the drop-down box above the tabbed section (Fig 11). 28  Each spot-check tab also features a ‘Check’ button (located at the right-hand side of Section F) which,  when clicked, will confirm that there are no missing data or omissions for that spot-check.  It is good  practice to use this button before you move to the next spot-check to ensure that you have completed  all the necessary tasks.                                          Figure 11  Screen shot of the Page 2 spot-check form in RAPID.    Section E Physical Attributes: This section does not differ in content from the paper form, but has a  slightly different arrangement of the options.  You are allowed to enter a maximum of two  codes for bank modifications and marginal& bank features on each bank.  If you need to enter  more than two codes then use the survey notes.  The same applies for channel modifications  and features.  It should be noted that you nee to interact with all the drop-downs.  So even if  you wish to record only one bank modification sat this spot-check, you still need to change the  optional second drop-down to NO (none).  Section F Banktop Land-use and Vegetation Structure: This section does not differ in content from the  paper form, but has a slightly different arrangement of the options.  Section G Channel Vegetation Types: This section does not differ in content from the paper form, but  has a slightly different arrangement of the options.  If there are some vegetation types present you will need to interact with all boxes, even those  for types not present, to actively record that they are absent. 29  If there is no channel vegetation, or less than 1% channel vegetation, at the spot-check, then  select ‘No plants’ from the ‘Update all to:’ drop-down to the right in the blue section header  bar (Fig 11).  This will enter NO in all the boxes.  If the water is too turbid to make a judgement on the presence of submerged vegetation forms  then you should select ‘Submerged plants not visible’ from the ‘Update all to:’ drop-down.   This will enter NV in the boxes for the three submerged vegetation types.  If it is not possible to see the channel from your position at this spot-check and you therefore  cannot make any judgement on the presence of vegetation in the channel you can select  ‘Whole channel not visible’ from the ‘Update all to:’ drop-down.  This will enter NV in boxes  for all vegetation types.    The last spot-check tab on page 2 (‘Overall tab’) is for entering extra channel substrates that were not  not recorded in any of the 10 spot-checks but are present in >1% of the whole 500 m site (Fig 12).  A  summary of the substrates that were recorded at the 10 spot-checks is provided to the right of the drop- down boxes.  If there are no extra substrates to record then you must still interact with all three boxes,  entering ‘None’.  The Overall tab on Page 2 also contains a section for recording the overall presence of vegetation  types present along the whole 500 m site (Fig 12).  This could also include types not recorded in any  of the spot-checks.  Only record vegetation types that cover >1% of the whole 500 m site.  Next to  each drop-down box there is a tally of the number of times that vegetation type has been recorded as  present or extensive in the 10 spot-checks.  This should assist you in completing this section.  Again  all boxes will need to be interacted with to remove -9s.                                Figure 12  Screen shot of the Overall tab on the Page 2 spot-check form in RAPID. 30  Page 3: 500 m Sweep-up  Section H Land-use within 50 m of Banktop: This section does not differ in content from the paper  form, and has an almost identical arrangement of the options (Fig 13).  You should first tick  the box near the top-left of the section which will turn all the -9s in the section to zeros.  Then  you can enter data for those land-uses that are present.  Section I Bank Profiles: This section does not differ in content from the paper form, and has an almost  identical arrangement of the options (Fig 13).  You should first tick the box near the top-left of  the section which will turn all the -9s in the section to zeros.  Then you can enter data for those  natural and artificial/modified bank profiles that are present.                                                      Figure 13  Screen shot of upper half of Page 3 form in RAPID.    Section J Extent of Tress and Associated Features: This section does not differ in content from the  paper form, but does have a slightly different arrangement of the options (Fig 14).  If there are 31  no trees or none of the associated features present at the RHS site then you can just tick the  box in the top left-hand corner of the section to move all the -9s to zeros.  Alternatively you  just complete each of the drop-down boxes appropriately.  Section K Extent of Channel and Bank Features: This section does not differ in content from the paper  form, and has an almost identical arrangement of the options (Fig 14).  You should first tick  the box near the top-left of the section which will turn all the -9s in the section to zeros.  Then  you can enter data for those features that are present.                                                    Figure 14  Screen shot of lower half of Page 3 form in RAPID. 32  Page 4: Dimensions and Influences  Section L Channel Dimensions: This section does not differ in content from the paper form, and has a  similar layout.  Use the numerical drop-down lists to record the measured dimensions (Fig 15).  Section M Features of Special Interest: This section does not differ in content from the paper form,  and has an almost identical arrangement of the options (Fig 15).  You should first tick the box  near the top-left of the section which will turn all the -9s in the section to zeros.  Then you can  enter data for those features that are present.

Section O Notable Nuisance Plant Species: This section does not differ in content from the paper form,  and has an almost identical arrangement of the options (Fig 16).  You should first tick the box  near the top-left of the section which will turn all the -9s in the section to zeros.  Then you can  enter data for those plant species that are present.  Section P Overall Characteristics: This section does not differ in content from the paper form.   However it does have a different arrangement of the options (Fig 16).  You should first tick the  box near the top-left of the section which will turn all the -9s in the section to zeros.  Then you  can select from the drop-down menu those characteristics that are present.  Up to six different  characteristics can be recorded within each category.  If more are required then use the survey  notes page.  Section S Alders: This section does not differ in content from the paper form, and has a similar layout  (Fig 16).                                                  Figure 16  Screen shot of lower half of Page 4 form in RAPID. 34  Validating data  Once you have completed the survey you must validate the form, while still at the site in order that any  omissions can be accurately corrected.  RAPID has an in-built validation routine that can be activated  by pressing the ‘Check data’ button at the top left hand corner of the window.  RAPID will check,  sequentially from the start of the form to the finish, for data fields that have been left empty by mistake  and where possible, for inconsistencies in the data entered.  RAPID will only display one error at a  time (so that you have the opportunity to correct the problem).  Once you have corrected the problem  you must press the Check Data button again to find the next error (if there is one).  Once the validation  is successfully finished, RAPID produces a message ‘This RHS survey appears to be complete’ (Fig  17).  You can now close down RAPID by returning to the main menu and clicking EXIT.                                              Figure 17  Screen shot of the completed form in RAPID. 35  Aquatic plant survey  General principle  The aquatic plant (macrophytes and bryophytes) survey method used in CS2000 will be repeated for  CS2007.  The simple field protocol is based on that described for the Mean Trophic Rank (MTR)  bioassessment method (Holmes et al. 1999).  The MTR system is a biological method to assess the trophic status of streams and rivers in the UK  and was primarily developed to monitor the impacts of eutrophication.  The MTR system is based on  the presence and abundance of species of aquatic macrophyte.  A macrophyte is defined as ‘any plant  observable with the naked eye and nearly always identifiable when observed’ (Holmes & Whitton  1977).  This definition includes all higher aquatic plants, vascular cryptograms and bryophytes,  together with groups of algae which can be seen to be composed predominantly of a single species  (Holmes et al. 1999).  A 100 m reach of watercourse is carefully walked by the surveyor and the presence and cover (on a 9- point scale) of all macrophyte and bryophyte species is recorded.  The 100 m reach is centred on the  macroinvertebrate sampling location.  Supplementary information is also collected on the physical  nature of the 100 m reach.  The surveyor is encouraged to collect samples of plants that it is not  possible to confidently identify in the field.  These are identified in the laboratory and/or passed to a  designated external expert for confirmation.  Only those plants seen submerged or partly submerged in the river, at low flow levels, within the 100  m survey length are included.  At the sides of the channel all macrophytes rooted or attached on parts  of the substrata which are likely to be submerged for more than 85% of the year are also included  (Holmes et al. 1999).  Survey technique (from Holmes et al. 1999)  You must first define the 100 m survey length by measuring out 50 m upstream and 50 m downstream  of the centrepoint of the macroinvertebrate sampling site (Fig 1).  You will be provided with copies of  the hand-drawn MTR survey length sketch maps from CS2000 which will aid you in relocating the  100 m survey length.  At sites where it is safe to do so, the full 100 m survey length and channel width should be surveyed  by wading through the stream.  Wading should be in an upstream direction so that any substrate  disturbed does not obscure the visibility of the survey length, both for ease of observation and safety  reasons.  Where all but a small proportion (<20%) of the survey length is accessible by wading it is acceptable  to walk for a short distance along the banks observing the macrophytes and to investigate submerged  macrophytes using a grapnel.  You should wade in a zig-zag manner across the channel, frequently investigating all habitat types  present.  You should cross the channel a minimum of 4 times in each 10 m stretch (Fig 18).  At sites where the channel is too deep to wade, if channel macrophytes can be clearly seen by walking  along both banks then this is sufficient.  Use a grapnel to retrieve macrophyte species from the  channel for identification.  The grapnel should not be used blindly to ‘search’ for plants; its use  should be reserved only for retrieving specimens for identification or to determine if macrophytes are  present.  Grapnels should be used with care as they can cause damage to plant beds; this is  particularly pertinent in areas of high conservation value.  As you wade/walk you should record the species present (calling out species names to the recorder  following along bankside) and think about the percentage of the 10 m survey areas covered by each  species.  Take particular care to examine all small niches within the survey site to look for small  patches (<25 cm2) of species.  Such patches are easily overlooked but their omission can result in  substantial error in the final site assessment. 36                    Figure 18  Diagrammatic representation of wading technique that should be adopted for every 10 m of an  MTR survey.  Detached macrophyte material, except for actual floating macrophyte species such as Lemna sp. and  Azolla, should be disregarded.  If a macrophyte is stranded above the water e.g. in low flow  conditions, then it should not be recorded on the standard list.  A note of the species, should however,  be made in the survey notes along with observations of the amount stranded and any obvious reasons  for stranding.  Specimens attached to artificial structures should be recorded but with a note made in the survey  notes stating the nature of the structure.  Once all macrophyte species in the survey length have been recorded, wade/walk back along the the  survey length, specifically observing the amount of each species present and the overall percentage of  the channel covered by macrophyte growth.  For all percentage cover estimates of species, the whole survey area surveyed equals 100%, i.e. the  individual species percentage cover estimates are a percentage of the whole survey area and NOT of  the overall percentage cover estimate.  It is good practice to consult with the other surveyor when estimating percentage cover.  Record the  agreed species cover value (Table 3) for each species and the overall percentage cover of  macrophytes.  If you estimate that the percentage cover for a species is exactly on the boundary  between two species cover values, then you should record it as the higher (greater cover) of the two  categories.  Table 3 Species cover categories for a 100 m MTR survey  Species Cover Value  Percentage cover range  1  <0.1%  2  0.1 – 1%  3  1 – 2.5%  4  2.5 – 5%  5  5 – 10%  6  10 – 25%  7  25 – 50%  8  50 – 75%  9  >75%    0 m  10 m  Right  Bank  Left  Bank  Flow 37  When assigning percentage cover to species and estimating overall percentage cover, it is strongly  recommended that you use a systematic approach to make the process easier and more accurate.  Percentage cover should be estimated by imagining a bird’s eye view of the channel. For estimates of  individual species, it is necessary to imagine the cover of each, regardless of whether several species  are intermingled or overlap.  Percentage cover estimation of filamentous algae can be particularly  difficult. Determine whether the algae are forming a continuous or broken covering of the substrate.  For both overall percentage cover and individual species cover estimation it is useful to calculate what  a one metre square patch of macrophyte represents for each survey length, eg 0.01%, 0.5% etc, before  commencing surveying.  As a double-check when estimating small areas of cover, it may be useful to  work out beforehand the area of pieces of survey equipment, and use these for reference: for example,  an A4 sheet (0.06 m2).                                                      Suggested techniques for estimating overall macrophyte percentage cover  Option 1: Imagine moving all the macrophytes to the one end of the survey length.  The area covered will  correspond to the overall percentage cover, for example in a 100m survey length an area of macrophytes  completely covering a section which is 25m long x channel width will have 25% cover.  Option 2: If the majority of the vegetation is confined to strips along the margins of the river, the overall  percentage cover may be estimated in the following manner:  Marginal area covered, m2 = length of marginal vegetation cover x width of marginal vegetation  Total area covered, m2 = marginal area + other areas  Total percentage cover = [(total area covered)/(total area of survey length)] x 100  Suggested techniques for estimating indivdual macrophyte species percentage cover  Square meter method:  1. Estimate the approximate average width of the channel.  2. Calculate the equivalent m2 areas that need to be covered in order for a macrophyte to be awarded a  particular species cover value.  Refer to Table 4, highlight the most appropriate channel width column and  use this as a guide.  3. Estimate the m2 cover of each species within the survey length and allocate the appropriate species cover  value.  Example  For a 100m survey length, channel width 5 m, a macrophyte must cover the following areas:    Species Cover Value  Percentage cover range  Equivalent area (m2)  1  <0.1%  < 0.5  2  0.1 – 1%  0.5 - 5  3  1 – 2.5%  5 - 12.5  4  2.5 – 5%  12.5 - 25  5  5 – 10%  25 - 50  6  10 – 25%  50 - 125  7  25 – 50%  125 - 250  8  50 – 75%  250 - 375  9  >75%  > 375  A macrophyte covering 6m2 would be recorded as species cover value 3.  These figures need to be  recalculated for ANY DIFFERENCE in channel width. 38  Table 4 An aid to converting surface areas (m2) within a 100m MTR survey length to percentage cover and ultimately a species cover value, for channels of different widths.

We have produced a list of 351  plant taxa that we believe contains all the aquatic macrophytes that are likely to be recorded  during CS2007.  This list also acts as the standard for the taxonomic level to which  specimens should be taken when being identified.  For example we would expect Carex to be  identified to species level but would not expect Salix to be taken beyond genus.  We would  hope that the vast majority of specimens could be taken to species.  Use a field identification guide.  If identification to species level is expected but cannot be  achieved due to the absence of key/seasonal features e.g. flowers, then record it only to the  level to which you are confident.  If you are unable to confidently identify a species in the  field due to being unfamiliar to you then you should take a representative sample back to the  laboratory for confirmation.  This should be a placed in a plastic bag or tube without water  and labelled with the CS Square number and temporary ID code e.g. 160_01 and date.  This  coding should match that recorded on the MTR form so that the confirmed identification can  be linked back to the appropriate survey.  This is particularly important when more than one  macrophyte from the same survey needs further investigation.  Particular care should be taken over the identification of Ranunculus species, as it is known  that mis-identification of Ranunculus species is a common cause of surveyor error.  If in  doubt, a representative sample should be taken back to the laboratory for confirmation of  identification, or identification confirmed by an expert.  Where you are confident that two or  even more species or apparently differing forms of Ranunculus are present, but you cannot be  confident about the precise species, then it is preferable to take sample specimens for  confirmation back in the laboratory.  Representative samples of algae and bryophytes should be taken to the laboratory for closer  examination so that their identification can be confirmed.  Assessing and recording physical variables (from Holmes et al. 1999)  After recording the macrophyte information re-traverse the survey length, recording details of  the survey length physical variables (water width, depth, bed stability, substrate composition,  habitats, channel shading and water clarity).  The assessment of physical variables is NOT  expected to be as precise as the macrophyte assessments, but merely an important element  which should be used to help in:  i) Assessment of how comparable sites are to one another.  ii) Providing information which in the future may help in more rigorously assessing  the relationship between macrophytes and physical variables.  Orientation of the left and right banks is determined by the direction of flow. When facing  downstream, the left bank is on your left hand side and the right bank on your right hand side.  Recording of features which are present in less than 1% of the survey area will not usually be  required unless that particular habitat type contains the only occurrence of a particular  macrophyte species.  If this is necessary then use the survey notes to record the feature with a  cover of <1%.  Water width: The width is the channel width for which macrophyte species have been  recorded, including any area of substratum above the actual water level that has been  surveyed.  If the width varies noticeably along the survey length then several width  measurements should be made.  Record varying widths by entering the percentage of  the 100 m survey length in each width category.  The total must sum to 100%. 40  Depth: Measure the depth to the nearest cm at various points along the survey length — the  number and exact location of the measurement points should depend on the variability  of depths encountered when surveying for macrophytes.  Record the percentage of the  survey length in each of the depth category.  The total must sum to 100%.    Bed stability: The following 4 classes are used to define bed stability:      Solid/firmly bedded - eg bedrock/compacted clay, increased flow has little  effect      Stable - eg boulders/pebbles/gravel, unlikely to be significantly altered by  increased flows      Unstable - eg gravel/sand/silt/mud, likely to be dislodged by increased flows      Soft/sinking - eg deep silt/mud, makes channel unwadeable, bank stick  penetrates easily into substrate.  Record the percentage of the channel in each of the above bed stability categories.   The total must sum to 100%.  Substrate: Estimates should be based on a birds-eye view and should only include particles  which are visible and the equivalent superficial layer under macrophytes. If shapes of  underlying larger particles are distinct under a layer of fine particles such as silt or  clay then the larger particles should be recorded. When the shapes of underlying  particles are not distinct then the fine particles should be recorded. If you feel this is  not sufficient then extra information can be recorded in the Survey Notes.  Record the percentage cover for each substrate type present in the survey length.  The  total must sum to 100%.  The substrata classes are:  Bedrock - exposure of underlying rock not covered by alluvial deposits    Boulders/Cobbles - > 64mm (half-fist size or larger)    Pebbles/Gravel - > 2–64 mm (half fist to coffee granule size)    Sand - > 0.0625–2mm (smaller than coffee granules and unlike silt/clay,  abrasive to the hands)    Silt/Clay - < 0.0625mm (have a soft texture)     Peat - dead vegetation undergoing bacterial decay in stagnant deoxygenated  water – strictly pure peat, not fine peaty deposits over more substantial  substrate.     Artificial – man-made substrates in the channel e.g. concrete bed.  See Fig 7 in RIVPACS site environmental data section for illustration of different  substrate sizes.  The actual measurements given relate to the longest axis of each particle. Any rock  with one or more sides greater than 256mm long is classed as a boulder.  When  irregular shaped particles are observed the longest axis length determines category  assignment. 41  Habitats: Record the percentage cover for each habitat type present within the survey length.   The habitat types are POOL, RUN, RIFFLE and SLACK, as defined below.  The total  must sum to 100%.  Note that although these definitions are similar to those used for many other  biological surveys, they are NOT the definitions used for the River Habitat Survey  methodology (Environment Agency 2003).  Pool - Either a discrete area of slow flowing water, usually relatively deeper  than surrounding water, or between faster flowing stretches, as in a sequence  of riffle-pool- riffle.  Pools are deep and often turbulent, and scoured during  spate flows.  Riffle - Fast flowing, shallow water whose surface is distinctly disturbed.   This does not include water whose surface is disturbed by macrophyte growth  only.  Run - Fast or moderate flowing, often deeper water whose surface is rarely  brokenor disturbed except for occasional swirls and eddies.  Slack - Deep, slow flowing water, uniform in character.  Channel shading: Record the percentage of the channel area affected by shading, NOT the  percentage of the bank on which vegetation causing shade stands.  The shading for  each bank is recorded separately.  Estimate the percentage of the whole channel area  surveyed that is shaded by vegetation/structures from the left bank when the sun is  directly overhead (ie at 12 noon).  In a similar manner, estimate the percentage of the  whole channel shaded from the right bank.  The total for each bank must sum to  100%.  Three shade categories, none, broken and dense, are defined:  None - no shading  Broken - some direct sunlight hits the water surface in the shade-affected area  when the sun is directly overhead.  Dense - 5% or less of the shade-affected area receives direct sunlight when  the sun is directly overhead.  Water clarity: Record the percentage of the channel in each water clarity category.  More than  one category may be present as a survey length may be clear in the shallow margins  and progress through cloudy to turbid as the water depth increases.  Clear - Channel substrate is clearly visible at all depths, as are macrophyte  species.  Cloudy - Slightly discoloured with a moderate load of suspended solids and  partially reduced light penetration.  All clumps of macrophyte species can be  located on the substrate of the river channel but the view of them is partially  distorted.  A small piece/single shoot of a macrophyte species may be missed.  Turbid - Strongly discoloured, carrying a heavy load of suspended solids and  having greatly restricted light penetration.  The channel bed is obscured and  submerged macrophyte species are indistinguishable from substrate and  water.  This will lead to a reduction in accuracy and efficiency of the method. 42  IRIS  We will be using a field digital data entry system, called IRIS, to record the aquatic plant  survey data in the field.  This will reduce the likelihood of errors associated with transferring  data from paper copy to a database and save staff time.  The design of IRIS is based on that of the paper forms used for carrying out standard MTR  surveys.  IRIS is an MS Access database designed to capture and store aquatic plant cover data in the  field using a tablet PC.  You simply double-click the IRIS icon on the desktop to open the application.  Then you select from the opening form whether you wish to input survey data for a new site,  export data from an existing site or exit the database (Fig 19).                  Figure 19  Desktop icon and screen shot of the opening menu screen of IRIS, the aquatic plant  survey field digital data entry system.  The data entry form consists of 2 pages.  Page 1 gathers general survey information and the  plant cover data (Fig 20).  Page 2 is where the physical site data is entered.  You can switch  between the pages using the page buttons at the top of the window (Fig 20).  Most data fields are drop-down lists.  This reduces the amount of text that needs to be entered  using the tablet PC stylus and also improves data quality because it means that inappropriate  data cannot be entered.  The purpose of the other buttons at the top of the window (Fig 20) is as follows:  About database: provides basic contact details and ownership information.  Main menu: returns you to the opening menu screen of IRIS.  Survey Notes: opens a text box linked to a particular survey, for entering necessary field  notes.  Check Data: on completion of an aquatic plant survey you must press this button to validate  the data you have entered.  IRIS will check, sequentially from the start of the form to the  finish, for data fields that have been left empty by mistake and where possible, for  inconsistencies in the data entered.  IRIS will only display one error at a time (so that you have the opportunity to correct the  problem).  Once you have corrected the problem you must press the ‘Check Data’ button  again to find the next error (if there is one).  Once the validation is successfully finished, IRIS  produces a message ‘This plant survey appears to be complete’. 43  This validation must be performed before you leave the site, in order that any omissions can  be accurately corrected.    Inputting survey data  The first task when inputting survey data is to select the Countryside Survey square that you  are in.  Use the ‘Select Square’ drop down list.  Enter the date and the name of the surveyor in the river actually carrying out the survey (not  the recorder holding the tablet PC).  Also record the NGR of the mid-point of the site.  This  should also be the mid-point of the macroinvertebrate sampling area.  IF, FOR WHATEVER REASON, YOU CANNOT CARRY OUT THE PLANT SURVEY AT A SQUARE, THEN  YOU SHOULD STILL SELECT THAT SQAURE IN IRIS, ENTER THE DATE, SURVEYOR NAME AND IN  THE SURVEY NOTES PROVIDE A REASON FOR NOT COMPLETING THE SURVEY.  You then proceed to complete the form as normal, complying with standard MTR protocols,  described above, and ensuring that all fields are completed.  You add species to the list (from the drop-down menu) as you find them within the 100 m site  and you then allocate a cover category to each species based on its % cover within the survey  site.  Species are listed according to major group (Fungi, Algae, Moss, Liverworts, Horsetails &  Quillworts, Ferns, Monocotyledons, and Dicotyledons) and then within a group they are  alphabetically ordered.  A species entry can be deleted by right-clicking on the grey squares to the left of the species  name and selecting ‘Cut’ and then clicking ‘Yes’.                                Figure 20  Screen shot of the aquatic plant survey field digital data entry system (IRIS). 44  IF THERE ARE NO PLANTS RECORDED IN 100M STRECTH THEN SELECT ‘NO SPECIES ENTERED’  FROM THE DROP-DOWN SPECIES LIST.  YOU MUST STILL RECORD THE PHYSICAL DATA ON PAGE  2 OF THE FORM EVEN IF NO PLANTS ARE FOUND.  Specimen samples of any plants that you have been unable to identify need to be taken for  identification by experts.  These samples need bagged and labelled correctly to ensure that  once identified the information can be inserted into the right survey.  IRIS has pre-named  entries in the drop down-list for indeterminate mosses, algae and others e.g. Algae 01, Moss  01, Other 01.  Further details of the number of Algae, Moss and Other sample specimens taken and how they  were labelled needs to be entered for reference, at the bottom of page 1 (Fig 21).  IRIS  suggests a consistent format for labelling sample specimens i.e. 15_Main Moss 1 where the  first number is the CS square and the second term is the number of that moss specimen from  that survey.                                      Figure 21  Screen shot of page 1 of IRIS    On Page 2 of IRIS you record the physical data for the survey length (Fig 22).  For each of the  seven physical features for which you are recording data (water width, depth, bed stability,  substrate composition, habitats, channel shading and water clarity) you simply select the  category present at the site from the drop-down list and assign a percentage cover value to the  category from the adjacent drop-down list.  IRIS will tally up the percentages automatically to 45  ensure that the total 100%.  The ‘SUM’ boxes go from red to grey when the total equals  100%.  You should also record how many photographs you have taken and provide some  accompanying notes.  Once you have completed the survey you must validate the form, while still at the site, in  order that any omissions can be accurately corrected.  Click the ‘Check Data’ button to  validate the data you have entered.  IRIS will check, sequentially from the start of the form to  the finish, for data fields that have been left empty by mistake and where possible, for  inconsistencies in the data entered.                                                      Figure 22  Screen shot of the Page 2 form in IRIS. 46    IRIS will only display one error at a time (so that you have the opportunity to correct the  problem).  Once you have corrected the problem you must press the ‘Check Data’ button  again to find the next error (if there is one).  Once the validation is successfully finished, IRIS  produces a message; ‘This plant survey appears to be complete’ (Fig. 23).  You can now close down RAPID by returning to the main menu and clicking EXIT.                                Figure 23  Screen shot of the data export form in IRIS. 47  Field Survey check-list  Upon completing all the tasks at the headwater stream site and before leaving the site, it is  very important that both surveyors, together, complete the field survey check-list (Fig 24) to  ensure that all tasks have in fact been completed.  It is quite easy to over-look a task,  especially if field and/or weather conditions are difficult.    Quality control and assurance  The following quality control measures will operate  •  All surveyors undertaking River Habitat Surveys will be holders of the Environment  Agency certificate for this technique.  •  All field surveyors will be trained in the techniques of RIVPACS-compliant  macroinvertebrate sampling, MTR-compliant aquatic plant surveying and chemical  sampling prior to undertaking the survey.  •  The component members of field survey teams will be regularly swapped to make  sure that teams do not diverge with time in terms of the sampling techniques that they  use.  •  Approximately 7% of all headwater sites will be audited by an experienced CEH staff  member.  All tasks will be repeated by the auditor.  •  Teams may also be accompanied while in the field by an experienced CEH staff  member to discuss progress and assess the quality of their work directly. 48  •  Headwaters field survey checklist  CS SQUARE              DATE  Surveyor A (RHS/macroinvertebrate sampling)  Surveyor B (aquatic plants)  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Is this one of the 25 squares with a new headwater sampling site?  146  161  234  269  331  366  433  494  503  535  569  572  602  626  631  644  648  699  887  910  958  998  1113  1212  1241  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The watercourse is a: Natural headwater stream  Artifical drain or ditch        This information should also have been recorded on Page 1 in RAPID    Is running water present at the site?  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Macroinvertebrate sample taken  Number of sample pots  Site map drawn (on reverse side of RIVPACS Sample Area Form)  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  River Habitat Survey completed & validated  Which RHS spot-check transect contains the invert sampling site?  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Conductivity and pH recorded  SRP.

The storage box itself should also be labelled  with a Transport Emergency (TREM) card (Fig 25).  The TREM card provides important  relevant information on the nature of the liquids contained within the box and any hazards that  may be associated with them.  It also provides information on what action to take in case of  spillage and emergency contact details.  Figure 25  Transport emergency card (TREM card) for samples in fixative carried by road.

APPLIES ONLY DURING ROAD TRANSPORT 50  All macroinvertebrate sample pots and plant specimens should be carefully catalogued and  stored at your CEH base until you have a sufficient quantity (6-8) to courier to CEH Dorset  for processing.  The samples should be sent as soon as you have enough to fill a box.  Do not  store the pots at your base for any longer than necessary; the sooner we can start processing  the samples the better.  Only 6-8 pots should sent per box.  It is sufficient to use a strong, used but undamaged  cardboard box.  Thoroughly check that all pots are tightly closed with their lids PVC taped for  extra security.  Place each pot in plastic sample bag.  Place the pots upright in the box and use  some form of packaging filler e.g. bubble wrap to ensure that the pots cannot shift around  within the box while in transit.  Attach a TREM card to the box.  The box should be sent to:  Dr. John Murphy  Centre for Ecology and Hydrology  FBA River Laboraotory  East Stoke  Wareham BH20 6BB……………………………………………………  An email should also be sent to jomu@ceh.ac.uk to inform them that samples have been sent  and detailed which samples are in the box.  The staff in Dorset will reply to your email when  the samples have safely arrived and the contents are as expected.  The plant specimens collected for confirmation of ID should be posted or couriered to CEH in  Dorset.  Ensure that all bags and tubes are clearly labelled and secure.  Depending on the  volume of material, they may be sent in an envelope or box.  Please adhere to similar  precautions and protocols as for the macroinvertebrate samples. 51  References  Environment Agency (2003) River Habitat Survey in Britain and Ireland: Field Survey  Guidance Manual 2003 version.

This will be done by mappers.  This information will be recorded on the paper  CS2007 Pond Mapping Recording Sheet and given to freshwater surveyors.  Further information on identifying ponds is included in the habitat mapping handbook in the  section headed “Further information on identification and mapping of ponds”.  In summary,  the definition of a pond used for CS2007 is “a body of standing water 25 m2 to 2 ha in area  which usually holds water for at least four months of the year”.  The area is based on the  outer pond area defined by the maximum winter water level which may be different from the  current area of water.  The definition includes all types of water bodies including temporary  ponds; ponds which are dry at the time of survey will be recorded on the CS2007 Pond  Mapping Recording Sheet and should be included as survey ponds.  Once details of all ponds are recorded on the Pond Mapping Recording Sheet, the mapper  will select the one pond (in every square that contains ponds) for condition assessment.  This  consists of a survey for macrophytes, environmental characteristics and water chemistry.   This pond is named the “survey pond”.  Once mapping of all the ponds in the square is complete and the mapper has identified the  survey pond, they will give you the Pond Mapping Recording Sheet.  It contains data on all  the ponds in the square, and it is your responsibility to return this to Pond Conservation with  the other paper forms.  Details of how to do this are at the end of this section.  Two surveyors will need to work together to carry out the pond condition assessment to  minimise Health and Safety risks associated with working with water.  Standard Health and  Safety guidelines for fieldwork with water apply.  In addition, surveyors should be aware of the  additional risks in ponds, particularly from (i) floating mats of emergent plants and floating fen  or bog which should always be avoided (ii) false bases of surface-dried mud or submerged plant  mats (iii) uneven bases – ponds often have holes, rapid changes in slope and underwater objects  which are not visible in turbid water (iv) deep silt, which can be dangerous.  A strong pole (e.g.  a pond net) should always be available as a safety aid for testing the pond base when wading in  the water, and if the surveyor is in any doubt they should not proceed.  The two surveyors should decide how to split the survey tasks between them, and one  should take responsibility for checking all fieldsheets are complete, storing fieldsheets,  plant specimens and water samples and dispatching them as agreed.  A copy of the pond condition survey fieldsheet is included at the end of this manual.    POND CONDITION ASSESSMENT METHOD 53  Steps in carrying out the pond condition survey  1. Obtain from mappers the completed “CS2000 Pond Mapping Recording Sheet”  which will identify the survey pond.  2. Write the square number, pond identification code number and GPS location on the  condition survey recording forms.  3. Take a photo of the pond with the square number written on chalkboard.  4. If there is enough water in the pond, take the water chemistry sample and meter  readings and make turbidity estimate before the water is disturbed.  The survey pond  may contain little or no water at the time of survey.  If it is completely dry, or just  contains wet mud, it will not be possible to take a water chemistry sample.    5. Carry out the environmental survey (including amenity use).  6. Carry out the macrophyte survey.  7. Check all sections of fieldsheet are complete and stapled together.  8. Dispatch water samples.  9. Gather and store all fieldsheets and plant specimens and dispatch at least monthly.    Ponds on the boundary of a square  Where a pond falls on the boundary of a square so only part of it is inside the square this will  have been included in mapping the square for the number of ponds, but only the area inside  the square will have been included in the area measured.  For the condition survey you should  survey the entire pond including the area outside the square    Filling in the fieldsheet  Complete the fieldsheet in pencil.  The identification number of the survey pond will be on  the Pond Mapping Recording Sheet.  Record any location information that will make it easier  to find the pond again for the next Countryside Survey      Taking the water chemistry sample and readings  Overview  If there is sufficient water in the pond, and before the water is disturbed, estimate the water  turbidity and take water chemistry sample and meter readings.  If there is not sufficient water  to do this record this in the box on the fieldsheet.  A single chemical sample will be taken from a typical area of the pond using the same  methods as used for headwaters.    Avoid taking samples near to inflows.  If there is an outflow present take the water sample at  this point.  The following elements will be measured at each pond site.  •  Conductivity and pH: field measurement  •  Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), total oxidisable nitrogen (TON), alkalinity:  50  ml filtered 54  Estimating turbidity  Estimate the turbidity of the water by looking down into c.30cm depth of water in the pond.   Classify the turbidity of the water into one of the following four categories: clear, moderately  clear, moderately turbid or turbid.    Take the meter readings for conductivity and pH  Enter the water and rinse the two 1 l wide-neck bottles 3 times.  Then move a few steps away  from the disturbed area and fill the bottles with undisturbed water without disturbing any  sediments.  Avoid collecting plant material.  Using the hand-held meter provided, measure the pH and conductivity (note units –  conductivity should be in µS cm-1) by placing the probes in one of the collected 1 l sample  bottle, immediately after the sample has been taken.  Both meters will need a few minutes to  stabilise and may need to be stirred as the readings settle.  Record the readings on the  fieldsheet.  Prior to measurement, ensure that the pH and conductivity probrs have been well-rinsed since  use at the previous site and are properly calibrated.    Taking the water chemistry sample for SRP, TON, alkalinity and DOC  Use the second 1L bottle of water from the pond to obtain the filtered water sample needed  for the analysis of these parameters.  Filtering will be done on site using disposable 0.45 µm  pore size syringe filters.  Use a black indelible marker to label the outside of a 50 ml (SRP/TON/Alk) plastic sample  bottle with the following information before it gets wet.   type of habitat – “POND”  type of water sample - “SRP/TON/Alk”  kilometre square number  date as day-month-year (e.g. 07-08-06).    Wash the syringe by twice filling the syringe chamber with some of the water sample and  emptying it on to the ground.  Then fill the syringe chamber again with sample water and  attach a new disposable filter cartridge.  Then empty the water in the chamber, through the  filter, into the 50 ml plastic sample bottle.  Rinse the sample bottles out with this water.  Do  not exert excessive pressure as this might rupture the filter.  Fill the syringe chamber once more with some of the water sample, re-attach the same filter  cartridge and fill the 50 ml plastic sample bottle.  Screw on the lid tightly and place in the  appropriate (pre-addressed and postage-paid) padded envelope.  If the filter cartridge becomes blocked during filtration then change and continue with more  of unfiltered water sample.  After filtering, check the filtered sample for suspended material  e.g. from a ruptured filter paper.  If suspended material is present then discard the filtered  sample and start again.  Tick the boxes on the fieldsheet to confirm the samples have been taken. 55  Carrying out the environmental survey (including amenity use)  Overview  In summary the procedure is as follows:  o Take a photo of the pond  o Identify the outer boundary of the pond  o Walk the pond perimeter, noting relevant features on the fieldsheet as you go (e.g.  presence of inflows, surrounding landuse and waterbodies etc.)  o Draw a sketch of the pond outline and estimate pond size  o Fill in the rest of the fieldsheet.  Filling in some sections will require you to enter the  pond and so disturb the sediment: make sure water quality survey has been carried  out before you do this.    Photographing the pond  Take a photograph of the pond showing the square number written on the chalkboard.   Include the whole area of the pond if possible and any visible features which will help  identification of the same site in future.  Tick the box on the fieldsheet to confirm a photo has  been taken.    Identifying the outer boundary of the pond  The outer edge of the pond is defined as the 'upper level at which water stands in winter'. It  will usually be dry at the time of the survey.  The outer boundary can be identified from one  or more characteristics.  It is often identified by a change in the distribution of wetland  plants, particularly by a rapid transition to terrestrial species, often marked by a fringe of soft  rush.  Where solid features such as trees, walls or pipes occur within the water area a “water  mark” will usually be evident.  In some cases where willow trees are present a thick bundles  of fine roots out of the water can indicate the depth to which the roots have been submerged.   In some cases a break of slope will be present at the winter waterline. In ponds with outflows,  the level of the outflow will usually determine the upper winter water level.    Sketch the outline of the pond  Sketch the outline of the outer pond boundary.  This will help you estimate the pond area and  help confirm the identity of the pond in future surveys.  Note on the sketch any obvious  nearby features which will help identify the pond again e.g. wall / hedge / inflow.  Draw an appropriate scale bar (e.g. 10 m long) and indicate north.    Estimating the area of the pond  In order to estimate the area of the pond you need to know the length of your standard pace  and have practiced and checked your accuracy in pacing distances.  Pace the length and width  of the outer area of the pond (maximum winter water level).  Calculate the area by treating  the pond as a simple shape such as a circle or rectangle (or a number of joined shapes) and  adjusting the result to account for the difference between the actual pond shape and the shape  used for calculation.  For example if the pond is an oval approximately 10 metres long and 5  meters wide you could treat it as a rectangle of 50 m2, then decide to record an area of 45 m2  to account for its oval shape. 56  Remember the pond definition to be used for CS2007 is “a body of standing water from 25m2  (e.g. 5 m  x 5 m) to 2 ha (e.g. 200 m x 100 m) in area which usually holds water for four  months of the year or more”.    Measuring the drawdown height  The drawdown height is the vertical distance between the height of the maximum winter  water level and the actual water level at the time of survey.  It is not the horizontal distance or  the distance along the ground.  Measure this height using the distance markings on the handle of your pond net.  This is  easiest at a steep edge of the pond.      Estimating the proportion of water present in the pond.  Estimate the proportion of the area of water present in the pond at the time of survey relative  to the area covered when the pond is full to the maximum water level.  It may help to draw  the actual water level on your sketch.  The figures below show 75%, 50% and 25% of the  area of the pond covered with water.      Measuring sediment and water depths  Check that the water quality survey has been carried out before you enter the pond and  disturb the sediment.  Water depth and sediment depth are measured using the length markings on the handle of  your pond net.  To measure water depth put the pole into the water (net end upwards) and  note the depth at which the pole touches the top of the sediment. In most ponds you will feel  resistance from the sediment at this point, but where the sediment is very fine, you will need  to do this by eye.  You may see bubbles of gas released as the sediment is disturbed.  To  measure the total depth of sediment plus water push the pole down further until you reach the  solid base of the pond.  If it is possible to walk safely to the middle of the pond then measure sediment and water  depth at the five positions shown in the diagram below.  Transect A is the longest dimension  of the pond.  Take readings at ¼, ½ and ¾ along it.  Transect B is perpendicular to this.  Take  readings at ¼ and ¾ of the distance across transect B.  If it is not possible to take some of the  readings then put a cross through the relevant boxes.    Current water level Maximum winter water level  Drawdown height  75%  50%   25%  Maximum  water  level 57  Transect  A  Transect  B  Maximum  water level     Estimating composition of sediment and pond base  Most ponds have a layer of sediment consisting of soft or hard substances such as organic  debris, silt, sand.  This sits on top of the pond base which is usually a natural material (e.g.  gravel, clay, rock, peat) and occasionally may be man-made (e.g. puddled clay or artificial  liner). Note that puddled clay pond bases are quite rare: most ponds with clay bases are  located on naturally occurring clay geology.  Examine the sediment and pond base to work out its composition.  Wearing long sleeved  gloves take a small handful of sediment and feel the base material at various positions around  the pond, both in and out of the water.  Use the net pole to feel in deeper water to feel the  extent of soft and hard material.  Estimate the proportion of the total area of the sediment that is made up of each of the  following: (i) organic debris, leaves and twigs, (ii) ooze (non-particulate) and fine silts, (iii)  gravel / sand (often stream-borne), or others (specify what they are).  For each of these write  a 1 on the fieldsheet if that element makes up 0% to 32% of the total, 2 for 33% to 66% and 3  for 67% to 100%.  For the pond base record using the same system of categories the proportion of the pond base  area which consists of each of the following: (i) clay or silt, (ii) gravel, sand or cobbles, (iii)  rock, (iv) peat, or (v) others (specify).    Estimating the extent of pollution in the pond  Examine the pond for dumped rubbish and rubble.  If there is none or a negligible amount  (e.g. a few chewing gum wrappers, less than 1% of a small pond affected) tick the box,  otherwise estimate the area covered.  Assess visually whether there is potential for road run-off to enter the pond.  If there is then  score the likely impact on a scale from 1 (minimal input) to 5 (major input e.g. drain direct  from major road into small pond).  Take into account factors such as the proximity of the  road, whether it drains a large area of road as, for example, when the pond takes road run-off  from a hill, the probable route taken by water draining from the road and the size of the pond.    List any other physical evidence of pollution such as oil or presence of field drains.    Describing inflows and outflows  Identify any inflows into or outflows from the pond, even if they are dry at the time of  survey.  Note the number of dry inflows and outflows.  For each wet inflow and outflow  record the average water width and depth.  Measure the rate of flow in terms of the time in  seconds it takes for the water to travel one metre.  This is most easily done by stirring up the  sediment and timing how long it takes to travel a measured distance.  If you cannot tell  whether the water in the inflow or outflow is moving mark a cross in the box. 58    Recording pond management  Tick the appropriate boxes if there is any evidence of the following pond management having  been carried out.  Ignore any management which has obviously been carried out over 10 years  ago or is at such a distance that it is unlikely to impact the pond.  The options to record are as  follows:  •  the pond has been fully dredged  •  the pond has been partly dredged  •  more than 5% of the pond vegetation has been removed  •  some, but less than 5%, of the pond vegetation has been removed  •  trees have been planted  •  trees have been felled   •  trees have been partly cut back  •  the pond has been changed in its shape or size  •  plants have been introduced (e.g. obvious species that should not be in this  geographic locations, baskets etc)  •  plants on the pond bank have been mown  •  straw has been added to the pond  •  structural work has been carried out (e.g. to dam the pond).    Evidence of livestock grazing  This section refers to evidence of grazing by livestock defined as cows, sheep and horses, not  grazing by wild animals (e.g. rabbits or deer).  If there is evidence that the pond is grazed by  livestock (e.g. ground is poached) tick the box on the fieldsheet and record the percentage of  the pond perimeter that is grazed.  This will usually be all of the perimeter unless access is  restricted in some parts e.g. by fencing, trees or if an area is too steep.  If there is evidence of  grazing then estimate grazing intensity from 1 (infrequent or low intensity) to 5 (pond  margins heavily poached and almost bare).  If possible list the types of grazing livestock.    Evidence of use by water birds  This section refers to use, and over-use, by water birds such as ducks, geese, coots, moorhens  and swans.  If there is evidence that the pond is used by these birds (either the birds  themselves or signs such as trampling, feathers, faeces, food left by humans) then tick the  box on the fieldsheet.  Then estimate the intensity of their impact from 1 (little evidence of  impact) to 5 (little vegetation, “duck pond”).  Record any other information e.g. species,  evidence of nesting.    Evidence of fish  Record a 1 on the fieldsheet if fish are known to be present i.e. if you or your colleagues have  seen fish in the pond during the survey or if a someone who knows the pond has seen fish in  it this year.  Record 2 if there is evidence that fish are likely to be present (e.g. fishing pegs, 59  turbid water).  Record 3 if there is no evidence that fish are present.  If possible record any  further information such as species or estimates of abundance.    Evidence of amphibians  Tick the box if you see any amphibians.  If possible record any further information on  species, life stage and approximate number.    Recording surrounding land use  Estimate the percentage of surrounding land use or land cover in each of the following  categories in two distance zones from the perimeter of the pond: (i) 0 to 5 m, and (ii) 0 to  100m (see figure below).  This can include land outside the kilometre square.      Category  Examples  Trees & woodland  Deciduous and coniferous woodland, individual trees, scrub, hedgerow  Heathland & moorland  Dwarf shrub heath, sub-arctic mountain  Unimproved grassland  Herb-rich, calcareous, acid and moorland grassland (plant quality  indicators usually present)  Rank vegetation   Unmanaged grass, neglected & abandoned land, set-aside, verges, golf  course roughs, buffer strips  Improved grassland  Fertile agricultural grass, mown grass, golf course greens (plant quality  indicators absent)  Arable  All crops, includes flower and fruit crops (e.g. strawberries) and  ploughed land  Urban buildings & gardens Areas in curtilage, includes glass-houses, farm yards  Roads, tracks, paths  Including car-parks and footpaths  0 to 100m from  maximum winter  water level of pond  0 to 5m from  maximum winter  water level of pond 60  Rock, stone, gravel  Cliffs, rock-outcrops, gravel-pits, quarries, areas of sand, gravel or stone  Bog, fen, marsh, flush  Wetland vegetation, blanket bog  Ponds & lakes  Permanent and seasonal waterbodies  Streams & ditches  River, stream, ditch, spring  Other (state)   Where the land use does not fit into any of the above categories e.g.  maritime vegetation, saltmarsh, sand-dune, orchard, bracken, canal,  railway    Amenity value: view of pond  Are there any public rights of way near the pond from which it could be visible?  Score each  on a scale from 1 (pond totally obscured) to 5 (significant part of the pond clearly visible).   Score separately for ‘A’ roads, ‘B’ roads, minor roads, footpaths, bridle paths, or other (state  what they are).   If there is more than one of any type of right of way record the highest score.    Amenity value: public access to pond  Record whether or not the pond is in area of open public access  (e.g. Common, village  green) i.e. could a member of the public access the pond without needing permission?  A  public footpath passing alongside a pond does not count as it being in an area of open public  access.    Amenity value: evidence of amenity use  Tick the appropriate boxes if there is evidence of any of the following amenity uses:  •  Fishing (fishing platforms, pegs, swims, embayments)  •  Ornamental fish (e.g. goldfish, Koy carp)  •  Ornamental/pinioned wildfowl (nesting boxes, feeders, platforms)  •  Pond dipping and other wildlife interests (dipping platforms, bird hides)  •  Shooting (hides, blinds)  •  Boating and other water sports (boat, boathouse)  •  Golf hazard  •  Other (please state). 61  Macrophyte survey method    Overview  The aims of the macrophyte survey are to:    •  record all species of wetland plant present within the outer boundary of the pond, and  estimate their abundance.  •  estimate the total plant cover in terms of submerged, floating-leaved and emergent  species, and  •  record the amount of shade from overhanging trees and woody plants.    Carrying out the macrophyte survey  Make sure you are aware of the position of the outer boundary of the pond.  The aim is to  record all species of macrophyte within this area.    The recording sheet gives a list of all plant species to be considered as wetland plants for this  survey.  Nomenclature follows The New Atlas of the British and Irish Flora (2002).  Taxa  such as hybrids, sub-species, exotics and cultivars have been omitted to save space.  If they  are identified they should be noted in the space provided.  Terrestrial plants and wetland  plants growing outside the pond boundary should not be recorded.    Rare species (IUCN Red List status or recorded in less than 100 10 x 10 km squares in  Britain) have been marked with an asterisk.  If any of these are found confirmation is needed.  Guidance for this is given in the section “Rare species confirmation” below.    Plants should be surveyed by walking and wading all safely accessible areas within the outer  boundary of the pond.  Deeper water areas should be surveyed by regularly throwing a  grapnel to collect submerged plants.  In larger waterbodies look for plants blown from deeper  water and deposited on the strand-line.  In ponds with inorganic substrates (e.g. new ponds,  ponds with a sand or gravel base) check the very shallow areas for stoneworts and fine-leaved  pondweeds.  Stoneworts, in particular, are often under recorded. Better quality ponds often  support more than one species of stonewort so if stonewort plants are found, look around for  other plants with a different morphology or colour.    Note on the fieldsheet any areas of the pond you are unable to access to survey.    Plant identification  Most wetland plants can be identified in the field using a hand lens. All plants should be  identified to species level wherever possible, except for Populus and Salix, which can be  recorded as sp.      If you are not sure of an identification collect a sample in a sealed, labelled plastic bag  to examine later using your identification keys.  A list of identification keys for wetland  plants is given in the box below.    If you are unable to identify a species you can send a specimen for identification.  This will  be likely for many Callitriche, Potamogeton, Ranunculus and charophyte species. See table  below for guidance. 62  Recommendations for plants to routinely send off for identification  Group  Recommended routine  collection  Method Comments  Callitriche  All species but only if  fruits present.  Pressed  This group has always caused significant  confusion and even the translucent-leaved  species have sometimes been mis-recorded due  to the spread of C.truncata. Vegetative material  can only rarely be identified reliably and usually  needs to be recorded as Callitriche sp..  Potamogeton  All species except  P.natans, P.polygonifolius,  P. crispus.   Pressed  Fine-leaved species are critical and are  frequently confused. Broad-leaved species are  easier but are complicated by some frequent  hybrids.   Ranunculus  (Sect.  Batrachium)    All species if aquatic and  with flowers and fruits  except R. hederaceus,  R.omiophyllus and  R.circinatus.  Pressed  A difficult group and complicated by  hybridisation. Most species with capillary leaves  cannot be identified without flowers and fruits or  when growing terrestrially. These should be  recorded as R.aquatilis agg.  Utricularia    Routine collection of  U.minor is not necessary  while the segregates of  U.vulgaris agg. cannot be  separated vegetatively.  Pickled  Separating into the three main groups is not  difficult. In the U.vulgaris agg., U.australis and  U.vulgaris cannot satisfactorily be separated  vegetatively. Flowering material is fairly easy to  separate but the flowers are best preserved  pickled. The segregates of U.intermedia agg.  (which very rarely flower in the UK) can be  separated vegetatively from the internal hairs on  the bladders. These must be pickled, not pressed.   Stoneworts  (Charophytes)    All species  Pressed or  pickled  An important group, because a high proportion  of species are uncommon. Some species require  microscopic confirmation.   Hybrids  All hybrids of aquatic  species and uncommon  hybrids of emergent taxa.  Pressed    Other problem areas  Myriophyllum    Consider keeping samples  if the site is in an area  where the species is  uncommon (e.g the  Highlands and upland  areas for M.spicatum, most  of England for  M.alterniflorum, most  areas outside the Fens and  Norfolk Broads for  M.verticillatum).  Pressed  Some confusion has arisen between M.spicatum,  M.verticillatum and M.alterniflorum due to lack  of clarity of characters in some identification  texts, particularly in the past.     Sparganium  Consider keeping samples  of S.natans from upland or  acidic lake situations.  Pressed  Again there have been confusions, particularly in  the past, between S.angustifolium and S.natans.  This has resulted in some over-recording of the  latter.   Modified from: Stewart (2004). Recommendations for the collection and preservation of specimens during macrophyte surveys.    Rare species confirmation  Species that are (or suspected to be) rare need to be confirmed. Note that rare and legally  protected plants are indicated on the plant fieldsheet with an asterisk. 63  The process of confirming rare plants needs to be undertaken with care because (i) there  should be a general presumption against damaging plants, particulalry of uncommon species,  (ii) a licence is needed to remove Wildlife and Countryside Act Schedule 8 species.    In practice, however, pieces of plants will need to be "picked" in order to examine them out  of the water for identification. These bits can then be re-used to provide voucher specimens  for confirmation. However, care should always be taken to minimise damage to potentially  rare species, particularly where populations are small.     Where there are concerns about damage, then a digital photograph can be used for  confirmation if this is likely to be sufficient for identification  (e.g. flowering or fruiting  Baldellia growing on muddy shores). For very rare species (i.e. RDB or Scheduled species),  where there are no other appropriate means of confirmation, a message should be left, as  soon as possible, for the Pond Conservation project team (see contact details at the end of the  pond section) who will visit the site. 64    List of identification keys for wetland plants (non-exhaustive)  General  Blamey, M., Fitter, R. and Fitter, A.

Sending specimens for identification  To send a specimen for identification take a small amount of the plant (e.g. 15 cm minimum),  if possible including any features likely to help identification e.g. flowers / fruit / branched  stems / underwater and surface leaves.    Write a label in pencil on waterproof paper.  Include the square number and pond  identification number, your name and the date and make sure the information on the label is  transferred with the specimen as it is pressed or preserved.    Place the wet plant in a sealable plastic bag and press or preserve within a few hours.    To press most plants (e.g. Callitriche species): place on a piece of A4 clean white paper and  put this between two more sheets.  Put this between c.10 sheets of newspaper and store with a  weight on top e.g. under a heavy book.  Change the surrounding paper as necessary to ensure  the plant is completely dry and so does not rot. 65  To press plants with finely divided floating leaves (e.g. Ranunculus, Potamogeton species):  float the plant in clean water in a small shallow tray.  Place a piece of thin white card under  the plant and lift out of the water gently so the structure of the plant can be seen –  then treat  as described above.    When the pressed plants are dry store in the plastic wallets in the box file provided.    To preserve in alcohol (‘pickle’), (e.g. Charophytes): put a specimen of the plant into a 25ml  Sterilin tube and fill with 80% alcohol (provided for preservation of the invertebrate sample).    Return pressed and preserved plant specimens to Pond Conservation.     Filling in the fieldsheet  Record the plants found by drawing a line in pencil through their names on the fieldsheet.  Estimate abundance for each species in terms of the area of the pond it covers using the  following scale and note this next to the species name e.g. Agrostis stolonifera F.  D  Dominant  91 – 100% cover  A  Abundant  51 – 90% cover  F  Frequent  21 – 50% cover  O  Occasional  6 – 20% cover  R  Rare  0 – 5% cover    Record in the boxes provided the total percentage of the area of the pond covered by:  •  submerged plant species (species in the submerged plant list)  •  floating-leaved plant species (species in the floating-leaved plant list)  •  emergent plant species (species in the emergent plant list)  •  tree overhang (imagine looking down on the pond from above, assess the proportion  of the area of the pond that is directly overhung by woody vegetation).    Completing the survey  Checking survey data is complete  Check all relevant boxes on the fieldsheet have been filled in and that separated field sheets  (i.e. pond mapping recording sheet, environmental survey, macrophyte survey and water  quality fieldsheets) have been stapled together.  Tick the box on the fieldsheet to confirm this has been done.    Returning samples and fieldsheets for analysis  One member of each survey team will be responsible for overseeing storage of water samples,  plant specimens and fieldsheets.  When convenient (aim for at least once per month)  fieldsheets should be photocopied and posted with plant specimens to Pond Conservation.   Photos can be copied onto CD and posted with fieldsheets or emailed with square and pond  numbers so long as emails do not exceed 20Mb each.

PATCheS Field Dataset This dataset contains: Overview of field site and datasets (this document) Field topography (Terrestrial laser scanner data; .pts)  CT scans (raw and processed; .tif, metadata, .mat) Field site overview The aim of the field work was to measure the grain-scale structure of a gravel-bed river, and to assess how this structure varied through a riffle-pool sequence. The study site was Bury Green Brook, Hertfordshire (51.848485, 0.079786); which is a small, ephemeral, gravel-bed river with a riffle-pool morphology. The study site was ~100 m long, and the channel with varied between 3 and 6 m. Further information on the site can be found in Hodge et al. (2013). The fieldsite was visited on five occasions: September 2014; June 2015; July 2016; April 2017 and October 2018. Field site control network In September 2014 an arbitrary coordinate system was established around the field site, whereby 12 temporary benchmarks (2 ground permamarkers and 10 survey discs) were affixed to well established trees and fence posts. These were surveyed using a reflectorless Leica total station with the total station location being set as X=1000, Y=1000 and Z=100 m. All subsequent surveys were surveyed on the same arbitrary system by first resectioning the total station into the coordinate system before targets were surveyed (see below). Terrestrial Laser Scan (TLS data) TLS data were collected from a 75 m (along thalweg) length of the channel on all five field visits using a Leica P20 laser scanner. 8 High Definition Survey Targets were setup up through the reach these were surveyed into the pre-established arbitrary co-ordinate system using a reflectorless Leica Total Station. Scanning was undertaken from 7 locations. Resolution was set to 3.1 mm at 10 m range. For each site visit, the separate scans were registered together using the target locations (arbitrary grid) using Leica Cyclone software, to a RMSE of 0.002-0.005  m (see registration files). Data was exported as text (PTS) files, which includes the following: Row 1: Total number of points exported
Dataset Originator:  ECN Data Centre (http://data.ecn.ac.uk – ecn@ceh.ac.uk), Centre for Ecology and Hydrology Dataset Owners:  The UK Environmental Change Network (ECN) programme is sponsored by a consortium of UK government departments and agencies with an interest in understanding the causes and consequences of environmental change, who contribute to the programme through funding either site monitoring or network co-ordination activities.  These organisations are the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute, Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, Cyfoeth Naturiol Cymru - Natural Resources Wales, Defence Science & Technology Laboratory, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Environment Agency, Forestry Commission, Llywodraeth Cymru - Welsh Government, Natural England, Natural Environment Research Council, Northern Ireland Environment Agency, Scottish Environment Protection Agency, Scottish Government, Scottish Natural Heritage.   ECN requests that you acknowledge the use of our data sets. This helps us to gauge the extent of use of each dataset and allows us to demonstrate the value of these data for research into environmental change. We also request that you send us one reprint of any publication that cites the use of our data. Protocol Reference:  http://www.ecn.ac.uk/measurements/terrestrial/b/ba      Please Note: Bat species are mapped (using a bat detector) and their behaviour recorded on a transect.   The methodology is based on that used in the Bats and Habitats survey organised by Prof S. Harris and colleagues at the University of Bristol for the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.   The transect is walked four times in each year (once in each of the following three-week periods: 15 June – 6 July; 7 July – 27 July; 28 July – 17 August; 18 August – 7 September).  Surveys are not carried out when rain is heavy or there are strong winds.   The methodology is somewhat limited in the amount of information which it can provide on the precise relationships between population levels and environmental change; nevertheless by linking ECN results to those from more widespread monitoring programmes these limitations can be mitigated.    Please ensure that you use the accompanying quality information when using the data.    Data Structure The data are held in 10 tables (one for each site) in an Oracle database.  The tables are called D1BA_xxx where xxx is the site code.  The structure of the data tables are:  Information about how the survey was conducted is held in 10 tables (one for each site) in an Oracle database.  The tables are called D2BA_xxx where xxx is the site code.  The structure of the data tables are:  Information about the habitats observed on transect is held in 10 tables (one for each site) in an Oracle database.

Instructions on methods of survey and recording    1.1.  General  You will be supplied with the necessary site and plot location maps, recording sheets and soil  sampling bags and boxes before leaving Merlewood. A check list of all equipment is given in  Appendix V. CEH can lend girth tapes for DBH measurement and sighting poles for slope or tree  height measurement if necessary. In any event all survey teams should use the same methods.     Woods will be located using a list of grid references and names for each woodland site, an A4  extract from the relevant 1:50,000 OS map (plus, wherever possible, a copy of the original 2½”  map) showing the location of each site and an enlarged copy of the site sketch map showing the  locations of each of the 16 plot locations that need to be re-recorded (from either the 1:50, 000 or  2 ½” map – please check carefully as this will affect locating plots). Having located the site the  first important thing is obtaining PERMISSION to enter and survey the site in question.    1.2.  Access and Permission to Survey Sites  It will be the responsibility of the surveyors to obtain permission to survey the woods. The  contractors will provide such information as they hold but for some woods there will be no  known owner and this will need to be established on the ground. Once you have established  ownership, record names and addresses with the survey results on the back of the Site  Description sheet. You MUST obtain permission to access the land.    Experience from Pilot Woodland Re-survey and the Countryside Survey 2000 fieldwork showed  that, in the majority of cases, land-owners could be identified and permissions secured in half a  day –even with multiple owners. There were very few cases where land-owners refused  permission to survey their land. Most are fascinated by the fact that records existed from 1971  and that these records could be accurately updated.     In order to ease negotiations you will be provided with a letter of introduction explaining the  background to the survey. You can also assure any landowner that they will receive a complete  copy of the results (1971 and 2002) for their parcel of land. This is also why it is crucial to note  down addresses and contact numbers for each site.    1.3.  Location of the Sampling Points  A map will be provided that is marked with the 16 random sampling points (numbered 1-16).  Locating these points on the ground is an extremely critical part of the survey procedure upon  which much else depends. There are two important factors in locating the points:    i) Accuracy  ii) Absence of subjective bias (i.e. not exercising choice)    In practice, high accuracy is not possible without resorting to time-consuming methods.  However a reasonable degree of accuracy is required if plot and map derived datasets are to be  compatible, since certain information about the plots (altitude, slope position, measures of  exposure etc.) will be taken from the map. Three maps will be provided: (i) 1:50 for location, (ii)  a photocopy of the original 2½” with plot locations and (ii) expanded version of the same.    PLEASE NOTE that the contours on the 2½” map are in 25 foot intervals and the original 1971  instructions to surveyors were that 1/32nd of an inch = 22 yards. If you have a metric map, or  wish to work in metres, you will have to convert all distances and slopes accordingly. 4 There are no permanent markers for each plot as absolute reference points to determine the  accuracy of relocation. A degree of re-location error is expected given the lack of permanent  markers but our experience in the pilot survey shows that the following re-location procedure  performs substantially better than analysis of repeat records from a newly randomised set of  locations.     More important is the avoidance of bias. Such considerations as, “this bit is not very typical”, or,  “we had a bit like this last time, we will walk on another 10 paces, it looks better there”, must be  avoided at all costs. Taking short or long paces in order to avoid a blackthorn thicket or nettle  bed is an equally serious crime as is the location of plots in situations judged to be in any sense  ‘homogenous’.    PLEASE NOTE THAT THE USE OF GPS TO LOCATE PLOTS IS DISCOURAGED. THIS  MAY BRING YOU CLOSER TO THE 1971 MAPPED PLOT LOCATION BUT MAY NOT  NECESSARILY BRING YOU CLOSER TO WHERE THE PLOT WAS ACTUALLY  RECORDED. BECAUSE GPS WAS NOT USED IN 1971 ITS USE IN 2003 COULD  INTRODUCE BIAS.     1.4.  Relocation approach:  The approach will be to pace out along a compass bearing having derived a distance and angle  from the plot location map.     Each enlarged map has one complete side of a 1 km square marked on it. This will allow you to  scale between distance on the map and distance on the ground e.g. 1 mm = 10 m on a 1:10,000  map. Please note, plot location maps have been enlarged to different extents to increase the  clarity of the plot locations so you will need to work out a map-to-ground correspondence  separately for each plot location map.     Bear in mind that the sites may have altered significantly over 30 years. Collect soil samples and  record the vegetation even if the plot is no longer woodland. Only do not record if it is built- over. We know that at least one site has been bisected by a motorway since 1971. Dramatic  changes in land-use may have affected other sites as well. Do not attempt to record plots that  now fall into land you have no permission to survey but DO make a note of the change in use. In  particular, do not record plots on used railway embankments or motorway verges. Be sensible  and stay alive!     1.5.  Order of Recording the Data  One site description and habitat form must be completed for each site and three sets of data (each  with its own recording form) and one soil sample must be collected from each plot.     We recommend you use clutch pencils to fill in all recording forms. They do not need sharpening  and since all forms will be printed onto waterproof paper, pencil will be preferable to pen if it is  raining. An example of each recoding form is given in Appendix IV. The vegetation plot for  ground flora should be recorded first so that it is surveyed in a relatively undisturbed state. The  remaining recording can then be carried out in the most manageable order.    Recording Forms for each dataset  (a)  Vegetation plot. Ground Flora - presence and absence in five successively increasing  quadrat sizes up to the full 14.14 x 14.14 m, with % cover/abundance estimates for the  largest of these. Major common bryophytes should be recorded but a full list is not  expected (see below).  (b)  Site description and habitats - mostly presence and absence of attributes. 5 (c)  Trees, saplings and shrubs - trees, DBH (cm) and species from all four quarters of a  14.14 x 14.14 m plot (200 m2), the same data for saplings and shrubs from a pair of  diagonally opposite quarters 1 and 3 of the plot.  (d)  Plot description and habitat data - mostly presence and absence of attributes, from the  same 14.14 x 14.14 m plot.    Samples   (i) A soil sample dug from each plot to be obtained at the same time as the plot survey.     The methods of setting out the plots and the collecting and recording of the data are now dealt  with in detail.      2.  Recording of Plot Data    There are four recording forms for the following categories. The Appendix provides further  details on individual categories and classifications.    2.1.  Vegetation plot: Ground Flora  The first operation when the plot centre has been located, is to lay out the plot. The four corner  posts delineate the largest 14.14 x 14.14 m (200 m2) plot. The plot should be located so that the  diagonal strings, and hence corners of the plot, are orientated along cardinal compass points.  Spaced along each of the distance strings are four coloured markers that give the half-diagonal  distances of the four smaller plots (see Figure 2). Starting with the smallest 2 x 2 m plot, the area  within is carefully searched recording the presence of all ground flora species - all vascular  plants (monocots, dicots, and ferns) - including tree or shrub seedlings <25 cm in height. A  record of the presence of species in this innermost quadrat are made by inserting a 1 in the  column headed Q on the vegetation plot recording sheet and in the row corresponding to the  species concerned (see Appendix II). If the species is not listed then pencil in the entry in the  blank rows under ‘Other species’ at the bottom of the sheet. Plants which cannot be immediately  identified, or for which a subsequent check, in flora or herbarium, is required, should be placed  in a labelled paper bag.    Having recorded all species in a given quadrat size, the new area enclosed by the next successive  set of markers is searched for additional species only. This procedure is repeated until the full  14.14 x 14.14 m (200 m2) has been recorded. The most convenient method of search for the  successive sizes of quadrat is for the two operators to spiral outwards moving in opposite  directions so that both cover the whole area. Record successive quadrats by inserting the quadrat  number (2 to 5) in the Q column; as for quadrat 1.    Because of identification difficulties, only the common major bryophytes growing on the soil  should be recorded (not on tree bases, logs, rocks or other specialised habitats). A list of these  is given in Appendix I.    Having completed the record of presence of the vascular plants in all five quadrat sizes, an  estimate of cover abundance for the full plot (14.14 x 14.14 m) should be made and inserted next  to each species in any one of the two columns headed % (see Appendix II). This should include  all vascular plants plus tree/shrub seedlings recorded as present, plus the six additional categories  (litter, wood, rock, bare ground, water and bryophytes). Estimates should be given to the  nearest 5% only. Species present in appreciable quantity (either in area occupied or  number of individuals, if widely scattered), but with less than 5% cover, should be  recorded as 1. Those present as only single or few specimens with little cover should be 6 recorded as +. The total cover should add up to ca. 100% (making due allowance for the +’s and  1's), or more if the ground flora is markedly layered. Note that tree and shrub canopy cover is  not included as the canopy composition and age-class distribution is recorded instead.      2.2.  Trees, saplings and shrubs  These are recorded in the 14.14 x 14.14 m plot, the laying out of which has already been  described in (a) above. Decisions as to whether individuals are in the plot, or not, are based on  rooted base being 50% or more within the plot.    (i) Trees are defined as stems of >5 cm DBH of any species which is normally capable of  attaining a tree like habit. Exceptions include Hazel, Blackthorn, Viburnum spp.,  Juniper and other shrubs, which rarely produce stems >5 cm diameter anyway. The            Distance string position from centre - 1/2 diagonal   Q1  = 4 m2 quadrat (2 m x 2 m) = 1.42 m diagonal  Q2 = 25 m2 (5.00 x 5.00 m) = 3.54 m   Q3 = 50 m2 (7.07 x 7.07 m) = 5.00 m   Q4 = 100 m2 (10.00 x 10.00 m) = 7.07 m   Q5 = 200 m2 (14.14 x 14.14 m) = 10.00 m   Not to scale  Figure 2  LAYOUT OF VEGETATION PLOT  Quarter No 1 (NE)  Quarter No 4  (NW)  Quarter 3 (SW)  1.42m  Q2  Q3  Q4  Q5  Marker   tags  Corner   post  Quarter No 2  (SE)  Centre post and   right angle   gauge  Q1  7.07 m  5.00 m  3.54 m 7 species and DBH (cm) of all stems in the whole plot over 5 cm diameter is measured  (recording by quarters of the plot). Trees with multiple stems have each stem measured  and recorded separately but these are bracketed together on the recording sheet (see  Appendix III). Dead trees (standing of course) or dead stems on multi-stemmed trees,  are designated by a capital “D” in the top right-hand corner of the cell in which its  diameter is recorded.  (ii) Saplings - tree species, with the same definition as (i), but with a height >130 cm (ie over  breast height) but <5 cm DBH are recorded only in the diagonally opposite quarters 1 and  3. Quarter 1 is always the NE quadrant. Quarter 3 is always the SW quadrant (see  Figure 2). The same measurements as for trees, species and DBH (cm), are recorded for  these with the same conventions for multi-stemmed and dead trees or stems.  (iii)  Shrubs - as defined above according to species. Like the saplings these are only  recorded in the diagonally opposite quarters 1 and 3; same data, same conventions.    The final job is to measure the height of the largest tree in the plot (the tree with the largest DBH  - regardless of species). It is recommended that you use an Abney hand level, clinometer or  hygrometer. If provided with a hygrometer – please use this in preference. Failing this you  MUST calibrate your preferred method against the hygrometer and detail the calibration in the  record sheets. Whichever method is used always ensure that your horizontal distance is taken  along the same contour: the slope should be zero between the observer and the base of tree.  If this proves impossible then you must record the ground slope so that a correction can be  made later. In the eventuality of the largest tree being in some way atypical (i.e. top broken off)  the next largest should be substituted. An example of a completed recording form is given in  Appendix III.    (1) Height Measurement with a clinometer   Insert the horizontal distance and angle to the top of the tree next to the relevant individual on  the DBH data sheet (see Appendix III). Note you will have to insert the horizontal distance  between observer and tree plus the angle to treetop. The actual height will then be  calculated in the spreadsheets you will use for data entry after the survey.        (2) Height Measurement with a hypsometer  If these are available then instructions will be provided following training on the field course  Use a clinometer to measure the angle between ground and tree top to give Xo.     Xo Horizontal distance on level ground (H) Tree height = (Tan (Xo) x H) + height from ground to eye level 8 2.3.  Plot description and habitats  These are recorded on the basis of presence within the 14.14 x 14.14 m plot by striking out the  appropriate attributes on the form. The object of this form is to obtain frequency data about  important attributes that can reasonably be expected to occur a measurable number of times  within a single site. A detailed account of methods and definitions of the attributes is given in  Appendix IV (the second number in brackets referring to the plot form attributes). In the case of  attributes that have an appreciable defined area, e.g. ponds, glades, etc., only part of the  full area needs to be in the plot for it to be recorded as present. For example if only part of a  glade 50 m across occurred actually within the plot it would be recorded as present and attribute  76 struck off. The comments column can be used to record any information that is not included  elsewhere and is considered relevant or useful in interpretation.    2.4.  Soil sampling  The objective is to obtain a composite soil sample from each plot. Soil samples are to be taken  from the centre of each plot or as near as possible (not more than 1 m distant).     Each sample bag must have a self-adhesive label stuck on indicating site and plot (labels  provided – ideally done when the bag is dry before starting fieldwork). Wherever possible, bags  should also be marked using a permanent marker in the field after the soil sample has been  collected – on the bag itself, showing site and plot. Unknown soil samples results in the loss of  data – hence double labeling to reduce such error.     Soil samples are to be taken from the top 15 cm of the soil using a trowel. Before taking the  sample, check for fresh plant litter (green) on the surface of the soil. Carefully remove this to  expose the layer of decomposing plant material below. If in doubt – include in the sample for  later removal at CEH. If the area is rocky – remove the largest rocks to expose the soil surface. If  there is more rock that soil – move to another area (within 1 m distance).    If difficulties in obtaining sufficient sample are encountered, then supplement from nearest  possible point in the plot, (again within 1 m distance) – but ensuring to sample the top 15 cm of  soil again. Should this occur, a note to this effect should be appended to the data form. The hole  should be filled in and roughly disguised before leaving the plot - this is important.     Record any problems/changes in soil sampling on the plot form.    The sample should be a representative sample of the entire 0 to 15 cm of soil and fill ca. ¾ of the  bag, wherever possible. Bags are all self-sealing, so when filled, seal to keep air-tight and  prevent loss of soil.     All soil sample bags should be kept in the plastic boxes corresponding to each site (marked using  the self-adhesive labels) and stored in a cool place until returned to CEH Merlewood. 9 2.5.  Completion of the Plot  Having filled in all data recording forms and collected all necessary samples, the recording of the  plots is now complete. At this point it is advisable to:    (i)  check that all forms have been fully entered – make a quick check to see that  major items have not been omitted, and that the site, plot number and date of  survey have been correctly entered at the top of each form.    (ii)  Check all the samples into your rucksack.    (iii)  Check all the equipment into your rucksack.      (iv)  Check the soil sampling area has been filled in.    (v)  Take one last quick look round the plot to see that nothing important has been  omitted and no equipment left behind.    The data you are collecting is being collected “forever”. Make sure that it is comprehensive and  correct to the best of your ability even at the expense of taking a little extra time.    One additional set of data has to be collected for the site as a whole (i.e. comprising the plots and  the ground in-between), namely site description and habitats for the whole site - separate but  similar form to that for the plot.      3.  Site Description and Habitats    3.1  Recording forms  A detailed description of how this data should be collected and recorded on the form and  definitions for all attributes is given in Appendix IV (attribute numbers not in brackets).  Coverage is of the whole site, both within and between plots. In order to record section L  (Marginal Land Use) and M (Boundary Type) it will almost certainly be necessary to walk round  all or part of the boundary. Useful information can also be obtained from the site map. Please  make full use of comments section to note any features may help in the interpretation of change.  Also make sure you record any information gleaned from conversation with the land-owner,  although such anecdotal information will not be consistently recorded it can help when  interpreting change. Since surveyors are required to draft brief pen sketches of each site, it will  be in your interest to complete the plot and site descriptor sheets in the field.     3.1  Completion of the Site  When the whole site has been completed (4 sets of data and 2 sets of samples for 16 plots, plus  the site description sheet) all the sheets should be stapled together in plots, checked for  completeness and put back into the cardboard site folder ready for data entry. 10  4.  Soil dispatch to Merlewood    When all 16 soil samples from each plot are in the plastic box, you are now ready to dispatch to  CEH Merlewood. An address label is supplied to be taped to each box when ready for dispatch.   Options for returning samples are: delivery by hand if you are in the area; courier; recorded  delivery next day post; collection by CEH (when this is local or near a CEH station). Options for  sample return will be finalised in discussion with surveyors at the field course. Each survey team  should, ideally ensure that samples are sent so that they arrive at CEH Merlewood within the  week they are sampled. Please remember that CEH Merlewood is closed over the weekend so  courier/post will not be delivered to CEH Merlewood on a Saturday or Sunday. It is much better  to keep the samples until the following week in a cool place than send them on a Friday when  they could end up sitting somewhere hot for two days. 11  APPPENDIX    Appendix Ia - List of top 25 most common bryophytes recorded from Pilot woodland sites    BRC code  BRC names  CountOfBryoCode  8201214  Polytrichum sp.  254  820599  Thuidium tamariscinum  173  820507  Pseudoscleropodium purum  152  8101308  Lophocolea sp.  132  8201147  Fissidens sp.  123  820395  Plagiomnium undulatum  111  820382  Mnium hornum  109  820351  Hypnum cupressiforme sens.lat.  105  820463  Pleurozium schreberi  97  820206  Dicranum scoparium  80  820346  Hylocomium splendens  64  820532  Rhytidiadelphus loreus  64  820533  Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus  62  820534  Rhytidiadelphus triquetrus  52  8201243  Sphagnum sp.  38  820203  Dicranum majus  32  8201110  Campylopus sp.  32  820592  Thamnobryum alopecurum  26  820374  Leucobryum glaucum  25  8204  Calliergon cuspidatum  17  810867  Pellia epiphylla  16  820402  Neckera crispa  12  810827  Marchantia polymorpha  9  820335  Hookeria lucens  8  82042  Aulacomnium palustre  8 12    Appendix Ib - List of common bryophytes in Great Britain    BRC code  BRC names  82040  Atrichum undulatum  82042  Aulacomnium palustre  82081  Brachythecium rutabulum  8201106  Bryum spp.  8204  Calliergon cuspidatum  8201110  Campylopus spp.  810714  Cephalozia bicuspidate  820157  Cirriphyllum piliferum  820184  Dicranella heteromalla  820203  Dicranum majus  820206  Dicranum scoparium  820249  Eurhynchium praelongum  820255  Eurhynchium striatum  8201147  Fissidens spp.  820335  Hookeria lucens  820346  Hylocomium splendens  820351  Hypnum cupressiforme sens.lat.  820357  Isopterygium elegans  820363  Isothecium myurum  810807  Lepidozia reptans  820374  Leucobryum glaucum  810814  Lophocolea heterophylla  8101308  Lophocolea spp.  810827  Marchantia polymorpha  820382  Mnium hornum  820402  Neckera crispa  810867  Pellia epiphylla  200001105  Plagiochila spp.  820383  Plagiomnium rostratum  820395  Plagiomnium undulatum  820463  Pleurozium schreberi  820475  Pohlia nutans  8201214  Polytrichum spp.  820507  Pseudoscleropodium purum  820389  Rhizomnium punctatum  820245  Rhynchostegium confertum  820532  Rhytidiadelphus loreus  820533  Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus  820534  Rhytidiadelphus triquetrus  8201243  Sphagnum spp.  820589  Tetraphis pellucida  820592  Thamnobryum alopecurum  820599  Thuidium tamariscinum  8201052  Ulota crispa sens.lat.  820158  Climacium dendroides  8201121  Cratoneuron spp.  8201138  Drepanocladus spp.  820276  Fontinalis antipyretica  820512  Ptillium crista-castrensis 13  Appendix II VEGETATION PLOT (WOODLANDS RE-SURVEY 2000)    Site No.    Plot No.    Recorder    Date 14    Appendix III TREE, SAPLING AND SHRUB DATA    Site No. 200    Plot No. 1    Recorder: MWS    Date  24/06/71    Q  No  Species                          Ht  (m)  1      T  Oak  37  34    16  R      E  Birch  9  7  12    E      S      S  Birch  2  5  2  2    A      P      S      S  Hazel  2  5  4  3  1  1  2  4  2  1    H      R      B      2      T  Oak  16D  24    R      E      E      S      3      T  Oak  15  16D  15    R      E      E      S      S  Birch  4  1    A  Rowan 4  3  4    P      S      S  Hazel  2  5  2  1  1  2  3  2 D  3 D  1  1  3 D  H      R      B      4      T  Oak  34    R      E      E      S 15  Appendix IV    INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE PLOT AND SITE DESCRIPTION  AND HABITAT FORMS    General  One copy of the Site Description and Habitat Form is completed for each site. The Plot  Description and Habitat Form is a somewhat reduced version of the Site Form and one  is completed for each plot (i.e. 16 per site). For simplicity in the subsequent handling of  the data, the code numbers for the attributes are different on the two forms, the  attributes being numbered sequentially on each form without gaps, except for  unallocated codes. Since the methods of recording and definitions of attributes remain  the same on the two forms it is possible to treat them together by giving both code  number series - site code first unbracketed, and plot code second in brackets ( ).    Checking that all the appropriate attributes for a given plot have been recorded is part  of the routine procedure dealt with in the main text. A further check should, however,  be made that there are no logical inconsistencies between the plot and site forms;  attributes which are present on the plot form must be present on the site form (but not  necessarily vice versa). If any significant area of the site has not been covered in  connection with locating or recording the plots (or for other purposes) it should be  briefly visited to check that no attributes have been missed. Particular care should be  taken with the site form as the recording of a given attribute is an all or nothing  proposition and is therefore critical.    The attribute code numbers are dealt with in order below:    (SE = self-explanatory; and UA = unallocated).    1   (1)  Site Number - SE  2  (2)  Plot number - SE, on site form fill in as 1 -16  3  (3)  Recorder - recorder's initials  4  (4)  Date - day, month, year. Inclusive dates on site form.  (5)  Slope - (plot only) in _ or %. Depends on the instrument provided -  Blume Leiss = _, Haga = %. (See main text for methods).  (6)  Aspect - _ magnetic, SE (See main text for methods).  A.  Trees - Management  5    Planted hardwoods - must be clear evidence that the trees have been  planted, eg visible lines, uniform age and/or, in the case of mixtures,  regular alternation of species. Gets more difficult to detect planted origin  with age.  6    Planted conifers - these can usually be assumed to be planted except in  the case of European larch and Scots pine, unless there is strong  evidence to the contrary, eg irregular distribution and age. May be  natural regeneration of some species.  7    Pollards - trees that have had their main branch systems cut off at some  time at a height above breast height (4'3" or 130 cm) but have now  resprouted. An ancient method of marking boundaries or obtaining  firewood and/or browse for stock.  8 (7)    Coppice stools - trees that have been cut off below breast height and  have resprouted. Most multi-stemmed trees are the result of coppicing  but not all. Usually the point of cutting can be seen and there are usually 16  >2 stems. Hazel stools should not be recorded as coppice stools unless  there are unmistakable cut stems to be seen; a multi-stemmed growth  form is normal for this species. Many woods all over Britain, but  particularly in the south, were formerly managed on a coppicing system.  Most coppice origin woods have not been cut for 20, 50 or even more  years and have grown on so that their former use is less evident (but see  attribute 10 (9)).  9 (8)    Singled coppice - where, in what was formerly coppice, with a  preponderance of multi-stemmed trees, selected stools have had the  number of shoots reduced to one by cutting the others off. This can be  detected by the swollen base of the tree with scars where the other main  shoots were removed or by the presence of residual twiggy growth.  Becomes less detectable with time.  10 (9)   Recently cut coppice - where there is evidence that coppicing is still, or  has been until very recently, in progress. Recent coppice can be detected  from cut shoot stubs on the stools and/or the presence of coppice  produce (see also 20) in the wood. Recent - <c 5 years.  11    Mature conifers - trees >40 years old or >20 m height.  12 (10)   Stumps hardwood new - hardwood stumps can usually be distinguished  from conifers by the presence of ring-porous wood and/or medullary  rays. Often the remnants of bark can be used to identify the hardwood  species, eg oak, ash, birch. New stumps can be distinguished from old  13 (11) by the absence of advance rot, luxuriant growths or bryophytes  and by the fact that the ring growth is still discernible without cutting or  scraping the stump.  13 (11)   Stumps hardwood old - the inverse of the characters used to identify new  stumps in 12 (10) above. Stumps of species like birch rot away  completely in a very short time, whilst those of more resistant species  like oak persist for many (>50) years, so the old/new scale is necessarily  arbitrary.  14 (12)   Stumps conifer new - conifer stumps can be distinguished from  hardwoods by the absence of ring-porous wood or medullary rays.  Identifiable bark is often useful, as also is resin exudation, and the smell  of resin if reasonably fresh. Apart from Sequoias (not very likely) NO  conifers produce any coppice shoots from stumps cut near the ground.  So if there are any signs of coppice shoots live or dead it is sure to be  hardwood. the same rules for new/old hardwood stumps also apply to  conifers. Yew coppices quite frequently but is easy to identify.  15 (13)   Stumps conifer old - fully explained above, SE.  16    Stumps overgrown - in the more open woodlands, the older stumps in an  advance state of decay will often be completely overgrown by such  species as bramble, honeysuckle or bryophytes.  17    Brashing/pruning - where the lower branches of the trees have been  artificially removed by cutting to improve access and/or timber quality.  18    Brash heaps - can result from brashing or pruning, or from the cutting of  scrub species, or as the lop and top (the thinner branches) of felled trees.  Essentially, therefore, a heap of thin branches which have been left to  rot.  19    Cord wood - odds and ends of felled trees, almost invariably hardwood,  which have been cut to log size (as for putting on the fire) and have been  piled into regular stacks (usually about 4'-6' high and 2'-3' wide and any  length). 17  20    Coppice sticks - the product from cutting coppice which has been tidily  stacked for subsequent use. Can vary from large sizes such as hop poles  down to pea sticks.  21    Stack timber - the larger parts of the stems of felled trees which have  been cut into regular lengths (3' up to 30' or 40') and stacked. Anything  from pulp bolts up to the largest sizes in saw timber.  22    Felled trees - trees that have been felled but have not been processed any  further than having had the branches cut off.  23    Chips/sawdust - SE  24    Fire sites - SE, often used to get rid of brash 18.  25    Paint/blaze marks - used to mark trees for some special purpose; often  for felling, retaining or thinning out the surrounding trees in favour of  the best trees. Paint marks may consist of dots, rings or even numbers.  Blaze marks consist of the bark being cut off in a strip at about breast  height. The latter almost invariably means the tree is marked for felling.   Also include scribe marks.  26    Extraction routes - places where logs have obviously been dragged or  strips of trees removed for the same purpose.  27    Vehicle tracks - the use of vehicles on unmade ground off the main  roads or tracks (see also attributes 114-118 (79-82)).  28 (14)   UA    B.  Trees - Regeneration    29-48 (15-34) (as per species listed) - regeneration is any tree species >25cm height  and <5cm DBH and must be of seedling origin. The only exception (ie non- tree) is hazel which must of course be >25 cm in height but must also be of  obvious, recent, seedling origin (do not record coppice shoots - upper limit of 5  cm hardly applies here). Coppice shoots are not to be recorded as regeneration  and care should be taken to check this point as far as possible. Younger  seedlings, <25 cm height, will be recorded by plots as a part of the ground flora.  Regeneration over breast height will similarly be recorded in more detail with  the saplings.    C.  Trees - Dead (= Habitats)  49     Live/Dead - trees which, although still alive, have substantial dead  parts on them, >50%.  50     Standing dead <10 cm diameter - SE.  51     Standing dead >10 cm diameter - SE.  52 (35)    Fallen broken - trees dead, or recently alive, which have fallen and  are lying on or near the ground due to the main trunk breaking.  Includes trees that have been felled and abandoned. Must be <10 cm  diameter at widest point - does not include very small trees.  53 (36)    Fallen uprooted - as for 52 but uprooted with a mass of soil and roots  pulled out of the ground leaving a hole. Must be >10 cm diameter  again.  54 (37)    Log very rotten - a very old version of 52 (35) or 53 (36), the sort you  can kick into with your boot (with no broken toes). Must be >10 cm  diameter again.  55 (38)    Fallen branch >10 cm diameter - SE.  56 (39)    Hollow trees - as indicated by large holes in base or higher up, SE. 18  57 (40)    Rot hole - smaller holes <25 cm diameter where branches have fallen  off or the tree has been damaged in some way. In general not large or  deep enough to indicate the tree is hollow.  58 (41)    Stump <10 cm diameter - hardwood or conifer of any age and state of  decay.  59 (42)    Stump >10 cm diameter - as for 58 (41) apart from size.  60     UA.    D. Trees - Epiphytes and Lianes    61 (43)    Bryophytes base - <50 cm height SE.  62 (44)    Bryophytes trunk - >50 cm height, trunk referring to primary  structural members(s) of tree.  63 (45)    Bryophytes branch - no height or diameter limitations, branch  referring to secondary (and lesser) structural members of tree.  64 (46)    Lichen trunk - as 62 (44) above. Refers to foliose lichens only (not  the less conspicuous granular types). SE.  65 (47)    Lichen branch - as 63 (45) above. SE.  66 (48)    Fern - ferns growing anywhere on the tree.  67     Mistletoe - SE  68     Clematis - must ascend at least into the lower crown of trees to be  counted.  69     Ivy - as for 68 SE.  71     Macrofungi - growing anywhere on tree from base to crown. Includes  both mushroom and bracket-shaped types.  72     UA.    E. Habitats - Rock    73 (51)    Stones <5 cm - as with all attributes in this group, must be on the  surface of the ground, otherwise SE.  74 (52)    Rocks 5-50 cm - SE.  75 (53)    Boulders >50 cm - SE.  76 (54)    Scree - the essential characteristics of a scree is its actual or potential  mobility, thus distinguishing it from a rock pile (attribute 82 (62)). In  order to exhibit this mobility a scree consists of a mass of rock  fragments resting at or near the maximum angle or repose. The  instability of a scree is conferred either by additions from above or  active erosion at the base (possibly at high altitudes by the severe  climatic regime). The minimum size for recording screes is 25 m2.  Man-made screes produced by various earth-moving operations also  count (see also 133 (87) and 134 (88)).  77 (55)    Rock outcrop <5 m (height) - should be, as far as it is possible to tell,  part of the solid geology. Height refers to vertical height (includes  low angle outcrops such as limestone pavement).  78 (56)    Cliff >5 m - a larger version of 77 (55).  79 (57)    Rock ledges - horizontal surfaces of any size on rock outcrops or  cliffs (77 (55) and 78 (56)). No width limits apply.

Horses ridden  through the wood should not be recorded. Droppings, hoof marks (may  be unshod).  164 (110)   Pig - droppings, hoof marks, digging, noises. 22  165    Goat - no suggestions (not very likely anyway).  166 (111)   Red deer - droppings, fraying >1 m, hoof marks, scrapes.  167 (112)   Other deer - droppings, fraying <1 m, hoof marks, scrapes.  168 (113)   Rabbit - droppings (usually concentrated on small hummocks), holes  and incipient holes, fur.  169    Hare - not easy, apart from sight, larger than rabbit, black tips to ears,  runs differently.  170 (114)    Badger - setts (large holes with remains of bedding materials outside,  no smell), footprints, hairs on fence, latrines (groups of holes with  dropping in them), feeding excavations and scrapings.  172 (116)   Mole - mole hills.  173     Red squirrel - apart from dreys, not really distinguishable from those  of grey squirrel, must rely on sight.  174    Grey squirrel - as for 173, SE.  (117)     Squirrel (plot only) - red or grey together, SE.  175 (118)   Anthill - refers to larger species, with hill >25 cm.  176 (119)   Corpse/bones - SE but can also be used to detect the presence of the  deceased, e.g. Rabbit bones record rabbit, etc.  (120)     Spent cartridges - SE.                K.

Marginal Land Use (<400 m distant)    For some of these, e.g. Road, railway, river, etc. it will be possible to obtain correct  records from the map. The map can also be used to pinpoint parts of the marginal land  for which it will be necessary to check the use on the ground. It will be necessary to  walk much of the boundary anyway to fill in section M. A good deal of navigation to  determine the plot positions can make use of the boundary, thus economising in  walking time.    201    Woodland hardwood - >75& hardwood < 25% conifers.  202    Woodland mixed - hardwood 25 -75%, conifer 25-75%.  203    Woodland conifer - >75% conifer <25% hardwood.  204    Scrub-woody species overall height <5m.

M.  Boundary Type    221-236 All fairly self-explanatory. Must be at least 10 m in length in one piece of  any type for it to be recorded. Attributes 234 and 235, hedge thin and thick,  distinguished as <2 m and >2 m respectively. Note distinction between 228  bank and 229 ditch separately and 230 bank and ditch together. A bank must  be >1 m high. Merging direct – no obvious boundary; grading into open area  between woods and adjacent area.    N. Subjective Overall Impression of Site    236-241    Quite straightforward, simply one’s subjective impression of the site.  242    Approximately time taken to survey - SE.    Comments    Anything (but anything) that was noted about any aspect of the site and which was not  formally recorded on the form may be included here. Obviously it will not be possible  to use this information in a formal, analytical sense, but it may constitute an extremely  valuable aid to interpretation or in designing the collection of information for future  surveys. 24    Appendix IV (continued)     PLOT DESCRIPTION AND HABITATS    1 Site No. 200    2 Plot No. 1    3 Recorder MWS   4 Date 24/06/71  5 Slope 12 or %     6 Aspect 120 Mag.    __________________________________________________________________________________  A  TREES - MANAGEMENT   7 Cop.

To understand exactly how the present Countryside Survey sampling framework has been derived, it is  important to review the concepts and activities that have evolved over the last 30 years since the first survey  was carried out.  It is possible that if the earlier time-series data were not so valuable as a basis for detecting  change, and a fresh start could be made today, then a different sampling strategy might be well be adopted.   However, the present Countryside Survey methodology is inextricably linked with its predecessors and an  understanding of these is essential.    Early development of the ITE Land Classification  The beginning  In the early 1970s, the idea of widespread ecological survey of areas as big as Great Britain was barely  conceivable.  However the concept of ecological sampling at a smaller scale (e.g. individual woodlands), was  commonly accepted and it was Bunce and Shaw13 who developed local regional survey into a national  ecological sampling system.  The important part of the approach was that the sampled areas should be  representative of the whole region and, to ensure this, they employed a stratification system.  The importance of a stratified system  In order to avoid bias in the selection of samples (thereby potentially invalidating the results), any sample  should be based on objective (e.g. random) selection procedures.  However, purely random sampling  programmes run the risk of selecting, by chance, a number of samples which are at one extreme in a range of  variability and therefore not ‘typical’ of the whole population being sampled.  An extreme example would be  where a national opinion poll, by chance, only included teenagers in the sample - their voting intentions may  not be representative of the voting population at large.    To minimise this risk, stratification systems are used to ‘carve up’ the population into discreet layers, or strata,  so that all parts of the population are sampled.  In the analogy above, most national opinion polls sample  within different age strata.  In ecological terms, it is likely that different species and ecological processes occur  in different types of land.  A simple stratification might then divide the land surface into different altitude ranges  so that uplands and lowlands, which tend to have different ecological characteristics, are adequately sampled.  However, this represents a very simple stratification and, just as opinion polls attempt to sample not just  different age strata but also those concerned with gender, social, racial and regional backgrounds, so other  factors are important in ecological survey.  Land at a certain altitude in north-east Scotland may have different 3 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007)  The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey   ecological affinities to land at the same altitude in East Anglia.  Thus other, secondary strata may need to be  introduced.  If this argument is extended to its logical conclusion, then it can be seen that many different strata  may need to be created by combining a number of different determining factors.  This is the theoretical basis  of the ITE Land Classification.    Development of the first version of the ITE Land Classification system.  In the early 1970s, Bunce and Shaw carried out a sample survey of the Lake District National Park.  They had  spent several years surveying and classifying vegetation in woodlands13 and elsewhere; this depended on  recording plant species in square plots (quadrats) and then classifying the quadrats into groups (vegetation  types) depending on which species were present.  Thus, all the quadrats in one group tended to have more or  less similar species present while those in another group had different species.  They used a multivariate  classification system called Indicator Species Analysis (ISA)35 to group the quadrats.  Bunce and Shaw  realised that the same approach could be ‘scaled up’ to classify areas of land, except that the quadrats would  be larger (eg a 1 km square) and, instead of using species as the basis of classifying, they would use  environmental attributes (such as altitude, geology and climate).  The work was pioneered in the Lake District  National Park and then extended and tested in Cumbria14, Lancashire and other regions of GB.  In 1975, the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology (ITE), capitalising on the potential of the approach, provided  funding for a national ecological survey of GB.  The survey had two major prerequisites:  •  it should be carried out using field survey (in order to obtain the level of ecological information required),   •  it should be carried out within a single field season.  As a result of the earlier work in Cumbria and elsewhere, it was thought that the sample unit of a 1km square  was appropriate, being small enough to survey in a reasonable period of time and yet large enough to contain  sufficient environmental features to allow differentiation of squares.  With over 240,000 1km squares in GB, a  sampling approach was an obvious necessity and a stratified, random sampling system was then developed –  the ITE Land Classification was born.  In the mid-1970s, when this work was being done, computing power was such that software packages like ISA  could only operate on a limited number of datasets.  Thus it was not possible to create a classification of all 1  km squares in GB and an alternative strategy had to be found.  By taking the centre square of a 15 x 15 km  grid across GB, a suitable number of squares was identified for classification (1228).  Environmental,  physiographic and other mapped data were then collected for each of the 1228 squares and the dataset was  analysed using ISA to produce 32 classes (Table 1).  Four squares surrounding each of the classified squares  were also allocated to classes using the key provided by ISA; thus a total of 6040 squares were classified  (Figure 1).  Full details of this procedure can be found in Bunce et al6 and Bunce et al7.  The 32 classes were  then described based on the average values of the environmental characteristics that were used to generate  the classes (for example, average altitude, slope and rainfall, and host of other environmental values).    The sampling framework for the first ecological survey of GB in 1978  Having generated the classification which would act as the sampling stratification system, the number of  samples to be surveyed was considered.  Ideally, this number would depend on the size of the stratum (ie how  many 1 km squares of the class occurred in GB) and on the ecological variability within the stratum.  Previous  work had suggested that for ecological surveys of this type, at least eight samples per stratum were  necessary.  Since this was the minimum requirement for each class, and resources were not available to  survey more squares, then eight were selected at random from each of the classes.  These squares were  taken from the grid of classified squares and thus the final sample for the first GB survey was a gridded,  stratified, random sample of 256 1 km squares.  The survey was actually carried out in the summers of 1977  (when a few pilot squares were sampled) and 1978 and focussed on vegetation quadrats and soils; habitat  areas were also mapped. 4 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007) The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey Table 1.

Map of ‘original’ (1978) ITE Land Classification 6 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007) The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey   The sampling framework for the second, land use survey of GB in 1984  In 1984, ITE funded a further GB survey although, by this time, the emphasis had shifted away from ecological  features such as soils and plant species in quadrats, to land use, landscape features and habitat mapping.   The same sampling framework was used as in 1978 but the sample size was increased by 50% so that 12  squares were surveyed in each of the 32 classes (including the eight squares previously visited).  With the  benefit of hindsight, there is an argument for having allocated the additional 128 new squares according to  land class size which would certainly have reduced the statistical error terms associated with national  estimates made from the sample.  However, this was not done.  Examples of change statistics between 1978  and 1984 were published in Barr et al.2    Application of the ITE Land Classification to Countryside Survey 1990   By 1990, and following the Ecological Consequences of Land Use Change (ECOLUC) programme carried out  by ITE on contract to the then Department of the Environment (DOE)3, both scientific and policy needs for a  further survey were identified.  Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990) was initiated with DOE, NERC, DTI and  NCC all contributing funding.  The first Land Cover Map of GB, derived from satellite imagery was also linked  to this programme.  Again, the ITE Land Classification was used as the sampling framework for a field survey but, in this third  survey, additional squares were allocated only to the larger land classes.  A total of 508 squares was surveyed  and all the features recorded in the 1984 survey, plus a repeat of the 1978 vegetation quadrats, was carried  out3.  The distribution of the squares within the Land Classes is shown in Table 2 and a map of sites is shown  as Figure 2.    Further development of the ITE Land Classification  CS1990 still used the original, gridded land classification that had been developed in the mid-1970s and  results were published based on the use of that system.  However, it became apparent that for estimations at  the regional and local level, the land classification had to be extended so that every square in GB was  classified.    Although computing power had increased considerably since the first classification, it was still an  insurmountable task to collect data for every square in GB at the same level of detail as had been done in the  original work.  Instead, the major climatic, geological and physiographic factors (or valid surrogates for these)  were obtained for each square and then a variety of multivariate classification procedures was tested on the  resulting dataset.  When the classes of the original sample of 1228 squares were compared with the new  classification attempts, the best simulation resulted in only a 62% correspondence.  However, all of the  squares that did not match exactly did fall into neighbouring land classes and the average characteristics of  the class remained unchanged, thus the classification was accepted as a reasonable replacement for its  earlier counterpart (Figure 3).    The net effect of this on the sampling framework was that as a result of some of the squares changing class,  the distribution across land classes was distorted and some classes were not well represented.  The effect of  this can be seen in column 3 of Table 2. 7 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007)  The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey   Figure 2.

Map of the ‘new’ (1990) ITE Land Classification. 9 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007)  The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey   Developments of the ITE Land Classification for Countryside Survey 2000  During the planning stages of Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000), there was consideration of sample  numbers in connection with several of the component modules.  This involved re-assessment of the existing  (CS1990) sample as well as the need for additional 1 km squares.  A number of issues have arisen from an  independent appraisal of CS1990 for policy purposes.  These include:  •  the effects of the changed ITE Land Classification.  •  the need to produce separate reliable estimates of surveyed features for Scotland and England with  Wales,  •  the need to provide statistically reliable estimates of upland habitats in England and Wales.  The new ITE Land Classification  As discussed above, the application of the new ITE Land Classification has resulted in some classes being  under-represented.  To correct this imbalance, a number of new squares were included as part of CS2000; the  details of how these are allocated are presented below, under ‘Separate country estimates’.  Separate country estimates  In CS1990, 508 1 km squares were sampled in England, Scotland, Wales and the Isle of Man.  The sample of  squares was drawn at random from a grid of squares in the 32 ITE Land Classes.  As described above, these  classes were created using underlying environmental attributes and therefore crossed country (E, S & W)  boundaries.  Country estimates were derived from the mean characteristics of all squares in each class,  irrespective of their country location.  A CS2000 Scoping Study34 recommended that the sampling framework should be modified to enable reporting  on ‘country units’, being (a) England with Wales and (b) Scotland, separately using only squares which lie in  the country for which estimates are to be made.  Additional samples have been deployed to assist with this requirement and the following changes have been  made to the sampling framework:  • class sub-division - the ITE Land Classes have been sub-divided into the ‘country unit’ versions of the  original classes,  • class aggregation - where this has resulted in there being very few squares of any particular class  remaining in a country, then this ‘rump’ has been aggregated with a similar class in that country (the net effect  of the class sub-divisions and aggregations is to create 40 strata, instead of the earlier 32),  • additional squares - to ensure that there is adequate representation of all new classes in each country unit,  19 additional squares have been allocated and this gives a minimum of 6 squares in each new class.  To  ensure relatively consistent sampling rates between England and Wales, a further 11 squares (5 in England  and 6 in Wales) have been allocated,  • Land Class 17 - Wales is dominated by Land Class 17 and to help refine the results reported for Wales, a  sub-division of Land Class 17 has been carried out in Wales.  In the allocation of any new squares in Wales  (either detailed above or in any further options), representation of the new sub-classes has been respected.  • Isle of Man – the two sample squares in the IOM included in previous surveys do not contribute to  estimates for ‘country units’ and are replaced by two new squares in England.  The revised land class maps for England with Wales and for Scotland are shown as Figure 4. 10 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007) The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey Figure 4.  Map of revised ITE Land Classes in ‘England with Wales’ and in Scotland – the  sampling framework for CS2000 11 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007)  The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey   Survey of uplands in England and Wales  An additional module within CS2000, funded by DETR, MAFF, and WO/CCW, included surveying an  additional 30 squares which have been placed in ITE Land Classes which occur in the uplands and marginal  uplands of England and Wales.  This gives better statistical accuracy to the estimates of habitats in the uplands of England and Wales which,  due to the need to provide separate, country-based estimates, would otherwise be under-sampled.

Since devolution, there has been an increasing need for the National Assembly of Wales  and environmental organisations to have access to habitat status and change information on a Wales-only  basis in order to meet the requirements of country-specific environmental policy and legislation.      Welsh-only Estimates    The adjustments in CS2000 included the addition of some Welsh squares, bringing their number up to 64, and  making Wales the most intensively sampled of the three individual countries (England 0.22%, Scotland 0.24%  and Wales 0.29% of total land area). However, in regard to the precision of national estimates, which depends  on absolute numbers rather than proportions, the number of field survey squares in Wales is low compared to  the number in Scotland (203) and England (302).   A scoping report in 200642 concludes that the existing  number of 64 squares in Wales was not adequate for Wales-only reporting for the 2007 survey.  As a consequence, the following changes were made to the 2000 sampling framework for 2007:  •  Class sub-divisions – the ITE Land Classes have been sub-divided into the ‘country unit’ (England and  Wales) versions of the original land classes creating five new classes: 5w, 6w, 7w,15w,18w  •  Number of classes - the effect of the class sub-divisions is to create 45 strata instead of the earlier 40  •  Additional squares – to ensure that there is adequate representation of new classes in Wales, a total of  43 additional squares were surveyed in Wales, this gives a minimum of 6 squares in each Welsh class.  •  Additional squares in England to compensate for the removal of Welsh squares were not warranted.   Two of the English Classes (5e, 15e) are left with only 4 squares per class, however, the 2006 scoping  study42 states the reduction in precision of English estimates is relatively small and the small number of  squares in these classes should still be adequate for reporting purposes.    The revised class map for England, Wales and Scotland is shown in figure 6. 15 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007)  The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey   Figure 6.

Estimates for GB for example can be  calculated either using the latest classification (effectively three separate classifications for the three countries)  or the original (1990) classification.  For consistency with in an individual survey the former approach is  preferred whilst the latter is more consistent across surveys’.

The UK Environmental Change Network Protocols for Standard Measurements at Terrestrial Sites  © NERC 2001        ECN is a multi-agency organisation, co-ordinated by CEH on behalf of NERC     www.ecn.ac.uk  INITIAL WATER HANDLING (WH)  Version 1.1 (updated Nov 2001)    To measure the conductivity and pH of samples of precipitation,  soil solution and river water and to filter these samples prior to  chemical analysis    From the moment water samples are gathered they begin to deteriorate as a  result of chemical and microbiological processes.  Three methods of slowing  this deterioration are to be used in ECN - filtration, cold storage, and (for Al and  Fe determinations only) acidification.  Some of the activities detailed in this  Protocol require laboratory training, experience, specialised equipment, and  compliance with health and safety requirements (eg diluting concentrated  acids); guidance or help from the chemists who will perform the water analyses  may also be required.  Further background and quality control procedures are  given in the documents referred to below.    Initial storage    Samples must be placed in cold storage, at a temperature between 1°C and  4°C, if the interval between collection and the measurement of conductivity and  pH is more than seven hours.  They should be returned to cold storage if  filtering is not completed on the same day as these measurements.  If samples  are to be sent to another site for initial handling, they should be sent on the day  of collection by the speediest possible method. Samples in transit must be  placed in a cool box with pre-frozen cool blocks.    Conductivity measurement    Conductivity must be measured within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered  subsample at a temperature of 25°C according to the method given by HMSO  (1978).  Results should be expressed to one decimal place (0.1 µS cm-1).    pH measurement    pH must be measured within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample.   The same subsample can be used both for conductivity and for pH  measurement, but conductivity should be measured first and the subsample  should not be returned to the main sample after measurement.  The method to  be used is given in HMSO (1988) which implies the use of separate glass and  reference electrodes. Results should be expressed to two decimal places (0.01  pH unit).    Filtering     Filtering must take place within 60 hours of collection.  The method to be used  is given in Appendix I.  Filtering details should be recorded, using the unique  sample codes described in the Protocols (also described in Appendix I of this  Protocol).   After filtration the samples are to be analysed for dissolved Na+, K+,  Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4 +-N, Cl-, NO3 --N, SO4 2--S, PO4 3—P, alkalinity and  dissolved organic carbon (DOC).  DOC is not mandatory for precipitation water  and can be omitted.   Separate documentation  is provided for chemical  analysis (see AG Protocol) in which the determinands are placed in an order of  priority for those occasions on which sample volume is insufficient to allow the  measurement of all determinands.    Storage prior to chemical analysis    Storage temperature should be between 1°C and 4°C.  Analysis should be  completed preferably within 16 days of collection but definitely within 28 days.  If  samples have to be sent to another location for analysis, the period when  WH Protocol     Aim       Rationale                 Method The UK Environmental Change Network Protocols for Standard Measurements at Terrestrial Sites  © NERC 2001        ECN is a multi-agency organisation, co-ordinated by CEH on behalf of NERC     www.ecn.ac.uk  samples are out of cold storage should be minimised, for example by specifying  next day delivery and not despatching on a Friday.

Filtering    • Filter funnel assembly - most modern filter assemblies are suitable, eg the  Millipore Sterifil which holds 47 mm diameter filters (Millipore catalogue no.  XX11 047 00)  • Membrane filters (only) - Whatman, type WCN, pore size 0.45 µm,  obtainable, for example, from BDH, catalogue no. (to fit the above filtering  system) 402/0723/04  • Glass fibre filters - Whatman, type GF/C, obtainable, for example, from BDH,  catalogue no. (to fit the above filtering system) 234/0856/11  • Vacuum pump - a pump capable of maintaining a vacuum of approximately  0.5 bar    All parts of the filter funnel assembly must be thoroughly rinsed with deionised  or distilled water before the first sample and between subsequent samples.  The  filters and the surfaces of the filter assembly which come into contact with the  water sample must not be touched by hand.  Filters should be moved with  forceps and each filter should be used for only one sample.  Waters originating  from soil solution (SS) and rivers (WQ) may need pre-filtering through a glass  fibre filter but these filters require washing with 250 ml of distilled water before  use.  The filtered water should be poured from the filter assembly into a clean,  dry polypropylene bottle and not returned to the bottle used for the unfiltered  water.  A bottle of 250 ml volume is likely to be appropriate, but the laboratory  performing the analyses should be consulted.  If the volume of a sample  exceeds 100 ml, a subsample of 20 ml should be transferred from each sample  to a vial for determination of Al and Fe, and acidified with 20 µl HCl.     All containers should be labelled as follows:  - ECN Site Identification Code (eg T06),  - ECN Measurement Code (eg PC),  - Location Code (eg 01),  - Sampling Date  along with any additional instrument/sampler code necessary to uniquely  identify the sample (eg SS sampler code). This unique reference should appear  with the final data submitted for inclusion in the ECN database.

Bottle and vial washing    Containers must be washed in a laboratory cleaning agent before being used  for the first time, and subsequently at approximately six-monthly intervals, or if  subjected to high levels of soiling (eg contamination of rainfall by bird  droppings).  The cleaning agent should be free of phosphate and hypochlorite.   If a laboratory washing machine is available, Decomatic (not Dri-Decon) is  suitable, and, if no machine is available, over-night soaking in Decon-90 is  suitable.  Subsequently, containers will be rinsed four times in tap water and  three times in deionised or distilled water.  At other times, after use, containers  will be rinsed three times in distilled water and retained for use with the same  sampler on subsequent occasions.    After washing, containers must be shaken to remove drops of distilled water,  dried in warm air in a dust-free environment, and re-capped immediately.

Quality Assurance Report: surveying condition of  headwater streams and ponds      JOHN MURPHY, PENNY WILLIAMS1, PETER SCARLETT & RALPH CLARKE2                                                                                           1 Pond Conservation, Oxford Brookes University, Gipsy Lane, Headington, Oxford, OX4 2PD.  2 School of Conservation Sciences, Bournemouth University, Christchurch House, Talbot Campus,  Poole, Dorset, BH12 5BB, UK Introduction  The freshwater module of Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007) aimed to provide high- quality information on changes in the physical and biological condition of small  streams and ponds across Great Britain.  Changes in the distribution of components of  biological diversity in these habitats were also measured.  In order to be confident in the data gathered and derived results, it was necessary to  first, ensure that the CS field surveyors were sufficiently experienced, skilled and  adequately trained to do the job.  Therefore:  • All freshwater field surveyors recruited were required to have a solid knowledge  of aquatic plant taxonomy and received detailed training on all aspects of the CS  freshwater tasks.  • All freshwater field surveyors undertaking River Habitat Surveys (RHS) were  Environment Agency accredited.  • An experienced freshwater biologist visited teams in the field to ensure that they  were adhering to the methods and to assist them with any issues.  Second, it was necessary to ensure that any laboratory analytical procedures were  carried out to the highest standards.  Therefore:   • Water chemistry analysis was carried by a CEH laboratory which is ISO 17025  accredited by UK Accreditation Service (UKAS).  • All macroinvertebrate samples are being processed using the strict laboratory  protocols of the CEH River Communities Group (the Group that audits all  regulatory biomonitoring carried out by the UK environment agencies), and by  staff with taxonomic accreditation from the Natural History Museum.   Thirdly, it was also important to quantify the uncertainty associated with the  collection of data in the field.  Therefore:  • An experienced CEH freshwater biologist repeated the freshwater tasks at a  random-stratified sub-sample of squares to assess error/variation in the data  collected and the derived condition measures.  This technical report focuses on this final aspect of the CS freshwater quality  assurance (QA) process.  While the biological sampling of freshwater habitats has been part of CS since 1990,  there were no properly coordinated QA surveys undertaken in either 1990 or 1998.   Therefore the CS2007 QA report acts as a baseline against which future Surveys can  be judged. Field Survey Methods  At a random-stratified sub-sample of 31 squares that had been successfully surveyed  by CS2007 field surveyors, an experienced CEH freshwater biologist repeated the  freshwater tasks carried out by the main CS survey teams.  Squares were chosen to  incorporate all environmental zones and CS field survey teams as much as possible.  In all 31 squares a stream was re-sampled, while 18 of the 31 squares contained a  pond, which was re-surveyed.  This represents an 8% re-survey effort for the stream  tasks and a 7% re-survey effort for the pond tasks.    Fig. 1 Location of the freshwater quality assurance squares  Headwater Streams  Aquatic Plants  At 30 of the 31 QA stream sites (one stream site was dry when QA surveyed) an  experienced CEH freshwater biologist repeated the aquatic plant survey at the same  location as that surveyed for CS2000.  The 100m survey stretch was centred on the  invert sampling location.  The QA exercise incorporated the ability of the CS2007  team to accurately re-locate the survey stretch.  Both the CS team and the QA  surveyor used a combination of photographs, grid references and map annotations to  re-locate the CS2000 aquatic plant survey stretch.  Both the CS team and the QA surveyor used IRIS on a Tablet PC to record the plant and associated environmental  data.  Countryside Survey Technical Report No. 5/07 provides more details of the aquatic  plant survey method and IRIS, the digital data entry system.  River Habitat Survey  At each of the 31 stream sites a River Habitat Survey was carried out at the same  location as that surveyed for CS2000.  The RHS QA exercise incorporated the ability  of the CS2007 team to accurately re-locate the 500m CS2000 RHS stretch.  Both the  CS team and the QA surveyor used the same set of photographs, grid references and  map annotations to re-locate the 500m CS2000 RHS stretch.  Both the CS team and the QA surveyor used RAPID on a Tablet PC to record the  RHS data.  The RHS method involves various physical features of the stream channel  and banks e.g. bank material, channel substrate, riparian vegetation structure, being  recorded at 10 equally-spaced transects.  Additionally an overall assessment or other  features e.g. number of riffles, pools & weirs, bank profile, riparian land-use is made  for the full 500 m survey reach.  CS Technical Report No. 5/07 provides more details  of the RHS method and RAPID, the digital data entry system.  Aquatic Macroinvertebrates  At 30 of the 31 QA stream sites (one stream site was dry when QA surveyed) an  experienced CEH freshwater biologist took an aquatic macroinvertebrate community  sample at the same location as that sampled for CS2000.  The QA exercise  incorporated the ability of the CS2007 team to accurately re-locate the sample site.   Both the CS team and the QA surveyor used a combination of photographs, grid  references and map annotations to re-locate the CS2000 sample site.  Both the CS  team and the QA surveyor used standard macroinvertebrate sampling protocols when  collecting the sample and recording associated environmental data (see CS Technical  Report No. 5/07 for more details).  These sampled are currently being processed by  the CEH River Communities Group and the results of the macroinvertebrate QA  analysis will be reported as part of the main Freshwaters Report, due out in late 2009.  Hydrochemistry  At 30 of the 31 QA stream sites (one stream site was dry when QA surveyed) a water  sample was taken for laboratory analysis of phosphate, nitrogen and alkalinity  concentrations.  The pH and conductivity of the stream water were measured on-site  using a calibrated field meter.    Ponds  Aquatic Plants  At 18 of the 31 QA squares an experienced CEH freshwater biologist re-surveyed the  same randomly-selected pond that was surveyed by the CS team.  Both the CS team  and the QA surveyor used standard pond surveying protocols when recording the  aquatic plant community and associated environmental data (see CS Technical Report  No. 5/07 for more details). Hydrochemistry  At 15 of the 18 re-surveyed ponds a water sample was taken for laboratory analysis of  phosphate, nitrogen and alkalinity concentrations.  The pH and conductivity of the  pond water were measured on-site using a calibrated field meter. Data Analysis & Results  Headwater Streams  Aquatic Plants  Initially, the plant data were validated; a process which included taxonomic  standardisation and removal of terrestrial species from the database.  Following  validation, there were 29 QA sites surveyed with aquatic plants and 1 site QA- surveyed with no aquatic flora.  We can consider the aquatic plant surveys to be analogous to the terrestrial vegetation  plots in that the cover of all species within the survey area is recorded.  The quality of  the work is judged by comparing concordance between the main CS surveyor and the  QA surveyor in the species recorded.  Initially the number of plant taxa found at each of the 29 squares, by the main and QA  surveys was compared.  We found that there was a significant bias (P<0.001) evident  in the data, with the main survey tending to find 1.9 (± 0.87 95%CL) fewer taxa than  the QA.  A more informative measure of the quality of the data is to compare the CS2007 and  CS2007QA species lists for each of the 29 sites and to calculate the % agreement (%  of all taxa recorded at a site, that were recorded by both the main and QA surveyors).   Mean % agreement was only 31%, with there being 100% agreement only at those  few sites where only a single species was found in both surveys.  Reasons for these  discrepancies include: misidentifications and inadequate searching, differences in the  exact location of the 100m survey reach, seasonal differences in the plant community  between the survey dates (Fig. 2), vegetation cutting between the two surveys and  difficulties in defining the lateral limits of the survey area.  0 25 50 75 100 -20 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 No of days between CS2007QA and CS2007 surveys % Agreement   Fig. 2 Relationship between time difference (days) between main CS2207 survey and QA  survey and % agreement of plant survey results Over 80% of the errors involved species that were rare at the site i.e. with a recorded  cover less than 1%.  This highlights the importance of undertaking a thorough search  of the full 100m site.  There was no pronounced bias towards marginal species being  more likely to be missed than those more restricted to in-stream habitats.  Over 60%  of the errors were those where species were considered to have been overlooked by  the main CS surveyor.  Only 15% of the errors were likely to have involved species  incorrectly identified and forming an obvious couplet with another species identified  by the QA surveyor.  Among the most commonly missed taxa were the liverwort Pelia sp.,the moss  Rhynchostegium riparioides, the marginal grass Agrostis stolonifera and algae such as  Cladophera and Vaucheria.  These differences between the main and QA surveys had an effect on the derived  MTR scores.  On average the QA surveys tended to score 5.6 (± 10.6 95%CL) more  than the main survey.  While this was not a statistically significant bias, there was a  considerable range of differences between the two surveys.  Ultimately, the QA analysis has highlighted the difficulty inherent in repeating an  aquatic plant survey.  Even at a stream site where the QA and main surveys were on  the same day and both teams met each other at the site, there were substantial  differences in the species lists (only 57% agreement).  As there were no QA data for CS2000 we can only assume that the CS2000 surveyors  were of equal standard to those in CS2007.  Hence we have to assume that the level of  bias in taxon richness was similar in both years and would not affect any change  estimates.  Therefore analysis of the main CS2007 data can proceed without the need  for any corrections or adjustments, while being mindful of the data quality issues.   These QA data act as a baseline for the next CS and will inform efforts to improve  field protocols and highlights plant groups where greater expertise is required.  River Habitat Survey  The RHS QA analysis focussed on the degree of variation in the 2007 RHS data  between the CS and QA surveyors.  Initially a simple objective test of concordance  between the main CS and QA surveys was undertaken where the numbers of a range  of distinct features within the 500m survey stretch i.e. bridges and culverts, were  recorded.  At 70% of the sites there was no difference between the main and QA surveys in the  count of bridges or culverts.  Five of the 31 sites had discrepancies ±1 in the bridge  estimates.  Six of the 31 sites had discrepancies ±1 in the culvert estimates and one  with a difference of two.  The reasons for the discrepancies are probably related to  slight differences in the location 500m stretch, such that some bridges or culverts may  have been included for the main survey while excluded from the QA survey.  Habitat Quality Assessment (HQA) values were generated from the CS2007 and QA  data for the 31 stream sites.  The HQA score increases as the diversity and abundance  of natural river channel and bank features increases within the 500m stretch.  The  HQA tends to vary from 10-80, with no one hydromorphological feature dominating  the scores. Since the RHS data will ultimately be reported as HQA index values it is  most appropriate that a QA assessment is made through the combined impact of all  the surveyor decisions, relocation and counting errors on this measure.

Difference in RHS HQA score between the QA and main CS surveys.  Difference in HQA score between QA and original survey Frequency 10 0 -10 -20 -30 8 6 4 2 0 X _ Ho Histogram of Differences (with 95% t-confidence interval for the mean) For the 31 squares re-surveyed in CS2007 as part of the QA exercise we calculated  the average difference in HQA between the main survey and the QA survey (CS2007- CS2007QA).  We found that there was a significant bias (P<0.001) evident in the  HQA results, with the main survey tending to score 6.9 (± 3.3 95% CL) units greater  than the QA survey (Table 1, Fig 3).  Indeed none of the 31 squares received the same  overall HQA score from the CS and QA surveys.  Much of the HQA variation could  be traced to differences between the main and QA surveyors in how they classified  the structural complexity of the bank-face and bank-top vegetation.  This was a  particular issue in moorland landscapes where CS surveyors tended to interpret open  moorland vegetation with Molinia grass and heather clumps as ‘Simple’ while the QA  survey recorded it as ‘Uniform’.  These features score differently in the HQA scoring  system.  While the RHS manual does provide guidance on vegetation types, there is a  degree of ambiguity that obviously does lead to differing judgements.  As a result of  this difference, the QA sites in upland environmental zones were those with greatest  disparity in overall HQA between the two surveys.  As there are no QA data available for CS2000, the most precautionary and defensible  approach is to assume that both CS2000 and CS2007 are equally biased.  Therefore  analysis of the main CS2007 RHS data can proceed without the need for any  corrections or adjustments, while being mindful of the data quality issues.  Hydrochemistry  The concentrations of most hydrochemical parameters can vary considerably over  even short time-scales; making comparison of two separate water samples from the  same site difficult to judge.  However we would not expect the ranking of the 31 sites  based on values of a given parameter to differ substantially.  Therefore simple rank  correlation between the main and QA values across the 31sites for each of the five  measured parameters gives an indication of the repeatability of the hydrochemistry  survey.  There were highly significant correlations between the ranked values in the QA and  main survey for the five measured parameters; soluble reactive phosphorus (r = 0.89,  P < 0.001), total oxidised nitrogen (r = 0.79, P < 0.001), alkalinity (r = 0.97, P <  0.001), pH (r = 0.74, P < 0.01) and conductivity (r = 0.97, P < 0.001).  This indicates  that both the field and laboratory procedures were consistently applied and that we  can have confidence in the measured results.  Ponds  Wetland Plants  For 16 of the 31 QA squares there was a pond surveyed in both the main and QA  surveys. The number of wetland plant taxa found at each of the 16 ponds, by the main  and QA surveys was compared.  We found that there was no significant bias  (P>0.214) evident in the data, with the main survey tending to find 0.6 (± 1.03  95%CL) more taxa than the QA.  Mean percentage agreement was 59%, with 100% agreement at five of the ponds.   Reasons for the discrepancies include: misidentifications and inadequate searching,  differences in defining the outer boundary of the pond (maximum winter water level)  and seasonal differences in the plant community between the survey dates. There were a total of 36 taxa missed by either the CS or QA surveyor; though 29 of  the 36 taxa were only missed on one occasion.  These 29 taxa were from a range of  plant groups: eight taxa were grass/sedge/rush species, eight were small-leaved  submerged aquatics, which are easy to miss. The remaining 13 taxa included  representatives from most the other plant types.  In total, seven taxa were missed at  more than one site.  All seven were grass, sedge or rush-like species. More  specifically: cotton-grasses, deergrass, rushes, sedges, creeping bent. Of these, soft  rush (Juncus effusus) and creeping bent (Agrostis stolonifera) were the most  commonly missed species.  The fact that the most frequently missed plants were grass  or rush-like taxa is notable and can be used to inform future CS training.      CS2007 was the first Countryside Survey to collect plant survey data from ponds  across Britain. The QA data will act as a baseline for any future plant surveys of the  CS ponds.  Hydrochemistry  There were significant correlations between the ranked values in the QA and main  survey for four of the five measured parameters; soluble reactive phosphorus (r =  0.60, P < 0.05), alkalinity (r = 0.95, P < 0.001), pH (r = 0.84, P < 0.001) and  conductivity (r = 0.98, P < 0.001).  However, the total oxidised nitrogen values did  vary between the QA and main survey (r = 0.47, P = 0.12).  In particular, there were  two ponds that differed considerably in the measured TON levels between the main  and QA survey.  For both these ponds there was a 2 month gap between both visits.   The results again reinforce the need to keep the QA and main surveys as close  together in time.  However overall the field and laboratory procedures were  consistently applied and we can have confidence in the measured results. Discussion  There is inherent uncertainty associated with any environmental measurement (Clarke  & Hering 20063).  The quality assurance survey described here provides a first  indication of the variability associated with the freshwater data within Countryside  Survey.  This information can be used to inform our ability to confidently detect  change, to better target training of surveyors, and also to refine protocols, including  freshwater QA protocols.  The variation/error associated with a given record, measurement or index score can be  attributed to a variety of sources.  For example, when undertaking a stream aquatic  plant survey the error associated with the species richness value is derived from a  combination of spatial errors (accurately locating the survey stretch, defining the  stream lateral margins), temporal errors (natural changes to the plant community  between repeat surveys, changes due to prior disturbance events), and inter-surveyor  competence (ability to thoroughly search survey stretch and correctly identify any  plants found) and finally residual un-attributed error.  The purpose of the CS QA survey was to quantify the extent of the error associated  with inter-surveyor competence.  However it is impossible to isolate this source of  error from the spatial and temporal sources of error.  In CS2007 we sought to reduce  the contribution or chance of temporal error by carrying out the QA and main survey  as close in time to each other as possible; though this was not always achieved (Fig.  2).  The extent of spatial error inevitably overlaped with inter-surveyor competence as  the ability to accurately locate the CS2000 survey stretch was dependent on the  surveyor.  CS and QA surveyors may also have differed in their judgement as to the  location of the lateral limits of the survey stretch.  The CS2007 QA survey found that there was variation between the main and QA  results for the stream plant survey and river habitat survey.  However, it is difficult to  sub-divide the total variation into the different compartments, in particular we did not  manage to minimise the influence of temporal error.  Many of the QA surveys were  carried out many weeks after the original survey.  This undermined our ability to draw  strong conclusions from the QA results, especially in relation to the plant surveys.  Given the subjective nature of some of the data recorded as part of a RHS e.g.  classifying bank vegetation structure, it is not surprising that there is a degree of  variability between the CS and QA results.  However, you would expect near identical  information when it came to counts of bridges and culverts within the 500m survey  reach.  This was achieved for 22 of the 31 QA sites (70%).  That there were  differences illustrates the difficulty in accurately measuring out a 500m survey stretch  along a potentially sinuous water course.  Ultimately the CS2007 freshwater QA survey acts as a baseline against which the  standard of future CS freshwater surveys can be compared.  It has also provided us  with invaluable information on the elements of the field protocols that are most  vulnerable to mis-interpretation or that are most difficult to accurately repeat.  We can  focus more on these features when planning training for the next survey.  In particular this includes:  • Improved identification skills for aquatic bryophytes and algae                                                   3 Clarke, R.T & D. Hering (2006) Errors and uncertainty in bioassessment methods- major results and conclusions  from the STAR projectand their application using STARBUGS. Hydrobiologia 566: 433=439. • Increased awareness of bryophytes, algae and inconspicuous grass-like species  during plant survey.  • Greater emphasis on importance of returning exactly to previous survey stretch  • Reinforcement of RHS training with particular attention to elements known to be  more prone to error or subjective judgement.  This first CS freshwater QA survey has also highlighted the need to ensure the QA  work at a site is carried out within two weeks of the main survey team completing  their work at that same location.  The Freshwater Technical Report, due out in late 2009 will contain details of the  macroinvertebrate QA analysis and results.

To help get the most from this data and to guard against inappropriate use it is  important that you familiarise yourself with the information in this document.  Land cover change – users are advised not to use the LCM series for change  mapping in their current state.   Differences between land cover maps are a combination of real change and  classification error, which is compounded by the thematic and spatial differences  between the LCM products over time. 4    Introduction  Land Cover Map 2015 (LCM2015) is provided as a range of data products to support the  diverse requirements of the LCM user community. This report provides a brief introduction  to key aspects of the LCM2015 data sets for users and potential users.   This document only covers LCM2015 data products, for details about previous Land Cover  Maps please consult the appropriate dataset documents.  Background  Land Cover Map 2015 (LCM2015) is a parcel-based land cover map for the UK, created by classifying  satellite data into 21 land cover classes. The classes are based on the UK Biodiversity Action Plan  Broad Habitat definitions (Jackson, 2000). LCM2015 was created by classifying two-date composite  images and is based mainly on data from Landsat-8 (30m resolution) supplemented with AWIFS data  (60m resolution) as required. LCM2015 updates the 2007 Land Cover Map and uses an updated  version of the LCM2007 spatial framework. LCM2015, like LCM2007 before it, is therefore  constructed from polygons that reflect real-world boundaries. This increases both its ease of  interpretation for users and also its compatibility with other geospatial data sets.    The LCM2015 spatial framework was derived from generalised digital cartography (Ordnance Survey  MasterMap topographic layer (OSMM) for GB and Land & Property Services Large-scale Vector for  Northern Ireland), refined with rural payment boundary data (see Morton et al., 2011 for details).     Differences from LCM2007  Users should be aware that some changes in data format have taken place between  LCM2007 and LCM2015. Consequently, users should check all aspects of the data product  they intend to use, prior to applying scripts written for LCM2007 data.    To date each Land Cover Map has adopted a slightly different method, reflecting the range of  influences and the key requirements at the time of production. These influences include evolving  user needs, methodological developments, increased availability and accessibility of other spatial  data sets and increases in computing power. LCM2015 continues this trend, by reflecting a need to  increase the speed of production and decrease the amount of manual input in the production  process. This is driven by both a need to release the data in a more timely manner and to create a  repeatable method that can be used for mapping change. Consequently a number of modifications  to the method have been made and these are described below under two headings, first, the  changes that affect the output data and secondly, methodological differences that do not affect the  output data.       Differences in output data  1. ‘Montane’ class removed – The montane class was removed, because in LCM2007 it was  mapped purely as a function of a variable altitude threshold (Morton et al., 2011), rather  than from the spectral data. LCM2015 would have adopted the same approach and the  same set of altitude thresholds, consequently, the ‘Montane’ distribution would be constant  over time. Therefore to enable the move to both a method and a set of classes that are  appropriate for change mapping this class was removed. Areas mapped as ‘Montane’ in  LCM2007 are therefore mapped based on the spectral data in LCM2015 and are mapped as  ‘Inland Rock’ or one of the other upland habitats. This improves the suitability of the LCM- 5    series for mapping change in the future. Anyone requiring the distribution of ‘Montane’ for  the UK should use the LCM2007 distribution. This change affects all products.    2. Rough grassland class removed – The rough grassland class was first added in LCM2007. For  LCM2007 grassland was mapped by classifying images into ‘Improved Grassland’ and Rough  grassland, after which knowledge-based enhancement (KBE) rules were applied. The KBEs,  taking account the ancillary data, such as soil type, aspect and elevation suggested whether  Rough grassland should be assigned to   ‘Neutral Grassland’, ‘Calcareous Grassland’ or ‘Acid  Grassland, or whether it should remain as Rough grassland (Morton et al., 2011). This  caused problems for a number of reasons, including:  a. Lack of consistent soil data across the UK (and across GB)  b. Link between soil type, as recorded in spatial data sets, and grassland type is often  complicated  c. Analysis of Rough grassland mapped by LCM2007 against Countryside Survey data  showed that it was predominantly a mix of ‘Improved grassland’ and ‘Neutral  grassland’.  d. The LCM2015 method requires stable training areas, defined as areas that have  remained constant across LCM2000 and LCM2007, because Rough grassland was not  used in LCM2000.  For all of these reasons, the Rough grassland class was removed, so in LCM2015 grassland  types again match the JNCC Broad Habitat types. No soil data was used in the LCM2015  classification. This change affects all the target class products (vector, 25m and 1km).    3. 25m raster – the 25m raster is a two band image, rather than a single band image, as in  previous LCMs. The first layer contains the classification layer and the second band contains  the mean per-polygon probability value produced by the classification algorithm. This  change affects the 25m raster data only.    4. Differences in the way probability data is recorded – probability information for LCM2007  was given in the ProbList attribute, with the top 5 spectral sub-classes and their respective  probabilities listed. Probability information for LCM2015 is simplified and streamlined, with  the mean probability of the majority class recorded in the vector data and this value (the  mean per polygon probability) given in band 2 of the 25m raster. Probability information is  not given for the 1km products, as it is not appropriate at that scale. This change affects the  vector and 25m raster only.    5. No spectral sub-classes – LCM2007 used a maximum likelihood classification algorithm,  which required training samples for each class to be grouped into spectrally similar sub- classes. This, in conjunction with the extensive field data, led to the development of spectral  sub-classes. LCM2015 uses a Random Forest classifier that handles multi-modal classes, so  the grouping of spectrally similar sub-classes is not required. This simplifies the process of  preparing training data for classification and means that spectral sub-classes are redundant.  LCM was never validated at the spectral sub-class level and users were always urged to use  caution if using the sub-class data, so this is unlikely to impact many users. This change  affects the vector data only. 6    6. Spatial framework - For LCM2007 the spatial framework derived from the generalised digital  cartography was further refined with image segments, however for LCM2015 polygons  created by these segments have been removed. The segmentation used in LCM2007 was  used to ‘break-up’ large polygons, for example those found in upland areas, into smaller  polygons. There were problems with the segmentation in many cases, as it can vary  significantly with image and with segmentation parameters. For LCM2007, often the image  segmented and incorporated into the spatial framework for an area was not the image that  produced the best classification for the area. Consequently, the segmentation polygons did  not always match the final classifications well and they did not always capture real-world  objects well. Applying different segmentation for different LCMs will also complicate change  mapping, so for these reasons no segmentation has been incorporated in the LCM2015  spatial framework. Identifying the perfect spatial framework for LCM and related products  like CEH LCM Plus: Crops will require balancing competing requirements, as the underlying  LCM2015 product is the per-pixel classification it will be possible to summarise it against  different frameworks in the future if required. The removal of segmentation in LCM2015 will  mainly affect upland areas and will not affect Northern Ireland, as no segmentation was  added to the Northern Ireland LCM2007 data set. In addition some errors in the spatial  framework have been fixed. These changes will affect users of the GB vector data and the  GB 25m raster.    7. Mixed woodland – according to the JNCC Broad Habitat definitions a woodland with > 20%  Deciduous woodland is classified as mixed woodland and as such recorded under the  ‘Broadleaf, Mixed and Yew Woodland’ class (see also Appendices 1 & 2). For LCM2007  object-based classification methods were applied and mixed woodland stands were selected  and used for training. In LCM2015 pure stands of Coniferous or Broadleaf woodland were  chosen for training, with individual pixels being classified. The pixels are then summarised at  the polygon level, with the modal_class (Table 2) being assigned as the polygon label. This  means that some mixed woodland with > 20% Broadleaf cover is likely to be assigned to the  ‘Coniferous Woodland’ class, rather than the Broadleaved woodland class, users interested  in investigating this can explore the pix_dist attribute in the vector product. This change will  affect all products.  Differences in methodology  1. New classification algorithm – LCM2015 uses a Random Forest classifier, whilst LCM2007  used a Maximum Likelihood Classifier. The key advantage of changing to Random Forest is  that it handles multi-model training data, so training samples do not need grouping into  spectral sub-classes. In addition, Random Forest has been found to match or out-perform  Maximum Likelihood.    2. Stable training areas – for previous LCMs all the training areas used to train the classification  algorithm have been manually defined. This time, building upon the LCM legacy, an initial set  of training areas, defined as areas that were classified the same in both 2000 and 2007, was  used for classification. This initial set was then manually supplemented with additional  training areas for coastal areas (inter-tidal areas were removed from the stable data set, due  to issues with tidal state in the images; sea water was also removed) and classes that LCM 7    has traditionally mapped poorly, such as ‘Fen, Marsh and Swamp’  and the semi-natural  grassland types.    3. Ancillary data and Knowledge-based enhancements – for LCM2007 ancillary data, such as  altitude and soil type data, were applied post-classification to minimise classification errors.  For example, to remove coastal classes from mountainsides that should have been classified  as ‘Inland Rock’ using an altitude-based rule. This process was difficult and time-consuming  as it required the identification of a systematic error and then the definition of a rule that  would correct the error; when classifications cover large areas this is difficult to judge and it  becomes a very subjective process. For LCM2015 the ancillary data sets are part of the input  data along with the satellite data, so the classification algorithm uses the ancillary data as  required making the knowledge-based enhancements objective and an integral part of the  process.    LCM2015 product specification  LCM2015 maps land cover (not land use)  LCM2015 maps land cover and whilst this may be synonymous with land use it will not be in all  cases. For example, an arable crop cover denotes arable land use, but often land use cannot be  inferred, as, for example, grass used for recreation looks very similar to that which is grazed.    LCM2015 is a stable, archived data set and as such each data set has a Digital Object Identifier  (DOI)  The DOI’s should be cited when referring to the data set in publications (see Citing LCM2015  (DOI’s)).    LCM2015 sets a minimum mappable area of >0.5 ha  Parcels less than 0.5ha and linear features less than 20m were dissolved into the surrounding  landscape during the production process.     LCM2015 classes  LCM2015 maps 21 classes (Table 1), which are based on the UKs terrestrial Broad Habitats (Jackson  et al., 2000). In some cases, the Broad Habitats can be reliably divided further, based on their  spectral signatures, so:    The ‘Built-up Areas and Gardens’ Broad habitat is divided into ‘Suburban’ and ‘Urban’  classes.    The ‘Dwarf Shrub Heath’ is divided into ‘Heather’ and ‘Heather grassland’ classes.    The ‘Littoral Sediment’ Broad Habitat is divided into ‘Littoral sediment’ and ‘Saltmarsh’ (a  Priority Habitat).  LCM2015 has unique object labelling  During the production process each parcel is given a unique label which is stored in the Geometry Id  (gid) attribute. All users of the LCM2015 vector products will receive data containing this attribute. It  is recommended that the gid attribute is retained within the LCM2015 data set and any  developments of it. This will allow unambiguous communication between LCM2015 users. 8    LCM2015 has rich metadata  During the production of LCM2015, like LCM2007 and LCM2000 before it, information about  processing has been retained where possible. The LCM2015 vector data set therefore has a rich set  of metadata for each polygon. The polygon attributes provide details about the dominant class for  the polygon, but also a breakdown of the number of pixels classified as each land cover class in the  polygon and the mean probability for the polygon from the classification algorithm.     LCM2015 has uncertainty information  The Random Forest classifier produces an estimate of per-pixel probability. This is included as a  mean per-polygon value in the vector and in the 25m raster.    LCM2015 has a range of data products  The Land Cover Maps cater to a wide range of users requiring the data in a range of formats.  LCM2015 has the ‘core’ vector data set, a 25m classification product, as well as percentage and  dominant cover products at 1km. The 1km products are available in either the 21 target classes or  grouped into 10 aggregate classes.    LCM2015 product overview   LCM2015 is distributed in a range of data formats and at a range of thematic and spatial resolutions  to supports the diverse range of LCM applications. The ‘core’ product is the LCM2015 vector from  which the 25m raster is derived. The 25m raster is then used to produce the 1km percentage cover  products for both the 21 target classes and the 10 aggregate classes (Table 1), which in turn are used  to create the dominant cover products. Notes on each of the LCM classes are included in Appendix  1.          Figure 1. LCM2015 data products. 9    Table 1. Relationship between Aggregate classes, Broad Habitat and LCM2015 classes.

Spatially the vector data set and the 25m raster data set are  quite similar, however, the advantage of the vector data set is that each polygon has a set of  metadata attached. The disadvantage of the vector is that this increases the file size and may make  processing unwieldy for many applications/users. The 25m raster data set maybe useful in such  circumstances, as it provides the same land cover detail, but without all of the metadata information  and the polygon boundaries; this is more appropriate for many applications. The 1km data sets are  typically used for modelling the whole of the UK in conjunction with other data, such as  meteorological data or species distribution data. They are created by calculating the percentage of  the 1km square covered by each class (e.g. urban) based on the distribution of the class (e.g. urban)  in the 25m raster data set. Figure 3 shows the 1km aggregate percentage cover for ‘Built-up areas  and gardens’ across the UK. 10        Figure 2.

The nine attributes include land cover class (as text and integer), source image, uncertainty  information, the number of pixels recorded for each class and the proportion of the polygon  classified as the dominant class (Table 2). The vector data set contains 6.7 million polygons for Great  Britain and 0.9 million for Northern Ireland.     Table 2. Description of the attributes of the LCM2015 vector data set.

BHAB  Dominant land cover at Broad Habitat level e.g. Improved grassland  Pix_dist  List of 23 numbers giving the number of pixels of each class within the polygon (numbers 1- 21), followed by the number of pixels in the polygon and the majority class (note – these  final two are given as the npix and modal_class attributes in their own right).  unc  Uncertainty – mean per polygon probability from Random Forest, scaled between 0-255  Unc_stdev  Standard deviation of the uncertainty.  npix  Number of pixels in polygon  Modal_class  RECOMMENDED FOR DISPLAY. This attribute gives the LCM2015 class as an integer code  from 1-21 (see Table 2). Note this is often referred to as the LCM2015 target class (see  Appendix 3 for standard LCM colour mapping).   Modal_prop  Proportion of polygon classified as dominant class   Composite  The number of the composite image that the classification is derived from; 99 signifies infill  from LCM2007 (see Appendix 4 for details of composite images).    Raster data sets  The raster data were derived from the vector dataset to produce a 25m raster and a series of 1km  products. Great Britain and Northern Ireland are provided in separate data sets to allow for their  different projections. Not all applications need the thematic resolution of the complete set of  LCM2015 classes, so LCM2015 has a defined set of Aggregate classes, based on merging LCM2015  classes (Table 1). The Aggregate classes are used for the 1km raster products.    25m raster   This is supplied as a 2-band raster, where band 1 is the LCM2015 classification (dominant) class per- polygon and band 2 is the mean per-polygon probability from the Random Forest classifier. The  relationship between the band 1 pixel value and corresponding LCM2015 class is shown in Table 1,  with detail on the extent of the data set and other metadata in Table 3. 12    1km raster  The 1km products for LCM2015 were created by summarising the LCM2015 25m raster data set to  produce percentage cover for each class and to identify the dominant (most widespread) class in  each 1km pixel (Table 3). The products at 1km are:  -  Dominant cover at 1km for LCM2015 classes (1-band)  -  Dominant cover at 1km for LCM2015 Aggregate classes (1-band)  -  Percentage cover at 1km for LCM2015 classes (21 bands)  -  Percentage cover at 1km for LCM2015 Aggregate classes (10 bands)    For the percentage cover products, integer values are reported, so the rounding of each value  means that in some cases the sum of all the layers may be slightly above or below 100. Around the  coast the values will be sum to less than 100 reflecting the proportion of mapped area in the 1km  square. One 1km x 1km pixel covers the area of 1600 25m pixels, consequently, a land cover type  has to cover more than sixteen  25m-pixels to exceed 1% of the 1km pixel area and hence have a  percentage cover value in the 1km percentage cover data sets.

Citing LCM2015 (DOI’s)  All LCM2015 products have individual DOI’s, so you can cite the data in the same way that you cite  other sources of information, such as journal articles. Citing the DOI’s enables methods to be clear  and repeatability, as well as enabling better understanding of the levels of usage of different  LCM2015 products, DOI’s are also increasingly required by scientific journals. The DOI’s are given for  Great Britain (Table 4) and for Northern Ireland (Table 5).    When using the DOI in publications please include the author(s) and date within the text and the full  DOI citation in the references section.

Comment on classes as mapped in LCM2015   (see also Appendix 2 for a summary of JNCC Broad Habitat definitions)  LCM2015 class  Brief Review  Broadleaved  woodland  Broadleaved woodlands are characterised by stands >5 m high with tree  cover >20%; scrub (<5 m) requires cover >30% for inclusion in this BH. Such  fine distinctions cannot be made through remote sensing. Open-canopy  woodland (stands with trees <50%) is a particular problem, albeit occurring  relatively rarely, and may not often be mapped consistently, due to the  dominance of the non-woodland plants. Stands with near-closed canopies  can be interpreted easily in the field and pure examples can normally be  found for training the classifier. Broadleaved evergreen trees (part of this  BH) rarely occur in stands >1ha (an area large enough to create suitable  training areas appropriate for classification).   Mixed woodland (see differences from LCM2007 section). Where individual  stands of broad-leaved or evergreen trees exceeded the minimum  mappable unit, they were treated as separate blocks within the woodland;  in many parts of the UK, truly ‘mixed woodlands’ as opposed to those with  mosaic-blocks of broadleaved and coniferous trees, are unusual.   ‘Coniferous  Woodland’  ‘Coniferous Woodland’ includes semi-natural stands and plantations, with  cover >20%. The recognition of coniferous woodland is generally  straightforward. Rare examples of open canopy semi-natural pinewoods  may have been classified according to the dominant understorey class. The  BH includes new plantation and recently felled areas (this is a class where  the BH definition is based on land use, i.e. forestry, rather than cover). New  plantations, predominantly heather and/or grass, for example, are  recorded as such by the spectral classification of image data. New  plantations are only consistently recorded as conifers when tree cover is  sufficient to strongly influence the reflectance. LCM2015 includes newly  felled areas. Once they are fully recolonised by rough grass, heath or scrub,  they are recorded according to that cover. Deciduous larch is discernible  from other deciduous trees and is generally correctly included with other  conifers.  ‘Arable  and  Horticulture’  This Broad Habitat includes annual crops, perennial crops such as berries  and orchards and freshly ploughed land. Orchards with a ground flora are  hard to distinguish.   ‘Improved  Grassland’                  Improved grassland is distinguished from semi-natural grasslands based on  its higher productivity, lack of winter senescence and location and/or  context. In some cases heavy grazing can cause mis-classification with,  arable land or semi-natural grassland.    Some confusion occurs between ‘Improved Grassland’ and ‘Calcareous  Grassland’ and ‘Neutral Grassland’, as ‘Calcareous Grassland’ and ‘Neutral  Grassland’ are often very productive grassland and so spectrally very  similar to ‘Improved Grassland’. 16    ‘Neutral  Grassland’    For LCM2015 ‘Neutral Grassland’ is mapped spectrally, however, the  inclusion of ancillary layers for slope and distance to rivers is expected to  improve the classification of ‘Neutral Grassland’ on flood plains. Areas  identified as ‘Neutral Grassland’ by LCM should probably be treated as  having the potential to be ‘Neutral grassland’ as for a conclusive  classification field survey is required to make a determination based on  botanical composition. ‘Neutral Grassland’ also includes semi-improved  grasslands managed for silage, hay or pasture (Jackson, 2000), which in  LCM2015 will often be classified as ‘Improved Grassland’.  ‘Calcareous  Grassland’    For LCM2015 ‘Calcareous Grassland’ is mapped spectrally, however, the  inclusion of ancillary layers for slope is expected to improve the  classification of ‘Calcareous Grassland’ in some cases. Areas identified as  ‘Calcareous Grassland’ by LCM should probably be treated as having the  potential to be ‘Calcareous Grassland’ as for a conclusive classification field  survey is required to make a determination based on botanical  composition.   ‘Acid Grassland’ For LCM2015, ‘Acid Grassland’ is mapped spectrally.    Bracken can be mapped using LCM2015 methods, but it depends on image  timing and suitable training areas (bracken often fails to offer stands  sufficiently extensive for classification and training), so for consistency it is  assigned to ‘Acid Grassland’. However, some stands of bracken can be  identified at the subclass level.  Note  about  grassland  classes  The comparisons between previous LCM data and other data sets (for  example the ground reference polygons and Countryside Survey in 2007  Broad Habitat maps) (Morton et al., 2011), have shown that ‘Neutral  Grassland’ and ‘Calcareous Grassland’ were often mis-classified as  ‘Improved Grassland’. Some users may wish to aggregate the grassland  classes together, if this is appropriate for their needs.  ‘Heather’  and  ‘Heather  grassland’     (together form  the  ‘Dwarf  Shrub  Heath’  Broad  Habitat)  ‘Dwarf Shrub Heath’ is divided into two classes, depending on the density  of Heather, producing ‘Heather’ and ‘Heather grassland’ classes  respectively. This is similar to LCM1990's and LCM2000s Open and Dense  Shrub Heath classes.    Note: the Land Cover Maps typically show confusion over the separation of  ‘Bog’ and ‘Dwarf Shrub Heath’, however, this only affects the separation of  these two BHs and they are often difficult to separate in the field.     Note, the Broad Habitat classification treats ericaceous vegetation on peat  > 0.5 m depth as ‘Bog’.   ‘Fen, Marsh and  Swamp’  ‘Fen, Marsh and Swamp’ includes fen, fen meadows, rush pasture, swamp,  flushes and springs. From a remote sensing perspective ‘Fen, Marsh and  Swamp’ is problematic as it is can be comprised of a wide range of land  cover types and many patches of Fen are below the LCM2015 MMU. The  small size of ‘Fen, Marsh and Swamp’ patches, plus their typically mosaic  nature make it difficult to find representative areas of sufficient size to  conduct a spectral classification. Consequently, ‘Fen, Marsh and Swamp’  will be underestimated by LCM2015.  ‘Bog’  ‘Bog’ includes ericaceous, herbaceous and mossy swards in areas with a 17    peat depth > 0.5 m. ‘Bog’ forms part of an ecological continuum covering  ‘Acid Grassland’, ‘Dwarf Shrub Heath’ and some types of ‘Fen, Marsh and  Swamp’ and the separation of these habitats can be difficult, as the surface  vegetation (i.e. land cover) maybe very similar and the division rests on the  depth of peat. The division in the field can account for species presence,  plus peat depth, but for LCM2015 the division is based on the spectral data  and presumably also the slope data.   Saltwater  Saltwater is mapped to a limited extent around the coastline of the UK. The  extent is constrained by the extent of the digital cartography, which covers  land and tidal areas, but not sea.  Freshwater      This is based on merging two freshwater BHs (‘Standing Open Water and  Canals’ and ‘Rivers and Streams’), as they cannot be reliably separated  from each other using the methods and data used for LCM2015. In many  cases small and/or narrow water bodies fall below the MMU. Water bodies  > 0.5 ha are readily mapped, as are very wide rivers (>50 m). The main  exceptions are temporary water bodies, especially in quarries where the  water body extent differs between the two images and differs from the  associated polygon shape. Water in some quarries is strongly affected by  the minerals in the rock and can result in strange water colours that maybe  misclassified.   ‘Inland Rock’  This Broad Habitat type covers both natural and artificial exposed rock  surfaces which are >0.25ha, such as inland cliffs, caves, screes and  limestone pavements, as well as various forms of excavations and waste  tips such as quarries and quarry waste. To be classified as ‘Inland Rock’ the  rock has to be the dominant spectral signature.  ‘Urban’  and  ‘Suburban’    (together form  the  ‘Built-up  Areas  and  Gardens’ Broad  Habitat)  Within the ‘Built-up Areas and Gardens’ Broad Habitat LCM2015 recognises  two categories that can be determined reliably: ‘Urban’ and ‘Suburban’.  ‘Urban’ includes dense urban, such as town and city centres, where there is  typically little vegetation. ‘Urban’ also includes areas such as dock sides, car  parks and industrial estates. ‘Suburban’ includes suburban areas where the  spectral signature is a mix of urban and vegetation signatures.  ‘Supra-littoral  Rock’  Features that may be present in this coastal class include vertical rock,  boulders, gullies, ledges and pools. Very limited areas are mappable using  satellite remote sensing.   ‘Supra-  littoral  Sediment’  This class includes sand-dunes, which are reliably mapped in this class.  Areas of coastal sand may be confused between this class and the ‘Littoral  sediment’ class.   ‘Littoral Rock’  These classes are those in the maritime zone on a rocky coastline. They are  generally more extensive than supra-littoral rock and thus more readily  mappable from satellite images. 18    ‘Littoral  sediment’  and  ‘Saltmarsh’    (together form  the  ‘Littoral  Sediment’ Broad  Habitat)  Littoral sediment is mapped as two classes: ‘Saltmarsh’ and ‘Littoral  sediment’. Saltmarsh is a Priority Habitat and of sufficient extent and  spectral distinction to be mapped consistently. The remaining ‘Littoral  Sediment’ is mapped spectrally, although there maybe some confusion  with the ‘Supra-littoral sediment’ class. 19    Appendix 2: Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats (reproduced  from Morton et al., 2011)    This section provides a brief summary of the JNCC definitions of the Broad Habitats and is  based on Jackson (2000).    There is some duplication of material for some classes between Appendix 2 and Appendix 1,  however the intention is to provide users with the key information they require to  understand the LCM2015 classes and the Broad Habitat definitions they are based on.     Note: class numbers here are JNCC’s Broad Habitat class numbers, not LCM2015 numbers.    1. Broadleaved, Mixed and Yew Woodland  This Broad Habitat is characterised by vegetation dominated by trees >5m high when  mature, with tree cover >20%. Scrub (<5 m) requires cover >30% for inclusion in this Broad  Habitat.  It includes stands of both native and non-native broadleaved trees and yew.  Woodlands dominated by coniferous species but with >20% cover by deciduous species are  included in this category.  Areas of fen woodland dominated by species such as  willow (Salix spp.), alder (Alnus glutinosa) or birch (Betula spp.) are also included.     2. Coniferous Woodland  This Broad Habitat is characterised by vegetation dominated by trees >5m high when  mature, which forms a canopy having a cover of >20%. ‘Coniferous Woodland’ includes  semi-natural stands and plantations and includes both native and non-native coniferous  trees.     3. Boundaries and Linear Features  This Broad Habitat type covers a range of linearly arranged landscape features such as  hedgerows, lines of trees, walls, stone and earth banks, grass strips and dry ditches. These  features are not mapped by LCM2007 as they are generally too narrow to be reliably  captured from the satellite images.  It is included here as its inclusion in Countryside Survey  is relevant for the Comparison between LCM2007 and Countryside Survey in Chapter 4.    4. Arable and Horticulture  This Broad Habitat includes annual crops, perennial crops, woody crops, intensively  managed commercial orchards, commercial horticultural land (such as nurseries,  commercial vegetable plots and commercial flower growing areas), freshly-ploughed land,  annual leys, rotational set-aside and fallow.      5. Improved Grassland  ‘Improved Grassland’ is characterised by vegetation dominated by a few fast-growing  grasses such as Lolium spp., and also white clover (Trifolium repens), on fertile, neutral soils.   Improved Grasslands are typically either managed as pasture or mown regularly for silage  production or in non-agricultural contexts for recreation and amenity purposes. 20    6. Neutral Grassland  This Broad Habitat type is characterised by vegetation dominated by grasses and herbs on a  range of neutral soils usually with a pH of between 4.5 and 6.5. It includes enclosed dry hay  meadows and pastures, together with a range of grasslands which are periodically  inundated with water or permanently moist.    7. Calcareous Grassland  ‘Calcareous Grassland’ is characterised by vegetation dominated by grasses and herbs on  shallow, well-drained soils which are rich in bases (principally calcium carbonate) formed by  the weathering of chalk and other types of limestone or base-rich rock. Soil pH tends to be  high (>6) although it may be as low as 5.    8. Acid Grassland  ‘Acid Grassland’ is characterised by vegetation dominated by grasses and herbs on a range  of lime-deficient soils which have been derived from acidic bedrock or from superficial  deposits such as sands and gravels. Such soils usually have a low base status, with a pH of  <5.5.     9. Bracken   This Broad Habitat type covers areas dominated by a continuous canopy cover of bracken  (Pteridium aquilinum) at the height of the growing season. It does not include areas with  scattered patches of bracken or areas of bracken which are >0.25 ha which are included in  the Broad Habitat type with which they are associated.     10. Dwarf Shrub Heath  ‘Dwarf Shrub Heath’ is characterised by vegetation that has >25% cover of plant species  from the heath family (ericoids) or dwarf gorse Ulex minor. It generally occurs on well- drained, nutrient-poor, acid soils.  This habitat type does not include dwarf shrub dominated  vegetation in which species characteristic of peat-forming vegetation such as cotton- grass Eriophorum spp. and peat-building sphagna are abundant, or that occurs on deep peat  (> 0.5 m) as these are included in the 'Bog' Broad Habitat type.     11. Fen, Marsh and Swamp  This habitat includes fen, flushes, springs, fen meadows, rush pasture and swamp. Fens are  peatlands which receive water and nutrients from groundwater and surface run-off, as well  as from rainfall. Flushes are associated with lateral water movement, and springs with  localised upwelling of water. Marsh is a general term usually used to imply waterlogged soil;  it is used more specifically here to refer to fen meadows and rush-pasture communities on  mineral soils and shallow peats. Swamps are characterised by tall emergent vegetation.  Reedbeds (i.e. swamps dominated by stands of common reed Phragmites australis) are also  included in this type.  Apart from rush pasture, examples of this Broad Habitat are relatively  rare.    12. Bog   This Broad Habitat type covers wetlands that support vegetation that is usually peat-forming  and which receive mineral nutrients principally from precipitation rather than ground water. 21    This is referred to as ombrotrophic (rain-fed) mire. The Bog Broad Habitat includes  ericaceous, herbaceous and mossy swards in areas with a peat depth >0.5m.    13. Standing Open Water and Canals  This Broad Habitat type includes natural systems such as lakes, meres and pools, as well as  man-made waters such as reservoirs, canals, ponds and gravel pits.    14. Rivers and Streams   The 'Rivers and Streams' Broad Habitat type covers rivers and streams from bank top to  bank top, or where there are no distinctive banks or banks are never overtopped, it includes  the extent of the mean annual flood.    15. Montane  The ‘Montane Habitats’ category includes a range of vegetation types that occur exclusively  in the montane zone such as prostrate dwarf shrub heath, snow-bed communities, sedge  and rush heaths, and moss heaths. The distinction between the sub-montane and montane  zone is often blurred and the two usually merge through a band of transitional vegetation.    16. Inland Rock  This Broad Habitat type covers both natural and artificial exposed rock surfaces which are  >0.25ha, such as inland cliffs, caves, screes and limestone pavements, as well as various  forms of excavations and waste tips such as quarries and quarry waste.    17. Built-Up Areas and Gardens  This Broad Habitat type covers urban and rural settlements, farm buildings, caravan parks  and other man-made built structures such as industrial estates, retail parks, waste and  derelict ground, urban parkland and urban transport infrastructure. It also includes  domestic gardens and allotments. This type does not include amenity grassland which  should be included in the 'Improved Grassland' category.    18. Supralittoral Rock  ‘Supralittoral Rock’ occurs above the high water mark, in areas influenced by wave splash  and sea-spray. Features that may be present include vertical rock, boulders, gullies, ledges  and pools, depending on the wave exposure of the site and its geology.    19. Supralittoral Sediment  ‘Supralittoral Sediment’ occurs above the high water mark, but in areas influenced by wave  splash and sea-spray. Includes shingle beaches, sand dunes and machair.    20. Littoral Rock  The geology and wave exposure of the shore influence the form of Littoral Rock habitats,  which can be as varied as vertical rock, shore platforms, boulder shores, or rocky reefs  surrounded by areas of sediment. In general, ‘Littoral Rock’ tends to be colonised by algae in  wave-sheltered conditions, and by limpets, barnacles and mussels as wave-exposure  increases. 22      21. Littoral Sediment  Areas of ‘Littoral Sediment’ are widespread around the UK forming features such as  beaches, sand banks, and intertidal mudflats. A large proportion of this habitat occurs in  estuaries and inlets where it can cover extensive areas. Saltmarsh is included within this  Broad Habitat.    22.

SS17c_sed_pigments SS1b_sed_pigments SS85_sed_pigments SS1590_sed_pigments SS906_sed_pigments SS901_sed_pigments  Overview of the data The dataset consists of chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments measured in sediment cores from six lakes in the Kangerlussuaq area of West Greenland which were sampled during the summer of 2017.  Experimental design/sampling regime/ Collection/Generation/Transformation Methods The location of each lake and sampling site is as follows:   The sediment cores were collected from the deepest part of the lakes using a HON-Kajak corer in 2017 (Prater et al 2021). Cores were sectioned into depth intervals in the field and stored refrigerated in sealed plastic bags before subsampling for pigment analysis.   Pigment samples were stored frozen until analysis. The cores were sampled to provide a long-term overview of changes in the lakes; pigments were analysed as biomarkers of photosynthetic organisms. Clay Prater was responsible for the sample collection. Suzanne McGowan and Amanda Burson were responsible for the sample analysis.   Analytical methods Sediment from each subsample was frozen, freeze-dried prior to extraction. Sediments were weighed extracted in an acetone: methanol: water (80:15:5) mixture. The extracts were left overnight at -4 ºC, filtered with a PTFE 0.2 μm filter and dried down under nitrogen gas.  A known quantity was re-dissolved into an injection solution of a 70:25:5 mixture of acetone, ion-pairing reagent (IPR; 0.75g of tetra butyl ammonium acetate and 7.7g of ammonium acetate in 100ml water) and methanol and injected into the HPLC unit.  Pigment extracts were separated in an Agilent 1200 series separation module with quaternary pump. The mobile phase consisted of Solvent A (80:20 methanol: 0.5 M ammonium acetate), solvent B (9:1 acetonitrile: water) and solvent C (ethyl acetate) with the stationary phase consisting of a Thermo Scientific ODS Hypersil column (205 x 4.6 mm; 5 µm particle size).  The separation conditions a 4 minute ramp from 100% solvent A to 100% solvent B, a 34 minute ramp to 25% solvent B and 75% solvent C followed by an isocratic hold for 5 minutes. A return to the starting conditions of 100% solvent A was conducted over 4 minutes with a 9 minute isocratic hold for re-equilibration. The separation was conducted at 1 ml min-1 and methods are a modification of Chen et al. (2001). Eluted pigments passed through a photo-diode array detector and UV-visible spectral characteristics were scanned at between 350-750 nm.  Peak areas were calibrated to commercial standards (DHI, Denmark).  Quantification was based on scanning peak areas at 435nm and calibrating to a set of commercial standards (DHI Denmark). Pigment concentrations are reported as molecular weights of pigments per unit weight (in sediments). Nature and units of recorded values Pigments were expressed as nanomole pigment/g organic matter (OM) using %loss-on-ignition at 550 °C LOI550 as a determinant of the OM fraction (Heiri et al, 2001); LOI data er given in Prater et al (2021). The HPLC was calibrated using commercial pigment standards from DHI (Denmark). Identification of pigments was based on retention times and spectral characteristics with reference to an known standard at the start and end of each run (terrestrial plant extract) to check for retention time drift.    Pigments followed standard nomenclature except in the case of Pheophytin b1 which refers to a derivative of pheophytin b. Pheophytin a1 refers to a derivative of pheophytin a refers to a derivative of pheophytin a. Chl_a refers to chlorophyll a, Chl_b refers to chlorophyll b and Chl_c2 refers to chlorophyll c2. Quality control Individual pigments for HPLC pigments were calibrated using an 8-point calibration conducted at least once per year. An extract from green plants was added at the start and end of each HPLC run to check for stability of retention times and avoid misidentifications. Each pigment identification and baseline integration was conducted manually by a trained expert to ensure efficacy of identification and auto-integration.  Details of data structure This dataset comprises six csv files entitled  SS17c_sed_pigments SS1b_sed_pigments SS85_sed_pigments SS1590_sed_pigments SS906_sed_pigments SS901_sed_pigments The first column of all csv files is the depth interval in the core from which the sample was taken.

This dramatically improves spatial and  thematic accuracy and better represents real world objects.    The GB framework is based on Ordnance Survey Master Map topography  layer (hereafter referred to as OSMM) and the NI framework is based on  cartographic data from Ordnance Survey Northern Ireland (now part of Land &  Property Services).   The spatial framework has been further refined by supplementing the  generalised national cartography with agricultural census data boundaries and  image segments.   LCM2007 is the first land cover map to provide continuous vector coverage of  UK Broad Habitats derived from satellite data.    LCM2007 contains almost 10 million land parcels (8.6 million for GB; 0.9  million for NI).   Heritage   LCM2007 is the third in the Land Cover Map (LCM) series:  o LCM1990 (originally called LCMGB) is the first GB map of land cover  produced from satellite data. It is a raster product with land cover given  as 25 bespoke target classes.  o LCM2000 is a vector land cover map of the UK based on satellite data.  Land parcels were derived from image segments.  Land cover is based  upon UK Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats.    Production   LCM2007 was produced from over seventy satellite images, which were  combined into 34 multi-date summer-winter images. The multi-date images  were based on one summer and one winter image. The summer-winter  images increase the contrast between land cover types and so increase the  accuracy of the classification.   o 91% of UK was mapped from summer-winter images (compared to  84% for LCM2000 and 87% for LCM1990)  o 9% was classified from single-date imagery (compared to 15% for  LCM2000 and 11% for LCM1990)  o 0.5% was filled manually   99.5% of parcels were classified using automated procedures.  0.5% were  classified by visual interpretation.   After initial classification, knowledge-based enhancements were applied to  increase the refinement and accuracy of the classification using soil, altitude  and urban extent data sets. 6    Quality Assurance   Field validation points were collected between 2006 and 2008. 9127 of the  field validation points were used to validate LCM2007 giving an overall  accuracy of 83% for the LCM2007 classes.   The accuracy for different land classes varies.  Comparison with Countryside Survey   LCM2007 has been assessed against a) the 591 Countryside Survey  squares, b) against the Countryside Survey estimates of Broad Habitat extent  for the UK.    The comparison of LCM2007 to the 591 1km x 1km squares surveyed by  Countryside Survey showed:  o 62% correspondence at the BH-level, 67% at the aggregate level and  76% at the associated BH-level.  o For the common Broad Habitats (defined here as those covering more  than 10,000km2 of the UK) the User‟s accuracy varies from 89% for  „Built-up Areas and Gardens‟ to 37% for „Dwarf, Shrub Heath‟.    Countryside Survey has an established methodology for calculating National  Estimates of the area of each Broad Habitat for the UK from the CS-squares.  The CS in 2007 estimates of Broad Habitat were compared to the LCM2007  areas of BH for the UK:  o The LCM classes which fall within the Countryside Survey upper and  lower 95% confidence limits for the UK are: „Coniferous Woodland‟,  Freshwater, „Built-up Areas and Gardens‟ and „Calcareous Grassland‟,  Broadleaved Woodland, „Acid Grassland‟ and „Inland Rock‟.  Summary statistics   LCM2007 shows the UK land cover as being comprised of mainly „Arable and  Horticulture‟ and „Improved Grassland‟ (25% each), with the other main land  covers being Semi-natural grassland (13%) and Mountain, Heath and Bog  (16%). Urban areas make-up 6% of the UK, as do „Coniferous Woodland‟  (6%) and Broadleaved woodland (6%), with coastal classes and  Freshwater contributing the remaining 2%.  Change mapping   Using CEH land cover products for change mapping is complex because:  o The classes used in the 1990 map differ from the two later LCMs.  o The spatial structure differs across all three LCMs.  o Classified images typically have an error of around 20%, whereas the  level of BH change is likely to be less than this in the period between  LCMs.   o Reliable methods for separating real changes from those due to error  and spatial inconsistency have not yet been established. 7    Product specification   LCM2007 maps 23 land cover classes, which combine to map 17 terrestrial  Broad Habitats.   LCM2007 maps land cover, rather than land use.   LCM2007 has a minimum mappable unit of 0.5ha.   LCM2007 has a rich metadata to enable users to track the processing steps  applied to each polygon.  LCM2007 data products   The main LCM2007 product is the vector data set, which has 10 attributes  that document the processing stages applied to the polygon, including the  polygon construction (Construct attribute), spectral classification result  (ProbList attribute) and knowledge-based enhancements (KBE attribute).   The main raster data set is a 25m product containing the 23 LCM2007 land  cover classes.    LCM2007 is also summarised as a series of 1km data products, which give  percentage cover or dominant land cover for each 1km square.

Examples include  artificial materials such as roads and buildings in urban areas, natural and managed  vegetated surfaces and inland water.  Land cover maps have multiple uses. They  are used for the management of natural resources, urban planning, carbon  accounting and flood risk modelling, to name only a few.  Land cover maps can be  obtained by ground-based surveys but for large surface areas this would be  impractical and too expensive.  To realise cost effective large-scale land cover maps,  satellite images are used. This document describes the production of the Land Cover  Map for 2007 (LCM2007).  LCM2007 is the third digital Land Cover Map produced by  CEH from satellite images. It gives land cover in relation to UK Biodiversity Action  Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats. The UK BAP is the UK Governments response to the  Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) arising from the Earth Summit in Rio 1992.   The complete UK coverage of LCM2007 complements the intensive sampling, but  restricted spatial coverage of the Countryside Survey of 2007. CS is a unique study  of the natural resources of the UK‟s countryside which involves ground-based  mapping and assessment of associated vegetation, soils and freshwaters.     Three National Land Cover Maps  The first digital land cover map for Great Britain derived from satellite imagery is the  Land Cover Map of Great Britain 1990 (LCM1990, formerly LCMGB 1990).  This is a  25m x 25m pixel land cover product describing land cover in 1990.  LCM1990 pre- dates the CBD so land cover is given as 25 bespoke target classes.  It was produced  by automated classification techniques where each pixel is assigned to a land cover  class based upon its spectral characteristics.    The Land Cover Map for 2000 (LCM2000) is the second map in the series and  includes Northern Ireland.  The production of LCM2000 used novel object based  image analysis (OBIA) techniques that had recently emerged from geographical  information science.  Instead of representing the land surface as regular sized pixels,  OBIA considers the land surface a collection of discrete irregular objects such as  forests, lakes, urban areas and fields.  Partitioning an image into objects is  analogous to the way humans conceptually organise the landscape in order to  understand it and the contextual relationships between objects assist with their  classification.  It is widely accepted that OBIA produces thematic land cover maps  with more accuracy than pixel based approaches (Gao and Mas 2008).  Land cover objects for LCM2000 were derived from image segments (see Section  3.3) and were assigned land cover values according to the pixel distributions within.   These classifications where then refined using contextual and ancillary information.   LCM2007 builds upon the successes of LCM2000 and employs similar but enhanced  classification techniques.  The principal difference between LCM2007 and LCM2000  is the source of land cover objects.  LCM2007 objects come from generalised digital  cartography, refined with image segments.  LCM2000 uses only image segments.   Deriving objects from digital cartography is advantageous.  Cartographic boundaries 9    very accurately delineate real-world land cover objects (e.g. lakes, fields,  settlements, industrial areas, semi-natural areas etc) and this improves the spatial  accuracy of LCM2007 over LCM2000.  Moreover, the accurate delineation of real- world objects helps to clarify the spectral properties of the land surface and therefore  improves thematic accuracy too.  The other major advantage that comes from using national cartography relates to re- usability and change detection.  Image segments represent a snapshot of land  surface reflectance.  Reflectance varies temporally.  A segmentation performed in  one year will therefore give a different result to the next or previous years.  The  consequence of this is that successive land cover maps based on image segments  will have very different spatial structures.  This restricts spatial and temporal  comparisons of land cover and therefore the ability to detect change.  By using  digital cartography LCM2007 overcomes this problem.  Many of the boundaries  mapped in the UK countryside come from or pre-date the enclosure acts of the  1700s and 1800s.  They are relatively static through time when compared to  changes in land use and land cover.  This relative fixation of land cover objects, the  principal units of change, makes the generalised cartography of LCM2007 re-usable.   Successive land cover maps that share a common spatial structure will make  accurate and spatially explicit change detection a realistic ambition.   Therefore in  addition to providing up-to-date information on land cover, because of its spatial  structure LCM2007 gives us a platform for future UK wide land surface mapping and  monitoring exercises.                                                  Please note: The UK component of the Corine Land Cover 2006 produced on behalf of the  European Environment Agency, has been derived from the LCM2007 vector product by a  process involving geometric generalisation and thematic transformations. 10    Chapter 2: LCM2007 Classification Scheme    Background  The UK Biodiversity Group identified a group of Broad Habitats to cover the  complete range of UK habitats, as an initial stage in the development of the UK  Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP). The Broad Habitats are described by the Joint Nature  Conservancy Committee (JNCC) (Jackson, 2000) and are used by Countryside  Survey and LCMs 2000 and 2007. LCM2007 aimed to contribute to the habitat  assessment by mapping the UKs Broad Habitats.            LCM2007 classes  LCM2007 classifies the land cover of the UK using classes based on the Broad  Habitats, with some minor differences. Table 2.1 summarises the LCM2007 classes  and notes their correspondence with the Broad Habitat classification scheme and  also with LCM2000. A summary of the Broad Habitats is given in Appendix 1.     Spectral remote sensing can be used to classify land cover, however, the  relationship between land cover and habitat is not straightforward.  Sometimes land  cover and habitat type have a direct and unique match. An example of a unique,  direct match would be a patch of coniferous trees, which would map directly to the  „Coniferous Woodland‟ Broad Habitat.  In some cases the links between land cover  and Broad Habitat are more complicated and exhibit a „one-to-many‟ relationship.  This is particularly true of grassland, which forms the „Improved Grassland‟, „Neutral  Grassland‟, „Acid Grassland‟ and „Calcareous Grassland‟ habitats plus some types of  „Bog‟ habitats. Grassland is also present, although not as the dominant land cover, in  „Built-up Areas and Gardens‟, „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟ and Saltmarsh, which falls  into the „Littoral sediment‟ category. Consequently, assigning grassland to different  habitat types is not straightforward.    In the production of LCM2007 grassland is mapped by classifying images into  „Improved Grassland‟ and Rough grassland, after which knowledge-based  enhancement (KBE) rules are applied. The knowledge-based enhancement rules  determine whether Rough grassland should be reclassified as „Neutral Grassland‟,  „Calcareous Grassland‟ or „Acid Grassland, or whether it should remain as Rough  grassland (for details about KBEs see Section 3.7). The requirement for KBEs to  separate Rough grassland into grassland Broad Habitats is important because  grassland Broad Habitats, in the field, may be determined by the presence of a few  indicator species rather than the dominant species. The determination between  grassland Broad Habitats in LCM2007 is based on soil type, as shown by soil data  sets, and consequently does not always reach the same conclusion as field survey.  The semi-natural grasslands in LCM2007 therefore differ from the strict Broad  Habitat interpretation, as they are partly based on soil data sets, rather than species  composition (this is discussed further in Chapter 4). In Table 2.1 Neutral, Acid and   A consistent formatting style will be used when referring to Broad Habitats, LCM2007 classes and  LCM2007 aggregate classes. For Broad Habitats the convention is: italics, a capital letter at the  start of words and enclose in single speech-marks e.g. „Improved Grassland‟. LCM2007 classes  are given in bold e.g. Freshwater, as are LCM2007 Aggregate classes. 11    Table 2.1. Summary of LCM2007 classes and Broad Habitat. Green shading highlights Broad  Habitats as documented by JNCC (Jackson, 2000).     Broad Habitat  LCM2007 class  Notes on LCM2007 class  „Broadleaved, Mixed  and Yew Woodland‟  Broadleaved woodland  Same as LCM2000 class. Differs from BH  due to exclusion of Yew, which is not  extensive enough for LCM to map.  „Coniferous  Woodland‟  „Coniferous Woodland‟  As BH and LCM2000  „Arable and  Horticulture‟  „Arable and Horticulture‟  As BH and LCM2000  „Improved Grassland‟  „Improved Grassland‟  As BH and LCM2000    Rough grassland  Mix of areas of managed, low productivity  grassland, plus some areas of semi-natural  grassland, which could not be assigned  Neutral, Calcareous or Acid Grassland with  confidence by the knowledge-based  enhancements.  „Neutral Grassland‟  „Neutral Grassland‟  As BH and LCM2000  „Calcareous  Grassland‟  „Calcareous Grassland‟  As BH and LCM2000  „Acid Grassland‟  Acid grassland   Acid grassland incorporates Bracken.  Bracken is a Broad Habitat under certain  circumstances (see Appendix 1). Bracken  can be mapped using LCM2007 methods, but  it depends on image timing, so for  consistency it is assigned to „Acid Grassland‟.  „Fen, Marsh and  Swamp‟  „Fen, Marsh and  Swamp‟  As BH and LCM2000  „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟  Heather  As LCM2000; spectral differences between  dense heather and heather grassland enable  separation spectrally.

Urban 12    Calcareous Grassland are identified as being „BH and LCM2007‟ as the aim is to  map to the specific grassland Broad Habitat type as far as possible.    The montane distribution for LCM2007 is assigned based on altitude (see Section  3.7), whereas the Broad Habitat definition is based on vegetation type. The Broad  Habitat definitions produced by JNCC note (Jackson, 2000) that if other habitats,  such as „Calcareous Grassland‟ and „Bog‟, occur within the „Montane Habitats‟ zone  they should not be recorded as „Montane Habitats‟. In the production of LCM2007 it  was not possible to determine whether a „Montane Habitats‟ reclassification based  on altitude has greater validity than the original spectral classification. Consequently,  in LCM2007 above the montane altitude LCM2007 maps three Broad habitats:  „Montane Habitats‟, Freshwater and „Inland Rock‟.     Steps such as the application of knowledge-based enhancements to identify the  different semi-natural grassland types and the „Montane Habitats‟ areas are  documented within the polygon attributes of the vector data set. Consequently, if a  user wishes to remove a particular knowledge-based enhancement, either to retrieve  a merged class such as Bracken, or to remove the „Montane Habitats‟ altitude-based  correction, then they can. This is because the original spectral classification  associated with each polygon remains and is documented in the ProbList attribute of  the vector data set (see Table 5.1 for more details).    There are a number of habitats where it may not be readily apparent how they are  categorised in the JNCC descriptions (Jackson, 2000), including:    Machair which is a Priority Habitat that goes into the „Supra-littoral Sediment‟  category, rather than the „Calcareous Grassland‟ Broad Habitat (Jackson,  2000, Annex 1: Table 3a http://www.jncc.gov.uk/page-2433-theme=default).   Urban despoiled land cover types, such as quarries and peat extraction, fall  into the „Inland Rock‟, rather than the „Built-up Areas and Gardens‟ Broad  Habitat, in the JNCC Broad Habitat definitions.    LCM2007 Aggregate classes  Not all applications need the thematic resolution of the complete set of LCM2007  classes, so LCM2007 has a defined set of Aggregate classes, based on merging  LCM2007 classes (Table 2.2). The Aggregate classes are used for the 1km raster  products and for data analysis and presentation in Chapters 4 and 5.    LCM2007- the new Land Cover Map  The classes described in Table 2.1 were used to classify the UK and produced the  map shown in Figure 2.1. A full overview of Land Cover Map 2007 can be seen in  Figure 2.1.  The distribution of the main Broad Habitats can be clearly identified; for  example, the arable land in the eastern part of Great Britain, improved grassland in  western England, Wales and Northern Ireland, coniferous plantations in the Scottish  Borders and the domination of the north west of Scotland with bog, heather and acid  grassland habitats.  The larger urban areas are also clearly identifiable, as are the  Montane regions in Scotland and Loch Neagh in Northern Ireland. 13    Table 2.2 Relationship between Aggregate classes, Broad Habitat and LCM2007 classes.

AWIFS, with a pixel size of 60m, was used when  other imagery was unavailable. To minimise data volume, but retain spectral  information, the red, NIR and MIR bands from the summer and winter images were  combined to create 6-band 2-date summer-winter composite images (from here on  referred to as composites, see Fuller & Parsell, 1990). Once classified the images  produce a patchwork of land cover scenes which cover the UK (Figure 3.1).        Figure 3.1. A mosaic of the classified images used to produce full UK coverage for LCM2007.  Different colours show the coverage of the different composite and single-date images (for  image details see Appendices 3 and 2). © NERC (CEH) 2011. © Contains Ordnance Survey data ©  Crown Copyright 2009.       Ideally, the entire UK would be classified using composite images, however cloud- cover and the number of image acquisitions by the relevant satellites limit the  amount of data available. For LCM2007 91% of the UK was classified using  composite images (Table 3.1), which compares with 84% for LCM2000 and 87% for 16    GB1990. Where composite images are not available summer-only or winter-only  images were used, although they typically have a reduced ability to distinguish  between habitats. Figure 3.2 shows the distribution of composite and single-date  imagery for LCM2000 (Fig. 3.2a) and LCM2007 (Fig. 3.2b). Single-date imagery was  most widely used in Scotland and Northern Ireland for both LCM2000 and LCM2007,  because cloud limited the availability of data (Fig. 3.2). The data classified for  LCM2007 cover less than three years ranging from 02/09/2005 to 18/07/2008 (see  Appendix 1 for further details) compared to over four years for LCM2000 (Fuller et  al., 2002) and GB1990 (Fuller et al., 1994).

Percentage of land classified by composite, summer-only or winter-only data for  LCM1990, LCM2000 and LCM2007 (figures for LCM1990 and LCM2000 from Fuller et al., 2002).  1 For details see „Hole-filling‟ in Section 3.6 Image Classification      Total  number  of  images  Number of  composites  Area mapped (as a % of UK area)   Composite Summer- only  Winter- only  Other  LCM1990 49  32  87% (56%  entirely  from target  year)  8%  3%  3%  unclassified  LCM2000 79  38  84% (23%  entirely  from target  year)  9%  6%  1%  filled  with  GB1990  LCM2007 73  34  91%  (6%  entirely  from target  year)  4%  5%  0.5% filled  manually1 17        Figure 3.2. Contributions of composite (combined summer and winter imagery) and single-date (summer-only or winter-only) data sets for:   a) LCM2000 and b) LCM2007. Note, GB1990 was only used for hole-filling LCM2000; gaps in LCM2007 were filled manually (for details see ‘Hole- filling’ in Section 3.6 Image Classification). 18              Figure 3.3. Timing of summer and winter images used in LCM2007 composites.    Figure 3.3 shows the timing of the winter and summer images. Winter images are  defined as those falling between October and the end of April (through to mid-May  for northern Scotland), whilst summer images are considered to be mid-May through  to late July (into August for northern Scotland) (Fuller et al., 1994). These seasonal  targets aim to capture the extremes of the phenological cycle from winter- senescence to the main growing season before harvest. For accurate classification it  is desirable to have a winter image followed by a summer image, so that the images  are from the same crop cycle.     LCM2007 is based on a target year of 2007, although other images are required.  The target year of 2007 means that the preferred combination would be winter  2006/07 images (green section of Fig. 3.3a) combined with summer 2007 images  (green section of Fig. 3.3b), but whilst a high proportion of the winter images are  from the winter of 2006/07 only a small proportion of summer images were available  for 2007 (Figure 3.3). Therefore, only three composites, covering 6% of the UK, met  the preferred winter-summer combination (Table 3.1). Thirteen other composites  were from the same crop cycle, but were not in 2007 the preferred year. However,  52% of the UK was mapped by composites including at least one image from 2007,  with a further 4% of the UK mapped from single-date images from 2007 (Figure 3.4).  Of the remaining composites, in 20 the summer image precedes the winter image,  and in the remaining four the winter image preceded the summer image by 18+   a) Timing of winter images  b) Timing of summer images 19          Figure 3.4. Areas classified using 2007 images.    months. In a very small number of cases it was necessary to manually classify small  areas of Landsat7-ETM+ data (see Hole-filling description in Section 3.6).     The sensors available for land cover mapping at the 20-30m pixel size have changed  between the production dates of the three land cover maps.  GB1990 was based  entirely on Landsat-TM, whereas LCM2000 used Landsat-ETM, Landsat-TM, and  LISS. For LCM2007 the available sensors were, in order of preference, Landsat-TM,  LISS-3, SPOT-4/5, and AWIFS. Landsat-ETM7 data were available, but due to  sensor damage in 2003, the images were not suitable for supervised classification. A  breakdown of the composites by sensor shows that the bulk of the imagery used to  produce LCM2007 is from Landsat-TM5 and LISS-3 (Table 3.2). The key advantage  of using a range of satellites is the increased likelihood of good-quality cloud-free  images. The disadvantages include slightly varying processing methods for different 20    sensors, plus the swathes of the sensors vary, so images from different sensors  generally have much less overlap than images from the same sensor.

Two CEH data sets were used, the first  being a set of ground reference points collected by CEH between 2006 and 2008  specifically for the purposes of training and validating LCM2007. The second CEH  data set was the Countryside Survey Broad Habitat areas data set, surveyed in  2007. The external data sets included national cartographic products for GB and NI,  the Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) needed for the altitude-based corrections and  various soil data sets.      CEH produced data sets - Ground reference points  A series of field trips were undertaken to collect a set of ground reference points for  the purposes of training and validating the land cover classifications. The majority of  the field trips took place in 2007, as this was the target summer for LCM2007 image  acquisitions. The ground reference points were collected using a tablet PC-based  Digital Data collection system developed for CS in 2007. The tablet was connected  to a GPS and had a bespoke GIS package which was automatically updated with the  tablet/car location, enabling users to easily record land cover at points along the field  trip routes (Figure 3.5). Data on LCM2007 land cover classes (as listed in Table 2.1)  and location were visually identified and recorded from a vehicle as it travelled along  the routes shown in Figure 3.6. Some points were recorded on foot and from view- points when vehicular access was not possible. The ground reference points were  distributed widely across the UK and routes were carefully selected to visit rarer land  cover types. 21            Figure 3.5.

Countryside Survey in 2007 data  The Countryside Survey Broad Habitat data collected by CEH in 2007 were used to  compare between CS in 2007 and LCM2007 (Chapter 4). Countryside Survey is a  unique study of the natural resources of the UK‟s countryside and has been carried  out in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1998 and 2007. Countryside Survey uses a stratified  sampling approach which samples one-kilometre squares randomly located within  different Institute of Terrestrial Ecology (ITE) Land Classes (Bunce et al., 1996). The  stratification by ITE Land Class ensures that survey squares are distributed across  all landscape types found in the UK, with each stratum having similar environmental  characteristics such as climate and geology.  In 2007 the field survey covered a total  of 591 1km sample squares spread across England, Scotland and Wales. Areas of  habitat were mapped within each square and more detailed samples were made of 23    vegetation in a series of plots. The full data set collected in Countryside Survey  enables national estimates of: the area and the change in area of habitats; the  changing condition of vegetation; the changing condition of soils, freshwaters and  ponds. However, for the purposes of comparison with LCM2007 the key aspect of  the data is the Broad Habitat map of each 1km square.    External datasets (excluding satellite imagery)  Non-CEH data sets were needed to create the spatial framework, inform the  knowledge-based enhancements (KBE) (see Section 3.7 for full details) and, in the  case of the DEM data set, as input into the raster pre-processing stages. The  external data sets used in the production of LCM2007 are summarised in Table 3.3  (the situation was complicated by slightly different products being available for the  different countries of the UK).

In total it contains over 400 million individual features.  These data  were used to produce the spatial framework for GB.      Land & Property Services (LPS) is the mapping agency for Northern Ireland. It was  formed by a merger between Ordnance Survey Northern Ireland (OSNI) and Land  Registry for Northern Ireland. LPS‟s Large-scale Vector database is a topographic  coverage of Northern Ireland comprised of over 500 individual tiles with map features  represented as points, lines and polygons.  LPS Large-scale Vector was used to  produce the spatial framework for Northern Ireland.    The OSMM and LPS (OSNI) datasets are discussed in more detail in Sections 3.3  and 3.4 respectively.    Agricultural census boundaries  Agricultural agencies in devolved governments maintain up-to-date digital maps of  agricultural land, along with woodland and marginal land on which grants or  subsidies can be claimed (Table 3.3).  These data contain boundaries that are often  too new to have been incorporated into UK inventories maintained by the OS and  LPS, or where no physical boundary exists for these agencies to map but where  fields have been subdivided for distinct agricultural use.  Incorporating these  boundaries into the framework of LCM2007 improves the delineation of land use and  therefore helps to clarify spectral properties of the land surface (see Section 3.3)  leading to more accurate land cover classification.    Urban areas  Urban area outlines for larger urban areas in England and Wales were provided by  the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The urban area and settlement boundary  dataset was created as part of the 2001 Census (ONS, 2004). For Scotland, the  Urban-Rural Classification 2003-2004 was provided by the Scottish Government. For  Northern Ireland, the Statistical Classification and Delineation of Settlements of 2005  was provided by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA).  Additionally, for Northern Ireland some urban areas were manually digitised using  satellite imagery data.      Soils  For England and Wales, Soilscapes (at 1:250,000) was provided by Cranfield  University (NSRI). The Agri-Food and Bioscience Institute provided a bespoke  Soilscape-like product for Northern Ireland (Jordan & Higgins, 2009). The soils  information for Scotland came from a bespoke product derived by the Macaulay  Land Use Research Institute (now the James Hutton Institute) from 1:250,000 soil  maps and the Land Cover of Scotland (LCS88) dataset. 25    Digital Elevation Model  NEXTMap Britain is a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for Great Britain created by  Intermap Technologies Inc. based on airborne radar data collected during 2002 and  2003.     3.3 Development of spatial frameworks: Great Britain  The spatial framework aims to delineate roughly homogenous groups of pixels  (spectral regions) and in doing so optimise the application of the maximum likelihood  classifier.  The LCM2007 spatial framework for Great Britain is based on the OS  MasterMap topography layer (OSMM). The topography layer contains over 450  million individual features representing real-world objects such as fields, roads,  buildings (polygons), overhead power lines, overhead phone lines (lines), letter  boxes, phone boxes (points) as well as intangible objects such as administrative  boundaries.   LCM2007 uses only the real-world polygon objects.  There are over  100 million real-world polygons and these give complete and continuous coverage of  Great Britain.  Minimum Mappable Unit and Minimum Feature Width  OSMM is highly detailed and accurate.  Urban areas and rural towns have been  surveyed to 1.0m accuracy against the British National Grid.  Rural areas have been  surveyed to 2.5m accuracy. Consequently, OSMM contains millions of polygons with  an extent of just a few square metres.  Contrast this with the 20m x 20m spatial  resolution of resampled satellite data used for LCM2007 (Figure 3.7).  The maximum  likelihood object-based spectral classification (Section 3.6) uses the average spectral  response within a land parcel to assign a land cover class.  A minimum of 4 whole  pixels is required to achieve a reliable spectral signature, so clearly there is far too  much detail in the OSMM.  This is especially evident in urban areas where a single  pixel may cover many real-world objects. A land parcel specification with a minimum  mappable unit (MMU) of 0.5ha and minimum feature width (MFW) of 20m was  specified for LCM2007.  This is considered the maximum spatial resolution of land  cover that can be achieved from 20m x 20m pixel satellite data.    Generalisation of OS MasterMap topography layer    Spatial generalisation is a process in which unnecessary detail is removed but  relevant detail is retained.  OSMM was generalised to satisfy the MMU and MFW  required for LCM2007.  The generalisation involved a series of iterative steps each  simplifying the spatial structure by selectively splitting and merging polygons. This  process terminated when the rate of simplification relative to the cost of further  processing diminished beyond a critical value.  Because of the huge volume of data  the generalisation of OSMM was computationally intense and required bespoke  software written for a 200 node computer-cluster.  The density of polygons was  reduced to less than 6% of the original. 26          Figure 3.7. OS MasterMap topography layer spatial structure against 20m x 20m satellite data.  © NERC (CEH) 2011. © Crown Copyright 2007, Ordnance Survey Licence Number 100017572.         Splitting and Merging     Splitting and merging represents the core of the spatial generalisation. To support  splitting and merging polygons were colour coded according to geometric complexity  (Figure 3.8).  Red polygons are too small (less than the MMU); cyan are too small  and too narrow (smaller than the MMU and narrower than the MFW); blue satisfy the  parcel criteria for LCM2007 but are elongated; yellow satisfy parcel criteria but have  complex boundaries; green polygons represent the ideal, they are broad and have  simple boundaries. The objective of the spatial generalisation is to maximise the  number of green polygons and eliminate all red and cyan polygons.  Blue and yellow  polygons are acceptable but are simplified when possible.  The splitting process begins by buffering inwards by 10m.  This removes the narrow  features of a polygon.  Buffering out from this simplified polygon by 20m creates a  „cookie-cutter‟, which is used to split the original (Figure 3.9a).  The resultant pieces  are then reclassified as red, cyan, yellow, blue or green (Figure 3.9b) ready for  merging.  Polygons that are too small or too thin are merged with their most  appropriate neighbour (Figure 3.9c). 27      Figure 3.8.  Colour classification of polygons based on area and perimeter relationships.  A is  the area, P is the perimeter.  Ar is the reduced area.  Reduced area is obtained by buffering  inwards by  .            Figure 3.9. Splitting and merging sequence.

A merge step (c) merges the fragments and simplifies  the spatial structure. © NERC (CEH) 2011. Crown Copyright 2007. Ordnance Survey Licence  number 100017572.      An objective when merging is to minimise the spectral heterogeneity in merged  parcels.  For example, it would be inappropriate to merge an urban parcel with an  adjacent lake.  The two objects will be spectrally distinct and mixed parcels classify  poorly.  To guide the merging process therefore attribute data associated to the  OSMM land parcels was used. The descriptiveGroup attribute assigns a land parcel  object to one of 21 groups; for example Path, Building, Natural Environment, and so  forth.  The descriptiveTerm refines this; for example descriptiveGroup = Natural  Environment, descriptiveTerm = Rough Grassland.  The make attribute specifies  whether a feature is man-made or natural.  Using this attribute information a concept  of spectral similarity was derived.   When merging, polygons were merged with those  most likely to have similar spectral characteristics.      A/P2 Area Ar Threshold A/P2 : area / perimeter  squared Ar : reduced area 28    A typical result of OSMM generalisation is given in Figure 3.10a and 3.10b.  Figure  3.10a shows the detail rich OSMM.  The generalised result in Figure 3.10b has  retained the salient features of the OSMM, but narrow and small features (such as  narrow roads, streams, tracks and farmsteads) that violate the MMU and MFW have  been removed.

Integration of agricultural boundaries  Generalised OSMM works very well in urban areas where changes in land cover are  invariably separated by some form of boundary mapped by OS.  In the agricultural  landscape the situation is sometimes less clear cut.  Pasture farming requires that  boundaries are stock proof and OSMM works well here.  It works less well in  extensively arable areas, where land cover boundaries are frequently missing.  The  missing boundaries generally relate to different farming practices being applied to  different parts of the same field where no physical boundary exists for the OS to  map.    To receive grants from government schemes UK farmers are required to map and  submit land parcels outlining the extent of different agricultural land use.  These data  are maintained by government agencies (Table 3.3) and were used for the second  stage of the spatial framework construction.  The data resolve many of the missing  boundary issues encountered in agricultural landscapes and were merged with the  OSMM spatial framework (Figure 3.10c).  This increases the number of objects in  the spatial framework (Table 3.4).  The extra objects account for some of the  variability not picked up by the OSMM and in doing so help to improve classification  results. 29    Integration of Image Segments  Within a field there may be spatial differences in fertility due to the effects of shading,  aspect, flooding, slope or uneven application of fertilizer leading to spectral variability  within a crop.  In semi-natural areas, for example in upland areas above land  enclosed for arable or pasture the heterogeneity of semi-natural vegetation will lead  to spectrally distinct regions than have not been mapped by the OS.  In these cases  the spatial framework derived from OSMM and agricultural boundary data is  insufficient to distinguish spectral regions.  Image segmentation refers to the partitioning of a digital image into multiple  segments.  A label is assigned to every pixel in an image such that pixels with the  same label share certain visual characteristics.  Clusters of pixels with the same  label identify relatively homogenous areas, image segments.  Image segments were  derived from satellite images (see Section 3.5).  The third and final stage of the  spatial framework construction involved the integration of these segments with the  land parcels derived from OSMM and agricultural boundary data.  The increase in  parcel density from this integration is given in Table 3.4.  Contrasting Figure 3.10c  with 3.10d gives a typical result of this third stage; clearly the segmentation has  delineated spectral regions not picked up by OSMM and agricultural boundary data.

LPS‟s Large-scale Vector digital database is a representation of  topographic and cartographic map features comprising lines, points and polygons.   The polygon coverage is restricted and represents a small percentage of Northern  Ireland's land surface.  It was therefore necessary to create a polygon coverage from  the LPS‟s Large-scale Vector line work.  The polygonisation process retains all lines  that enclose an area and dangling lines are discarded.  The enclosed areas become  the polygons.  Figure 3.11a shows a sample of the original LPS line work and Figure  3.11b the resulting polygon coverage.       Figure 3.11. Production of a polygon coverage for Northern Ireland.

(b)  A polygon coverage created from (a); note that lines not enclosing an area have  been removed. © NERC (CEH) 2011. © Crown Copyright 2011, Licence Number 100,427. 31    Polygons created from the LPS line work have no attribution to support the merging  process.  The possible consequence is a higher proportion of inappropriate merges  which could lead to mixed parcels and therefore poor classifications.  In practice  however it was found that the subsequent inclusion of lines from image segments  resolved the majority of problems of this kind.  Figure 3.12 shows the LPS Large- scale Vector (a) and generalised LPS Large-scale Vector before (b) and after (c) the  inclusion of image segments.      Figure 3.12.

Agricultural boundary data was not integrated into the NI spatial framework because  preliminary work concluded that the effort to do so was disproportionate to the  potential spatial refinement benefit.  Agricultural datasets are most useful in intensive  arable areas where multi-crops are grown within a single large field. Arable  production in Northern Ireland is less extensive and intensive than many areas of the  UK mainland and field sizes are generally smaller. The exclusion therefore did not  have a detrimental effect on classification as spectral mixing within land parcels was  well resolved by the inclusion of image segments. In other respects the construction  of the spatial framework for Northern Ireland is analogous to that used for Great  Britain.  Table 3.5 shows the size frequency of polygons at key stages of the spatial  framework production.    Generalisation of polygons derived from the LPS Large-scale Vector gave a  reduction to approximately 10% of the original polygon density.  This is a smaller  reduction than was achieved for Great Britain (~6%).  The most likely explanation is  that Northern Ireland has proportionally less urbanisation than Great Britain and it is  in urban areas where the reduction in polygon density from generalisation is 32    greatest.  In dense urban areas generalisation typically achieves reductions to  around 1 to 2% of the original density.      Table 3.5.

Selection of raster images  The key criteria for selecting images were the suitability of the sensor (20-30m pixel  resolution, plus red, NIR and MIR bands) and appropriate acquisition time. The  images used to produce LCM2007 come from Landsat-TM5, LISS-3 and SPOT4/5,  with 60m AWIFS data as a backup as described in Section 3.1. 101 images were  selected and pre-processed, of these 6 were rejected at some point during  processing. Failure was mainly due to contamination by haze and/or cloud, or  problems geocorrecting images that had been poorly orthorectified. Not all the  images processed were used, as some images were superseded by more  appropriate images of the same area. Table 1 of Appendix 2 contains details of all  the images processed. 33        Figure 3.13. Flowchart showing the key stages in the image processing of LCM2007.     Pre-processing of image data  The purpose of image pre-processing is to maximise the spatial and spectral  accuracy of the data set. Good pre-processing is a pre-requisite for accurate  classification and for multiple image-based, multi-sensor mapping it must be robust  and repeatable (Franklin & Wulder, 2002). The pre-processing steps carried out for  LCM2007 are similar to those carried out for LCM2000 (Fuller et al., 2002) and to  those used in other large-scale land cover mapping (Franklin & Wulder, 2002). The  pre-processing flow line for LCM2007 was:   Import data   Apply cloud and cloud-shadow masking   Atmospheric correction   Geo-registration   Topographic correction   Creation of composite images 34    To ensure consistency a handbook (Bradley et al., 2009) was created to define the  pre-processing methods and these were followed by all staff involved in the pre- processing stage. A log was kept for each image documenting the image quality and  image specific parameters ensuring traceability and repeatability.  Pre-processing began by importing the data, after which the cloud and cloud-shadow  masking was conducted via three stages: firstly, identification of the clouds;  secondly, identification of the cloud-shadow; and thirdly by masking the affected  areas. Identification of the cloud was conducted by one of four methods (sometimes  applied in combination):   Identifying cloud reflectance on a scatterplot   Thresholding based on reflectance   Thresholding based on band ratio   Manual digitisation  The first three methods require a threshold to be defined, which is then used to  create a mask, whilst the fourth method requires the user to digitise round the areas  of cloud (and cloud-shadow). The primary method for masking cloud-shadow was by  modelling the expected shadow areas, based on the cloud-mask, illumination  geometry and shadow-offsets in the x- and y- direction for each image. The cloud- shadow masking worked well when the clouds were of relatively uniform height  across the image, but sometimes needed supplementing with manual masking if  cloud height varied. A small number of images were deemed to have „failed‟ at this  stage as the masking showed that the cloud/haze problems were worse than  originally suspected.    Atmospheric correction was applied in ENVI using the FLAASH atmospheric  correction function, which is based on MODTRAN. The images were converted from  digital number to radiance using sensor-specific conversion factors, after which  FLAASH was run, producing atmospherically corrected reflectance.     Most of the images were supplied geo-referenced, but due to multiple image  suppliers and sensors the geometric reliability varied, so all images were geo- registered to either existing images (typically geo-registered images from LCM2000)  or to OS data. The aim was to achieve a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of < 0.3  pixels. Several images failed at this processing stage, possibly due to poor  orthorectification before supply to CEH.    Topographic correction is the process of adjusting the reflectance of an image to  take into account variations in slope angle and aspect, so that the same land cover  on the north and south slopes of a hill will look similar. The topographic correction  code was the same as LCM2000, but ported into an ENVI_IDL compatible format  (Bradley et al., 2009). The topographic correction code uses the Minneart model,  with the calculation of K means, to correct the radiance values. It used slope, aspect  and shaded relief, calculated from NEXTMap Britain and the NI DEM, to correct the  reflectance for topography. There were problems with the correction in winter  images, with very low sun angles and significant topography, and this resulted in  black patches (very low data values) on the north side of hills and mountains. In 35    many cases this could be avoided by taking alternative images i.e. composite 26  (c26) was taken in preference to composite 4 (c04), which covered the same area of  the Lake District, as c26 had a higher winter sun angle producing less topographic  shadow. However, in some cases manual editing was required to correct the  classification in areas of topographic shadow.    Segmentation  All 60 composite images were segmented, using the method developed for  LCM2000.  Segmentation results were combined to create a segment-based vector  framework for the UK. For full details of the segmentation method see Appendix V of  Fuller et al., (2002). The segments were created using 3-band images typically  bands 5, 3 and 1 (winter NIR, summer MIR and summer red). The segmentation  routine was limited to three input bands, so winter NIR was chosen as the brightest  winter band, with red and MIR from the summer for the remaining two bands. In this  way, the three wavebands and two dates of the composite are represented in the  input to the segmentation. The segmentation, using the same method as LCM2000  (Fuller et al., 2002), involved three stages:   Application of an edge detector to locate edges in the raster data.   Segmentation based on seed points located away from edges.   Post-segmentation generalisation, including dissolving small polygons to  produce an acceptable product.  The segmented framework was integrated with the generalised digital cartography  from OSMM and LPS Large-scale Vector (Section 3.3 and 3.4). For NI segments  from single-date images were used to supplement the segments derived from  composite images.    3.6 Image classification  LCM2007 is a parcel-based supervised maximum likelihood classification of the UK  predominantly based on medium resolution (20-30m) satellite data.  It was produced  by classifying 37 composite images and 21 single-date images according to Broad  Habitat-based classes (Table 2.1). Supervised classification uses a training data set  of observed spectral signatures and known land cover to determine the land cover of  unknown parcels. Training areas for the classification were chosen based on the  ground reference points collected during the field trips (Section 3.2). Training  polygons were selected on the basis, of a) being identified by ground reference  points and b) polygon suitability for use as a reference polygon for spectral  classification. For areas and/or habitats poorly represented by ground reference  points OS maps and web-based mapping services were consulted.    Once the training areas had been selected, they were reviewed and similar spectral  signatures corresponding to the same land cover type were grouped into spectral  classes after which the classification was run (see Fuller et al., 2002 for additional  details). The classification used a maximum likelihood classifier (an automated  process) that assigns class probability based on probability contours around the  training areas (Allaby & Allaby, 1999). In LCM2007 the probabilities of the top five  spectral classes (i.e. those that matched the observed spectral signature for the  polygon most closely) were recorded. The process of classification is iterative, with 36    each classification being reviewed and re-classified until the accuracy reaches the  required level, or until the classification can no longer be improved. The review stage  would typically identify classes which were not being classified well enough, so  additional training areas would be identified and/or the grouping of the spectral  classes would be modified, after which the classification would be re-run.     In practice, for one of the more widespread Broad Habitats in a medium sized  satellite scene there may be between 5 and 15 spectral training classes, each of  which might have up to 15 training polygons. For a heavily arable area more than 30  classes may be needed to capture the spectral signatures of all the fields. These  figures vary dramatically between images depending on the Broad Habitats within  the scene and the range of spectral variability within the Broad Habitats. In some  polygons there is a mix of more than one habitat – this is particularly true for the  more semi-natural, less managed areas and in these cases the aim is to identify the  most widespread Broad Habitat.    Apply manual edits  Sometimes it was necessary to manually edit the classification. These edits typically  occurred when a rare land cover class was located in an image. Trying to classify the  rare class sometimes creates uncertainty with other classes and unsatisfactory  mapping. An example, of this might be a quarry, which is classed as urban despoiled  and sits in the „Inland Bare‟ Broad Habitat. Attempting to classify based purely on  spectral signature might lead to confusion with urban land cover, which falls into the  „Built-up Areas and Gardens‟ Broad Habitat. Some winter images with problems due  to the topographic correction needed manual correction. The decision on class for a  manually classified polygon was informed by a variety of sources, including the  satellite images (or overlapping images), OS maps and web-based map services.    Hole-filling  Landsat7-ETM+ data were used to manually classify small areas of some ETM+  scenes, when no other imagery was available. This avoided the need to fill holes  using LCM2000 data. 12 ETM+ images spanning 22/01/2006 - 30/05/2009 were  processed and available for manual classification (see Table 3 of Appendix 2).  Manual classification was conducted by overlaying the spatial framework on the  raster data and manually selecting all the polygons of each Broad Habitat. It was a  pragmatic solution given the problems with ETM+, plus the lack of other suitable data  in an appropriate timeframe.    3.7 Knowledge-based enhancements     Knowledge-based enhancements (KBEs) resolve spectral confusion and/or increase  the thematic resolution of land cover using contextual and ancillary information.   They comprise regionally adaptive rules that reassign land parcels to a more  appropriate land cover class and therefore enhance the accuracy of LCM2007.   KBE‟s modified approximately 20% of LCM2007 land parcels. 37    Spectral confusion  LCM2007 land parcels are classified using red, near and mid infra-red spectral  bands. These bands offer the best discriminatory power for vegetated surfaces  (Fuller and Parsell, 1990). Spectral confusion occurs when different surface types  have similar reflectance properties.  For example, an arable field that has been  recently ploughed has little or no chlorophyll to absorb red light and will appear bright  in this band.  Likewise so will a road, a car park, an open-cast quarry, a sandy or  shingle beach, and a limestone pavement. If these surfaces have similar reflectance  qualities for mid and near infra red light it becomes very difficult to distinguish  between them using reflectance alone. Using image composites from different  stages in the growing season (Section 3.6) can help to resolve some of this  confusion. For example, if an arable land parcel in a winter scene displays a  ploughed field and the summer scene displays crops, the composite information will  be sufficient to distinguish this parcel from those that are permanently non- vegetated. However, if the summer scene occurs after harvest when the vegetation  has been removed the composite information may be of little or no help.  The above gives just one example of a common spectral confusion encountered in  the production of LCM2007, but spectral confusion occurs between many land cover  types.  To detect spectral confusion we examine a land parcel against a knowledge  base comprised from contextual and ancillary data.  If confusion is suspected  knowledge-based enhancement rules (KBE rules) are used to assign a revised land  cover class.  Taking the arable example further, suppose we detect a land parcel  that has been classified as urban, it is shaped like a field, is surrounded by arable  fields and exists far from known urban boundaries.  It is quite likely that this is an  arable field that has been misclassified because at the time of image capture it had a  similar reflectance to nearby urban parcels.  A KBE rule should therefore pick this up  and reassign it to an arable class.  Of course there is always the risk of the „false- positive‟.  The land parcel may be an out of town industrial area or an open-cast  quarry, in which case the reassignment to arable would be inappropriate.   In fact it is  inevitable that some reassignments are wrong, but the purpose of the KBEs is to „get  it right‟ most of the time and thereby improve the overall accuracy of the product.  To  minimise reassignment errors we suppress KBEs in regions where we expect they  will be inappropriate.  We also include manual inspections and corrections (Section  3.6).    Thematic resolution    KBEs are also used to enhance thematic resolution.  LCM2007 aims to provide land  cover as target classes related to Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats  (Table 2.1).  However, the information that can be gleaned from optical satellites is  frequently insufficient for this. Put simply, some Broad Habitats cannot be  determined from optical imagery.  UK BAP grassland habitats offer a good example.   The UK BAP specifies four grassland Broad Habitats: „Acid Grassland‟, „Calcareous  Grassland‟, „Improved Grassland‟ and „Neutral Grassland‟. Acid, Calcareous and  Neutral grasslands are considered semi-natural and are characterised by their  species composition.  However, these compositions do not each have a distinct  reflectance at the spatial resolutions of satellite data used for LCM2007 and cannot  be separated.  In fact, using reflectance we can only reliably distinguish improved 38    from rough grassland (relatively unimproved), and these lie on a continuum with  confusion near the middle.    At its extreme improved grassland has typically been modified by extensive fertiliser  use and reseeding.  It is chlorophyll rich all year round and contains an insignificant  amount of dead material.  This gives it a very characteristic signal.  Conversely at  any time of year rough grassland may have a significant amount of dead material  from previous seasons; this increases reflectance of the mid and near infra red  bands. There is also less chlorophyll, so less photosynthesis and more red  reflectance making it spectrally dissimilar from recently improved grassland.    Improved grassland maps directly to a single BAP Broad Habitat.   Rough grassland  does not.  BAP semi-natural grasslands will in general fall within the rough grassland  category.  However, this represents a many-to-one relationship, so to resolve rough- grassland to a BAP Broad Habitat we need additional information.  Suppose that a  land parcel has been spectrally classified as rough grassland. After examining its  relationship with the knowledge base it is found to be growing on an acid soil and at  an altitude typically beyond the limit for improved grassland and arable (the most  likely confusion classes).  Given this information it becomes highly likely that the  Broad Habitat cover is „Acid Grassland‟ and a KBE rule should reassign it.    The Knowledge Base  Ancillary data from a variety of sources was compiled and processed to form the  knowledge base.  Knowledge was grouped into four types, described below.    Urban context  We have discussed above how urban context can resolve misclassified arable.   It  can help with many other types of confusion too.  For example, a parcel classified as  Inland Bare in an urban context is more likely to be part of the dense urban fabric  and is better represented by an urban class.  Government agencies maintain readily accessible spatial datasets which outline  urban and settlement boundaries.  Boundaries for England and Wales were obtained  from the Office for National Statistics and relate to the 2001 census.  Boundaries for  Scotland were from the Scottish Executive Urban Rural Classification of 2003-2004.  Boundaries for Northern Ireland were obtained from the Northern Ireland Statistics  and Research Agency and come from the Statistical Classification and Delineation of  Settlements of 2005. Where boundaries were considered insufficient additional  urban areas were manually digitised.    Coastal proximity  Coastal proximity helps detect inappropriately labelled land parcels. For example,  Littoral Sediment encountered 40 miles from coast has certainly been confused with  another class; perhaps an urban or an arable land cover.  An outline of the UK Coastline was used to create three zones:  the coastal zone in  which coastal classes are permissible; the offshore zone in which terrestrial classes 39    are not; and the terrestrial zone in which coastal habitats cannot occur.  Because of  the UK's variable coastal topography these zones were defined per satellite scene.    Terrain  Terrain information has many uses.  For example coastal classes will not be found at  altitude. Parcels with a very steep gradient are unlikely to be „Arable or Improved  Grassland‟ if the gradient is too steep for agricultural machinery.  Urban land cover is  very rare in the montane zone.    Terrain for Great Britain was derived from the NEXTMap Britain Digital Elevation  Model.  For Northern Ireland the terrain model created for LCM2000 was used.  For  each parcel we recorded altitude, slope and aspect.    Soil Type  Soil type is a key arbiter of land cover type, especially when combined with other  contextual information.  For example, Rough grassland or Heather grassland on a  bog soil on a shallow slope is quite likely to be Bog.  Grassland at low altitude in the  tidal flooding zone on a saltmarsh soil is quite likely to be Saltmarsh.  Soil information for the UK is maintained by distinct bodies. For England and Wales  we used the National Soil Resources Institute (NSRI) Soilscapes product. For  Scotland we used a bespoke dataset provided the Macaulay Land Use Research  Institute (now James Hutton Institute) which combined soil series with land cover  information from the Land Cover of Scotland (LCS88) product. The Agri-Food and  Bioscience Institute (AFBI) of Northern Ireland provided a bespoke product with soil  information given in the NSRI Soilscapes schema.   Soil data from these agencies were generalised into the following soil types: Acid,  Bog, Calcareous, Fen, Neutral, Saltmarsh, Sand dune, Water, and Other. This level  of detail was sufficient for KBEs and casting all the products into the same 'currency'  made the development of general rules and algorithms more straightforward.    KBE Algorithms  Seven automated KBE algorithms were developed.  The algorithms examine a  parcel's context relative to the knowledge base and then apply KBE rules.  KBE  algorithms were applied in sequence with the results of each stage being the start  point for the next.  This sequential application optimises the integration of  knowledge.   A land parcel may go through a sequence of reassignments, ideally  each time converging towards the „truth‟.  For example, „Littoral Sediment‟ found too  far from the coast may change to „Inland Rock‟ but then a subsequent algorithm  determines that the parcel exists within an urban boundary so it then becomes „Built- up Areas and Gardens‟.  Records of the application of KBE algorithms are  maintained against each parcel and are supplied with the LCM2007 vector product  (Section 4.3).   Full details of the algorithms are beyond the scope of this text but an overview of  each is given below.  The order in which the algorithms are described represents the 40    order in which they were applied to classification scenes.  After the first pass an  additional run of the Terrain and Soil algorithms was applied to capture any  remaining assignment errors.  The general operation sequence of a KBE algorithm  is:   examine a land parcel against context,    if its classification is considered inappropriate, inspect the five most likely land  cover classes from the maximum likelihood classification result.   If a suitable alternative is found within this list assign this land cover, else  apply a specialised sequence of rules to  assign a more realistic land cover.    Terrain algorithm  The terrain algorithm is straightforward but quickly picks up a lot of classification  irregularities.  It takes account of a land parcel‟s slope and altitude to assign a more  appropriate class.  For example, it assigns land cover at high altitudes (>800m for  southern UK (south of Birmingham) and >600m for Northern UK) to „Montane  Habitats‟. „Arable and Horticulture‟ parcels on very steep slopes would also be  assigned to a more appropriate land cover, as would coastal classes at high altitude.  Soil algorithm  The soil algorithm is more complex. It integrates soil type with urban context, terrain  and coastal proximity to refine or improve the thematic resolution of land cover.    This algorithm is essential for separating „Acid Grassland‟, „Calcareous Grassland‟,  and „Neutral Grassland‟ from Rough grassland.  It is also helps with the  classification of „Bog‟ and Saltmarsh, which are often unreliably, resolved using  spectral data alone.  Terrestrial zone algorithm  Coastal habitats cannot occur in the terrestrial zone.  Any parcels that have been  classified as a coastal habitat that have not been resolved by the terrain algorithm  are reassigned by this algorithm to a more appropriate class.    Offshore algorithm  This algorithm picks up classes that are not possible offshore.  For example,  grassland or arable parcels located offshore are highly likely to be wrong.   Saltmarsh or „Littoral Sediment‟ are assigned as more likely alternatives.  Within urban boundary algorithm  This algorithm is applied to all parcels that lie within the urban boundary.  It resolves  common spectral confusions that occur with urban sealed surfaces.  For example,  urban parcels can have a similar spectral response to areas of naturally exposed  bare rock, littoral sediments, and in some cases arable.   In reassigning a new land  cover class the algorithm will also take account of the parcel‟s immediate  neighbourhood and geometric properties to obtain the most likely alternative.  Outside urban boundary algorithm  This algorithm is the converse of the above.  It checks for parcels assigned to an  urban class that lie outside the urban boundary.  The urban areas and settlement  boundaries frequently do not cover the smaller villages, hamlets and isolated  farmsteads that occur throughout the wider countryside.  These structures obviously  fall within the BAP „Built-up Areas and Gardens‟ Broad Habitat and so to simply  reassign all urban parcels that occur outside of the urban context would be wrong. 41    Distinguishing misclassified urban from true urban is tricky.  Local context and  geometric properties are key.  For example, small urban parcels (<1ha) with irregular  boundaries adjacent to objects with similar qualities quite possibly are small  settlements or farmsteads, so are ignored.  Large urban parcels shaped like fields,  surrounded arable fields are highly likely to be misclassified arable.   Water  This algorithm improves the thematic resolution of water.  Water absorbs much of  the red and infra red spectra and appears dark, except where it is particularly  shallow or turbid, and is easily distinguished from the surrounding landscape.   However, there is no spectral distinction between coastal and inland water.  When a  water parcel occurs in the offshore zone it is labelled as Sea water (Ws).  When it  interacts with the coastal zone or occurs inland the shape of the land parcel is used  to categorise it.  If it is elongate and coastal then it is labelled as estuarine (We) and  if it is elongate then it is labelled as a river (Wr), otherwise it is labelled as a lake  (Wl).     3.8 Assembling full UK coverage   LCM2007 is the first UK land cover map to be produced as a continuous vector  product.  Due to differences in spatial reference systems it is maintained as two  spatial databases: one for GB and one for NI.  LCM2000 like LCM2007 gives a  complete UK vector coverage but it is not continuous.  LCM2000 was produced as  discrete 100km x 100km tiles.  Image segmentation and classifications were  performed on a per tile basis.  As a consequence of this spatial and thematic  inconsistencies occur at boundaries where tiles meet.  In order to produce a  continuous single layer coverage that exceeds the extent of an individual tile, users  have to apply complex merging processes.  By providing a continuous coverage  LCM2007 overcomes this problem.    Producing a continuous coverage from the many composite and single-date  classifications requires a strategy for dealing with overlapping regions and assigning  priority to the best classifications. This was achieved by splitting the UK into nine  relatively independent chunks (Figure 12, Appendix 3). The chunks were chosen to  maximise the natural divisions in the data and the diagonal boundaries reflect the  swathes of the satellite data. After the chunks had been defined, the priority of each  classification was determined based on the quality of the final classification, with the  best classifications having the highest priorities. Table 6 shows the final order of  images according to chunk, with arrows showing how images that fall into two or  more chunks are catered for. Chunks 6 and 7 are merged in Table 6, because of the  high degree of overlap between them. In general, the composites produced the best  classifications, but in some cases single-date hole-filling scenes produced better  classifications than overlapping composites. This was because the single-date hole- filling images typically covered small areas with a limited range of both spectral and  Broad Habitat variation, which minimises the opportunity for spectral confusion  between classes resulting in a better classification. 42    Table 3.6. Order of priority for classifications across the 9 chunks. Note images beginning with  ‘C’ are composite images, whilst those beginning with ‘I’ are single-date images (see  Appendices 2 and 3 for further details).

This section presents a  validation of LCM2007 by assessing it against the ground reference data set  collected during the field trips. The aim of the comparison is to assess the accuracy  of LCM2007. The results are displayed in a correspondence matrix which is a table  used to compare two classifications. The correspondence matrix shows where  LCM2007 and the ground reference data set correspond and diverge.      Validation of LCM2007 with ground reference data  Selected ground reference points (Section 3.2) were used to validate the  classification, both during the classification stage (in conjunction with visual checks)  (Section 3.2), and after the final LCM2007 data set was created. This section reports  the results of the comparison between the 9127 LCM2007 ground reference  polygons and the final LCM2007 product (Table 3.7).     The field trip points were used to identify suitable training areas for the classification  (i.e. a training data set), and also to identify suitable points for a ground reference  data set against which to validate the product (i.e. a testing data set). The training  and testing data set are separate groups of ground reference points. The accuracy of  LCM2007 is defined by comparison against the ground reference (testing) data set.  In some cases ground reference points and polygons were poorly aligned and in  other cases the ground reference points were only appropriate for part of the polygon  - this mainly occurred in natural or semi-natural areas, although it did affect some  woodlands and fields. Ground reference points were only assigned as validation  points if the person conducting the classification was confident that the ground  reference point was appropriate for the polygon. This excludes polygons with mixed  Broad Habitats (shown by multiple ground reference points within a single-polygon)  or where ground reference points fell in adjacent polygons. Once a ground reference  point has been accepted as appropriate, for a polygon in the LCM2007 project  database, the polygon becomes a ground reference polygon.     Results  The correspondence, between LCM2007 and the 9127 ground reference polygons  (Table 3.7), shows that the overall accuracy of LCM2007 is 83%. Information about  the classification of individual classes is also given in the correspondence matrix  (Table 3.7).     Table 3.7 is a correspondence matrix and is data rich, but due to the number of  classes in LCM2007 it is not straightforward to interpret. Using „Bog‟ as an example,  the Producer‟s accuracy (see glossary) quantifies how well areas mapped as „Bog‟ in  LCM2007 match the ground reference polygons. Table 3.7 shows „Bog‟ is 93%  accurate against the ground reference polygons. The User‟s accuracy (see glossary)  gives the probability of a parcel of a given class being correctly classified. In the case  of „Improved Grassland‟, the User‟s accuracy is 83% and the Producer‟s accuracy is  89%. Therefore, based on the User‟s accuracy of 83%, there is a 0.83 probability  that a parcel classified as „Improved Grassland‟ will be correctly classified. The  Producer‟s accuracy quantifies how well areas mapped as „Improved Grassland‟ in 44    LCM2007 match the ground reference polygons. The User‟s and Producer‟s  accuracy can vary independently of each other, although accurate classes will have  high values for both the User‟s and Producer‟s accuracies.      The LCM2007 classes are grouped below based on the User‟s and Producer‟s  accuracy. Note that requiring both accuracy values to be above a threshold means  that the classes are grouped by the lowest of their two accuracy values, so the  location of „Bog‟ is determined by the User‟s accuracy (39%), rather than the  Producer‟s accuracy (93%).   > 90% for User’s accuracy and Producer’s accuracy:   „Coniferous Woodland‟   „Arable and Horticulture‟   ‘Littoral Rock‟   > 80% for User’s accuracy and Producer’s accuracy   Broadleaf woodland   „Improved Grassland‟   Littoral Sediment   Urban   Suburban   Saltmarsh   Freshwater   ‘Supra-littoral Rock‟   > 70% for User’s accuracy and Producer’s accuracy   „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟   Heather   „Supra-littoral Sediment‟   > 60% for User’s accuracy and Producer’s accuracy   Saltwater   > 50% for User’s accuracy and Producer’s accuracy    „Calcareous Grassland‟   Heather grassland  < 50% for User’s accuracy and Producer’s accuracy   Rough grassland   „Acid Grassland‟   „Neutral Grassland‟   „Bog‟   „Montane Habitats‟    Accuracy is class-specific, with classes using external data sets for knowledge- based enhancements tending to have the lowest accuracy. The problem with  „Calcareous Grassland‟ and „Neutral Grassland‟ is largely due to spectral confusion  with „Improved Grassland‟ and Rough grassland. The confusion with Rough  grassland is partly due to differences between what it is possible to discern in the  field and what can be achieved by spectral classification, KBEs and a soil data set.  The „Montane Habitats‟ designation is expected to be correct for areas mapped as  „Montane Habitats‟, but may underestimate in some areas, especially NW Scotland.    In some cases it may be useful for user‟s to apply their own bespoke validation,  especially where extensive work is planned based on a county or smaller subset of  data (see Appendix 4). 45    Table 3.7.

Producer‟s accuracy = percentage of ground reference polygons classified correctly. User‟s accuracy = probability (expressed as a percentage) of a  polygon of a particular class being correctly classified. 46    Chapter 4: Comparison with Countryside  Survey in 2007    4.1 Introduction  This chapter presents the results of a comparison of LCM2007 with Countryside  Survey (CS) in 2007. The aim is to establish confidence in LCM2007 and quantify  the correspondence between the LCM2007 and CS by comparing LCM2007 with:   The 591 Countryside Survey 1x1km squares in Great Britain   The Countryside Survey estimates of Broad Habitat area for England, Wales,  Scotland, Northern Ireland and the UK  The first method produces a correspondence matrix. The second method produces a  table showing the LCM2007 estimates of Broad Habitat area with the Broad Habitat  estimates of area and confidence limits from the CS in 2007.     4.2 Comparison with Countryside Survey squares  Countryside Survey in 2007 surveyed 591 1x1km squares recording Broad Habitat  cover, plus more detailed information (Carey et al., 2008). The LCM2007 and  Countryside Survey data sets are very different and to increase compatibility  between the two, Countryside Survey polygons below the LCM2007 MMU width and  area were excluded, as were the Countryside Survey Mosaic and „Boundary and  Linear Features‟ classes, as there is no LCM2007 equivalent. Note, the Countryside  Survey Mosaic class is used when the field surveyors encounter a mix of Broad  Habitat types where it is not possible to map discrete areas of a single habitat  exceeding the CS MMU. The field surveyors do record proportions of the Broad  Habitats comprising the Mosaic polygons, but it would not be straightforward to  include them in this analysis, so this class was excluded. Other differences, between  CS in 2007 and LCM2007, such as LCM2007 mapping „Standing Open Water and  Canals‟ and „Rivers and Streams‟ as a composite Freshwater class, were accounted  for when the correspondence matrix was created. Equivalent data for Northern  Ireland were not available to include in this analysis.    An area-based comparison was conducted between the 591 Countryside Survey  squares and the corresponding areas of LCM2007. The correspondence was  calculated by comparing the polygons in CS with the same area in LCM2007 and  recording the area of Broad Habitat. This was conducted for each square in turn,  enabling the correspondence for each square to be calculated, and the squares were  then aggregated to enable production of correspondence tables for the: UK,  England, Scotland and Wales.     Whilst every effort is taken to ensure the accuracy of CS data there are errors, due  to habitat definition issues, as well as individual surveyor‟s interpretations. As a  result the comparison between LCM2007 and CS in 2007 is about discerning  correspondence and divergence, rather than accuracy. In addition, the timing of field 47    survey and image acquisition may not coincide, allowing changes to occur in the  intervening period. Given that Countryside Survey is about 81% repeatable (Norton  et al., 2009) and that LCM2007 aims for an accuracy of > 80% at the Broad Habitat  level, then combining these two accuracy levels suggests a likely correspondence of  about 65% (80% x 81% = 65%). However, this does not take into account the  different spatial structures of the two products, which although much closer than they  used to be, still differ.  This will have a tendency to reduce areal correspondence  values.    The correspondences are reported for the UK, plus England, Scotland and Wales,  and are calculated for a range of thematic levels:  -  The Broad Habitats common to LCM2007 and CS in 2007.  -  Aggregate class level (Aggregate classes are defined in Table 2.2,  Chapter 2).  -  Broad Habitat Association (BHA) level.  Broad Habitat Association (BHA)  The Broad Habitat Association concept provides an additional measure of thematic  correspondence, which has some similarities to the Aggregate class thematic level,  but is more targeted. A key factor underlying the Broad Habitat Association (BHA)  concept is that the land cover maps provide land cover, which may relate uniquely to  one Broad Habitat or may have a one-to-many relationship with several Broad  Habitats. For example, deciduous woodland uniquely maps to the „Broadleaved,  Mixed and Yew Woodland‟ Broad Habitat, whereas rough grassland has a one-to- many relationship with habitat, and may be „Acid Grassland‟, „Calcareous  Grassland‟, „Neutral Grassland‟, poor quality  „Improved Grassland‟  or even in some  cases „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟ or „Bog‟. These distinctions can be difficult to make  from remote sensing and even in the field; they are especially difficult when they  occur as mosaics where the dominant (most widespread) land cover may vary  depending upon the polygon boundaries.     In this type of situation the identification of „associated‟ habitats which form different  Broad Habitats, as defined by Jackson (2000), is useful. The cross-habitat links in  Table 4.1 formalises some of the uncertainties between mapping land cover and  assigning it to a habitat-based classification [see Appendix 5 for further details]. The  similarity of land cover for different BH is most pronounced for grassland and semi- natural upland areas, where mosaic landscapes maybe poorly represented spatially  by the scale of the parcel-based structure in LCM2007, so these habitats dominate  Table 4.1. In practice this means that as well as squares down the main diagonal of  the correspondence matrix being accepted as corresponding directly, some  additional cells are considered as corresponding directly. For clarity the cells used to  calculate the BHA correspondence are shaded orange in Tables 4.3 & 4.5-4.7.              Broad Habitat Association (BHA): BHA identifies prescribed habitat links (Table  4.1) which form allowable correspondence between CS and LCM2007 classes e.g.  „Bog‟ is acceptable for „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟ at the BHA-level.     The purpose of using BHAs is to separate correspondences which are slightly  different e.g. „Bog‟ and „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟, compared to those that are very  different e.g. „Montane Habitats‟ and „Arable and Horticulture‟. 48    Table 4.1. Summary of correspondences allowed for Broad Habitat Association (whether due  to transitional habitats, mosaic habitats, limitations of KBE’s or difference in interpretation  between Countryside Survey field survey and LCM).    LCM  CS Field Survey  „Bog‟  „Montane Habitats‟  „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟  „Acid Grassland‟  „Montane Habitats‟  „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟  „Acid Grassland‟  „Bog‟  „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟  „Acid Grassland‟  Rough grassland  „Acid Grassland‟  „Calcareous Grassland‟  „Neutral Grassland‟  „Improved Grassland‟  „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟  „Bog‟  Water  „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟  Acid grassland  Broadleaved woodland  Rough grassland  Any grassland  „Built-up Areas and  Gardens‟  Any water  „Built-up Areas and  Gardens‟  Any water  Any water  Saltwater  „Littoral Rock‟  „Littoral Sediment‟    Interpretation of correspondence values  Comparing spatial datasets with disparate spatial resolutions and thematic  specifications is not straightforward and careful interpretation is required.  Figure 4.1  shows three CS squares, with correspondence from 50% to 90%. The figure clearly  demonstrates the differences in the level of detail between the Countryside Survey,  with a MMU of 0.04ha, and LCM2007, with a MMU of 0.5ha. Spatial differences are  particularly evident in Figure 4.1a where small and narrow objects, representing  clumps of trees, roads and rivers have been removed by the generalisation of  OSMM.  There is also displacement and simplification of boundaries where narrow  and small features have been „absorbed‟ into their surroundings.    Figure 4.1a shows field survey and LCM squares with a direct correspondence of  50%, which sounds low, but it would be wrong to interpret this as a 50% error.  Instead, as Figure 4.1a shows the Countryside Survey and LCM2007 squares look  quite similar. Both versions of the square are predominantly a mix of „Improved  Grassland‟, Broadleaved woodland and „Neutral Grassland‟ with the main  differences being the extra spatial detail in the field survey square and the  distribution of grassland types. The 50% example also shows two „Fen, Marsh and  Swamp‟ polygons near the top of the CS square, which in LCM2007 are covered by 49    a single polygon that extends further to the west and is classified as „Broadleaf,  Mixed and Yew Woodland‟.     The level of spatial complexity (basically the number of polygons) is highest in the  lowest correspondence square (Fig. 4.1). The simpler spatial structure of the 70%  and 90% correspondence squares produces a better spatial match between the two.     Figure 4.2 shows the same areas as Figure 4.1, but with a single grassland class  incorporating Acid, Neutral, Calcareous, Rough and „Improved grassland‟. The  correspondence between the Countryside Survey and LCM2007 data has been  updated to reflect the single grassland class. When all grassland is combined into a  single class the correspondence for square a) increases from 50% (Fig. 4.1a) to 87%  (Fig. 4.2a). Fig. 4.2a shows the mix of grassland and woodland between the two  squares is similar, with some of the remaining differences being due to the spatial  heterogeneity of the landscape. Therefore, for some uses better results may be  achieved by grouping all grassland into a single grassland class.    Table 4.2. Degree of correspondence between CS in 2007 and LCM2007 for Broad Habitat,  Broad Habitat Association, and Broad Habitats with a single-grassland class.      Correspondence between CS2007 and LCM2007  Square  (in Figs. 5.1 and 5.2)  Broad Habitat  correspondence  (%)  Broad Habitat  Association  correspondence (%)  BH with single  grassland class  correspondence (%)  a  50  75  87  b  70  79  85  c  90  92  90    Correspondence matrices   Correspondence matrices can be summarised by giving the Producers accuracy and  the Users accuracy. The Producer‟s accuracy (the percentage values in the bottom  two rows of Tables 4.3 & 4.5-4.7) show how well the CS in 2007 Broad Habitats are  classified by LCM2007. The User‟s accuracy (the percentage values in the last two  columns of Tables 4.3 & 4.5-4.7) shows the probability that an LCM2007 polygon of  a particular class is likely to be that on the ground, based on the comparison with  CS2007. The user‟s and Producer‟s accuracies are important tools for understanding  the correspondence matrix and their respective roles are best illustrated by example.  Table 4.3 shows that the Producer‟s correspondence between CS in 2007 and  LCM2007 is 90% for „Arable and Horticulture‟, whereas the User‟s correspondence  between LCM2007 and CS in 2007 for „Arable and Horticulture‟ is 73%. What this  means is that 90% of the CS squares mapped as „Arable and Horticulture‟ are also  mapped as „Arable and Horticulture‟ in LCM2007; whereas 73% of the land mapped  as „Arable and Horticulture‟ in LCM2007 corresponds with „Arable and Horticulture‟ in  the CS dataset.  The differences are subtle but important.  It might help to imagine a  simplified situation where the whole of the land surface has been mapped as „Arable  and Horticulture‟, when in reality „Arable and Horticulture‟ covers say 10% of the land  surface.  In this instance Producer accuracy would be 100%, since the whole area  known to be „Arable and Horticulture‟ has been mapped as „Arable and Horticulture‟.  This looks encouraging until you consider the User accuracy of only 10%.  This low 50    value implies that 90 % of the land has been incorrectly mapped.  Clearly Producer  and User accuracy should be considered together, and by doing so map users gain  insight into the varying reliabilities of different land cover classes.  The 73% User  accuracy for LCM2007 „Arable and Horticulture‟ assessed against CS in 2007  implies that LCM2007 estimates for the extent of „Arable and Horticulture‟ will be  around 27% greater than those coming from CS 2007.  And in fact LCM2007 does  produce an approximately 30% higher national estimate for „Arable and Horticulture‟  than CS in 2007 (this point is discussed further in Section 4.3).    The comparison between the Countryside Survey in 2007 squares for Great Britain  and LCM2007 show an overall correspondence of 62% at the Broad Habitat level  (Table 4.3), 67% at the aggregate level (Table 4.4) and 76% at the associated BH- level (Table 4.3). For the common Broad Habitats (defined here as those covering  more than 10,000km2 of the UK (based on CS values in Table 4.9)), the Producer‟s  accuracy ranges from 16% („Neutral Grassland‟) to 90% („Arable and Horticulture‟).  The User‟s accuracy, also for the common Broad Habitats, varies from 37% („Dwarf  Shrub Heath‟) to 89% („Built-up Areas and Gardens‟). The results presented in this  section focus on the Producer‟s correspondence. The issues which would be raised  by the User‟s accuracy are covered in Section 4.3, which focuses on the extent of  Broad Habitat from both LCM2007 and CS in 2007.     The BHA are the same as the BH-level for some classes, but for many of the upland  classes the correspondence is higher, for example, „Bog‟ goes from 37% at the BH- level to 96% at the BHA-level, as much of the difference between CS in 2007 and  LCM2007 was due to the separation of „Bog‟, „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟ and „Acid  Grassland‟.     The correspondence of Countryside Survey „Littoral Rock‟ with LCM2007 is 0% in  both the BH-level and BHA-level, as LCM2007 has the areas mapped as „Littoral  Sediment‟ and „Supra-littoral Sediment‟. This confusion is mainly between the  coastal classes, so the Aggregate class correspondence for the coastal classes is  higher at 66% (Table 4.4). Reducing the thematic resolution to Aggregate class level  produces a range of correspondence from 35% for semi-natural grassland, through  to 90% for „Arable and Horticulture‟ and 91% for Freshwater (Table 4.4).    Fig. 4.1 illustrates three of the main differences, between the field survey and  LCM2007, as shown by Table 4.3, specifically:   The higher proportion of „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟ in CS in 2007  compared to LCM2007 (Fig. 4.1a).   The mismatch between recording of „Neutral Grassland‟ and „Improved  Grassland‟ between the two data sets (Fig. 4.1a and b).   Differences in the uplands based on the distribution of „Bog‟, „Acid  Grassland‟ and „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟ (Fig. 4.1c). 51        Figure 4.1.

Green squares correspond at Aggregate class level. (Units are ha).        4.2.1 Assessment by class  Broadleaved woodland - the correspondence matrix (Table 4.3) shows that  LCM2007 and Countryside Survey in 2007 have a 64% correspondence for  broadleaved woodland, with the primary sources of divergence being:   LCM2007 recording areas as Broadleaved woodland, whilst Countryside  Survey records them as „Coniferous Woodland‟ (205ha).  This may in part be  due to mixed woodland (see definition, Appendix 1, as determining the mix  between deciduous and coniferous, and hence whether the area falls into the  „Broadleaved Woodland‟ or „Coniferous Woodland‟ category, is subject to  surveyor interpretation. Deciduous larch forests may also be having an  impact, as spectrally they look more similar to deciduous broadleaved  woodland than coniferous woodland.    LCM2007 records some areas as „Improved Grassland‟, whilst Countryside  Survey records them as „Broadleaved Woodland‟ (194ha). This may be due to  differences separating the point at which improved grassland with trees  becomes woodland, as the transition between the two is based on accurate  assessment of percentage tree cover. The differences in polygon structure  between the data sets may also affect whether tree cover is great enough to  count as woodland.  ‘Coniferous Woodland’ - the correspondence between Countryside Survey in  2007 and LCM2007, at 83%, is very high. However, Countryside Survey „Coniferous  Woodland‟ does correspond to LCM2007 Broadleaved woodland and „Dwarf Shrub  Heath‟ in some cases. The correspondence with „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟ is likely to be 55    partly spectral confusion, but also recently felled stands, or recently replanted  stands, where much of the spectral response is due to heather and grass around the  young trees. Rides between woodland stands and open patches are also often „Acid  Grassland‟ or „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟ dominated and maybe having an influence here.    „Arable and Horticulture’ - the correspondence is 90% (8643ha correspond  directly). The main divergence between the two data sets for „Arable and  Horticulture‟ is with „Improved Grassland‟, although it is minor. Countryside Survey in  2007 recorded 1944 ha of LCM2007 arable as „Improved Grassland‟ and LCM2007  recorded 654ha of Countryside Survey in 2007 arable as „Improved Grassland‟. This  may reflect differences in interpretation between the two data sets, with CS recording  agricultural ley as „Arable‟, whereas in the fallow/pasture period LCM would record it  as „Improved Grassland‟.    „Improved Grassland’ - the correspondence between the two data sets is 70%  at the Broad Habitat level, and 77% at the Broad Habitat Association level, which  accepts that some low productivity, improved grassland is contained within the  LCM2007 Rough grassland class. The main mis-match between Countryside  Survey in 2007 recorded „Improved Grassland‟ is the 1944 ha which LCM2007  records as „Arable and Horticulture‟.  This difference may relate to:   Rotation farming where the survey year differed between the two data sets.    Misclassification in images where recently mown hay may have been  indistinguishable from arable.    Misclassification in images/composites using a spring, rather than summer  image, where the spectral separability between arable and improved  grassland was at a minimum.    Heavily grazed land may appear spectrally to resemble arable more than  improved grassland.    Differences in the spatial structure between the two data sets.  „Neutral Grassland’ - the correspondence between the two data sets is 16%.  The low correspondence demonstrates the difficulty of identifying this habitat reliably  from satellite data. In the field it is determined on botanical composition and it also  includes semi-improved grasslands managed for silage, hay or pasture (Jackson,  2000), which in LCM2007 will often be classified as „Improved Grassland‟. This is  illustrated by the correspondence (Table 4.3) which shows that 56% of the 4371ha of  „Neutral Grassland‟ recorded by Countryside Survey is classified by LCM2007 as  „Improved Grassland‟ (2478ha), with the rest as a mix of mainly „Arable and  Horticulture‟ and „Acid Grassland‟.     „Calcareous Grassland’ - Countryside Survey in 2007 recorded 102ha of  „Calcareous Grassland‟ of which LCM2007 recorded 1ha, however, LCM2007  recorded 29ha of Rough grassland but the KBE (Section 3.7) was not able to  convert this with confidence to „Calcareous Grassland‟. 28ha of „Calcareous  Grassland‟ was classified as „Improved Grassland‟ as spectrally they are often very  similar. The 28ha of Countryside Survey „Calcareous Grassland‟, which LCM2007  has recorded as „Supralittoral Sediment‟ are probably all Machair grasslands.  Machair grassland is a Priority Habitat, which sits under the „Supralittoral Sediment‟ 56    habitat (Jackson, 2000), though it may have the species composition of a  „Calcareous Grassland‟.    „Acid Grassland’ - Countryside Survey in 2007 „Acid Grassland‟ shows 45%  correspondence with LCM2007 at the Broad Habitat level rising to 87% if adjacent  habitats (highlighted orange in Table 4.3), such as „Dwarf Shrub Heath„, „Bog‟,  „Montane Habitats‟ and Rough grassland are taken into account. This shows that  there is strong agreement between the two data sets over the general type of  habitat, in this case upland. The differences are in the assessment of whether  grassland or heather dominated, or if the peat is thick enough to classify as „Bog‟.  These difficulties and resultant differences are to be expected in upland  environments where habitats form complex mosaics.    ‘Fen, Marsh and Swamp’ - Countryside Survey records 479ha of „Fen, Marsh  and Swamp‟ across the field survey sites, compared to 1ha recorded by LCM2007  (equivalent to 0%). Taking into account BHA increases the correspondence to 48%,  with the other main mismatches being with „Improved Grassland‟, „Dwarf Shrub  Heath‟ and „Bog‟. From a remote sensing perspective „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟ is  problematic as it is can be comprised of a wide range of land cover types and many  patches of Fen are below the LCM2007 MMU. The small size of „Fen, Marsh and  Swamp‟ patches, plus their typically mosaic nature make it difficult to find  representative areas, of sufficient size, to conduct a spectral classification. Soil data  is of limited use in assisting as it shows the historical land cover, so large swathes of  East Anglia have a peaty, fen soil, but subsequent drainage and management have  changed them to arable. Rush-pastures are not an issue as in Countryside Survey  2007 a special point was made of not recording them as „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟  after problems in earlier surveys.     ‘Dwarf Shrub Heath’ - Very similar result to „Acid Grassland‟, with  correspondence between the two data sets 54% at the Broad Habitat level,  increasing to 93% when associated habitats are considered.    ‘Bog’ - Similar to „Acid Grassland‟ and „Dwarf, Shrub Heath‟, with Broad Habitat  correspondence of 37% and BHA correspondence of 96%.      ‘Montane Habitats’ - The areas of „Montane Habitats‟ mapped by the two  surveys have a 76% correspondence at the Broad Habitat level, increasing to 100%  at the BHA-level.    ‘Inland Rock’ - the correspondence between Countryside Survey in 2007 and  LCM2007 „Inland Rock‟ is 21% at the Broad Habitat-level. Most of the difference  between Countryside Survey and LCM2007 is split between the „Acid Grassland‟ and  „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟ classes, which suggest that the mismatch is happening in  upland areas. This is probably due to differences in the proportion of rock required  before the area is classified as „Inland Rock‟ and differences in the structure of the  spatial frameworks.    ‘Saltwater’ - the correspondence at the Broad Habitat level for Saltwater is 30%,  but once littoral coastal classes are included to account for tidal state and 57    freshwater, then the correspondence reaches 95% at the Broad Habitat Association  level.    ‘Freshwater’ - 91% correspondence at the Broad Habitat level.    ‘Supra-littoral Rock’ - 15% correspondence at the Broad Habitat level,  although some of the divergence is because of 9ha which LCM2007 has classified  as „Littoral Rock‟. The other main source of divergence is 15ha that LCM2007 has as  Rough grassland and Countryside Survey has as „Supra-littoral Rock‟, a preliminary  review of some of these areas suggests that they are typically sloping areas at the  top of cliffs, with a mix of rock and rough grassland.    ‘Littoral Rock’ - Countryside Survey identifies 1ha of „Littoral Rock‟ which  LCM2007 maps as „Littoral Sediment‟.    ‘Littoral Sediment’ – ‘Littoral Sediment‟ has a correspondence of 55%  between the two data sets and primarily gets confused with „Supra-littoral Sediment‟.    ‘Built-up Areas and Gardens’ - at the Broad Habitat level there is a 50%  correspondence, however the way Countryside Survey and LCM2007 map urban  areas is different. Countryside Survey counts parcels within the urban boundary as  urban and assigns attributes to give more specific land cover information, whereas  LCM2007 maps based on land cover rather than context. This is important because  woodland, water and grassland within the Countryside Survey urban boundary may  be mapped as urban rather than woodland or water or grassland, as LCM2007  would map it.    4.2.2 Country-level results  The country-specific results (Tables 4.5-4.7) are largely a function of the accuracy in  the GB correspondence table combined with the area of the Broad Habitats in the  different GB countries. Hence, Scotland has the most „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟ and „Bog‟,  both of which show low correspondence at the BH-level, but higher at the BHA-level,  so this is reflected in the Scotland country-level results of 55.6% (Table 4.8) and  80.6% at the BH and BHA-level respectively. The more intensively managed nature  of England underlies the relatively small percentage change from 67% and 75% at  the BH and BHA-levels. The correspondence between the 107 Welsh CS-squares  and LCM2007 is 58.2% at the BH-level, so higher than the equivalent Scottish value  of 55.6%, but produces the lowest BHA value at 72.3% (Table 4.6).  This occurs  because the most common Broad Habitats in Wales, based on the extent recorded  in the CS-squares (sum of columns in Table 4.7), are „Arable and Horticulture‟ and  „Neutral Grassland‟ which are not affected by the BHA. In contrast, the equivalent  two classes for Scotland are „Bog‟ and „Improved Grassland‟ (Table 4.6), both of  which increase in correspondence when the BHA links are considered. 58          Table 4.5.

Green squares correspond at BH-level; orange squares correspond at BHA-level.

It also shows the total area  compared and the maximum potential area (number of 1km-squares * 100 (number  of hectares per square)). The percentage of total area compared (calculated from the  maximum potential area and actual area compared) varies as not all 1km-squares  are completely recorded by CS, because:   The square extends beyond the coast - sea is excluded.   Access was not granted to some areas of the squares (affects 1459 ha).   Habitat was recorded by CS as „Mosaic‟, so was excluded from this analysis  (affects 891 ha).   Habitat was recorded as „Boundary and Linear Features‟, so was excluded  from this analysis (affects 68 ha).  The lowest percentage of CS data used in the comparison is for Scotland, with 63%,  probably as the CS „Mosaic‟ class is used most often in the uplands (Figure 4.3b).  Figure 4.3 also shows that areas classified by LCM2007 as „Improved Grassland‟  dominate the „No Access‟ areas. Whether the systematic exclusion of „No Access‟  and „Mosaic‟ areas produces any systematic biases in correspondence is not clear.    Table 4.8. Summary of the number of squares, potential area and actual area in the  comparison between the CS squares and LCM2007, plus the different levels of  correspondence.

Figure 4.4 shows that the correspondence is lower in semi- natural/upland areas where the spatial structure may vary more between the  products and where classes such as „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟ and „Bog‟ may be difficult  to separate. Allowing some flexibility in the correspondences using the BHA rules  (Table 4.1) creates fewer low correspondences and increases the modal class from  51-60% (Broad Habitat correspondence (Fig. 4.4b)) to  91-100% (Broad Habitat  Association correspondence (Fig. 4.5b)). Preliminary analysis of some of the low  correspondence areas suggests that some of the problems are due to grassland  mismatch, in particular, LCM mapping areas as „Improved Grassland‟ and  Countryside Survey mapping areas as other grassland types, however, this will not  be the explanation in all cases and would benefit from further analysis. 62        Figure 4.3. Piechart showing proportions of LCM2007 Aggregate classes for the polygons  categorised by CS as either a) No access or b) Mosaic.    4.3 Extent of Broad Habitats  The Countryside Survey has an established method for calculating National  Estimates of the area of each of the Broad Habitats from the field survey data types.  LCM2007 provides a very different method of estimating these same Broad Habitat  extents, based on extensive mapping of the UK. The comparison in Section 4.1 with  the Countryside Survey squares was based on a very specific spatial comparison of  the LCM2007 and Countryside Survey products. This comparison is based on area  estimates for the UK but does not have a spatial component beyond the reporting of  areas at country-level. Tables 4.8 and 4.9 show the Countryside Survey estimates,  plus 95% confidence limits, and the LCM2007 estimates for the UK and constituent  countries. The results are presented below in three categories depending on the  degree to which the LCM2007 estimates fall within the Countryside Survey upper  and lower certainty limits.    4.3.1 Very similar area estimates   Very similar results are defined as: classes falling within the CS upper and lower  95% confidence limits in every country (Table 4.8).    Very similar area estimates occur for: „Coniferous Woodland‟, Freshwater, „Built-up  Areas and Gardens‟ and „Calcareous Grassland‟ (Table 4.8).    The „Coniferous Woodland‟ result is to be expected as the correspondence analysis  showed strong agreement between the Countryside Survey and LCM2007 data sets,  however, „Calcareous Grassland‟ is more unexpected, as it was one of the classes 63        Figure 4.4.

This discrepancy  highlights the different nature of the correspondence matrix analysis, based on the  field survey squares, and this analysis using the estimates of Broad Habitat cover for  the UK and constituent countries.  In the case of „Calcareous Grassland‟ the answer  may be that LCM2007 mapped the largest areas of „Calcareous Grassland‟ across  the UK, such as Salisbury Plain and the South Downs well, so the overall estimate  coincides with the Countryside Survey estimate.    4.3.2 Similar area estimates  Similar results are defined as: classes falling within the CS upper and lower 95%  confidence limits for the UK (Table 4.9).    Similar area estimates occur for: Broadleaved woodland, „Acid Grassland‟ and  „Inland Rock‟ (Table 4.9).    4.3.2 Dissimilar area estimates  Dissimilar results are defined as: classes falling beyond the CS upper and lower 95%  confidence limits for the UK (Table 4.9).    Dissimilar area estimates occur for: „Arable and Horticulture‟, „Improved Grassland‟,  „Neutral Grassland‟, „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟, „Bog‟, „Montane Habitats‟ and coastal  habitats.    ‘Arable and Horticulture’ - the Countryside Survey estimated area at 46,574km2 is  similar to the 46,090km2 (44,400km2 of arable plus 1,690km2 of horticulture) cited in  DEFRA‟s June Survey of Agriculture and Horticulture for the UK in 2007 (DEFRA,  2011). The LCM2007 „Arable and Horticulture‟ estimate at 63,005km2 exceeds the  Countryside Survey upper limit of 51,276km2. The difference between CS and  LCM2007 is likely to be caused by a combination of the following factors:   Differences in what is classified as „Arable and Horticulture‟ by the two  methods.   Spectral confusion.   Inclusion of „Boundary and Linear Features‟ in the LCM2007 „Arable  and Horticulture‟ area.  Differences in classification of ‘Arable and Horticulture’ - The DEFRA June  Agricultural Census figures suggest that in 2007, there were:  o 44,400km2 of arable crops.  o 1,690km2 of horticultural crops.  o 11,760km2 of temporary grass.  o 5,990km2 of uncropped land.  Together this gives a figure of 63,840km2 for agricultural land, which is close to the  LCM2007 figure of 63,005km2 suggesting that part of the difference between  Countryside Survey and LCM estimates may be due to temporary grass and  uncropped land being included in the LCM „Arable and Horticulture‟ class. This is  likely to be compounded because LCM requires images from several years to 66    produce full UK coverage. One consequence is that increasing the temporal range of  images increases the number of fields changing from temporary grassland to arable  and vice-versa. A field in a summer-winter composite which is grass in one image  and arable in the other image is likely to be classified as arable, because of the  greater spectral variability of this class.      Spectral confusion - The spectral variability of the „Arable and Horticulture‟ habitat  is greater than any of the other classes, due to the wide range of crops and because  growth stages of the same crop can vary between and across images. This can  make it difficult to fully account for all the spectral variability of arable in an image,  which is necessary to produce a good classification of the arable areas. It also  means that any poorly represented spectral signatures are most likely to be  classified as arable, if the image contains substantial arable areas. This may lead to  a tendency to overestimate arable extent in some areas.    Differences in mapping of ‘Boundary and Linear Features’ - Countryside Survey  maps boundary and linear features, but many of these are below the MMU of LCM.  Consequently, in LCM boundary and linear features are incorporated into field  polygons, so an area mapped in Countryside Survey as field-boundary-field, will be  mapped in LCM as field-field. This will tend to increase the size of fields, in  comparison to Countryside Survey, and hence the area mapped as „Arable and  Horticulture‟ or „Improved Grassland‟ by LCM2007. The 5,270km2 estimated for  „Boundary and Linear Features‟ by Countryside Survey is likely to be split in LCM  across the „Arable and Horticulture‟ or „Improved Grassland‟ habitats.    ‘Improved Grassland’ and ‘Neutral Grassland’ - the LCM2007 area for „Improved  Grassland‟ is approximately 10,000km2 more than the Countryside Survey estimate,  whilst the LCM2007 estimate of „Neutral Grassland‟ area is approximately 10,000km2  less than the Countryside Survey estimate. It appears therefore that the difference is  due to how the different products deal with neutral grassland. Spectrally it looks like  „Improved Grassland‟, although in the field survey it may be apparent that the  species composition is characteristic of „Neutral Grassland‟. The soil data is of  limited use in determining whether the grassland will be have the species  composition of „Neutral Grassland‟, or whether it is „Improved Grassland‟ on a neutral  soil.     ‘Dwarf Shrub Heath’ and ‘Bog’ - Similar to the grassland case, the difference in  „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟ and „Bog‟ classes is largely due to allocation between the two  habitats. The extent of LCM2007 „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟ and „Bog‟ is 32,090km2  compared to a value of 31,931km2 for the combined lower confidence limit of  Countryside Survey „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟ and „Bog‟.    Montane and coastal habitats - are poorly represented in Countryside Survey data  (Smart et al., 2010) so it is unsurprising that the area estimates differ for these  classes.    ‘Fen, Marsh and Swamp’ - The CS in 2007 estimate of „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟  area for the UK is 4392km2, with upper and lower confidence limits of 3596km2 and  5189km2 respectively. The LCM20007 estimate is 101km2. „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟  is so different between the two surveys, because Fen is a mosaic of land cover 67    types, so areas mapped as „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟ by CS in 2007, are frequently  mapped as Rough grassland and „Acid Grassland‟ by LCM2007. The small patch  size and different spatial structure of the CS in 2007 and LCM2007 products also  contributes to differences between LCM and Countryside Survey recording of Fen  (see discussion of Fig. 4.1). The QA of „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟ (Section 3.9) is  higher than the comparison against CS in 2007, because the ground reference  polygons are designed to validate LCM2007 and hence the validation polygons  match the LCM2007 polygons spatially and the areas of „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟  are large enough to be detected by LCM2007 methods.     4.3.3 Discussion  This section has focussed on comparing LCM2007 area estimates with those  derived from Countryside Survey. It is important to note that the Countryside Survey  estimates are created by scaling-up using the ITE Land Classes. It is not clear how  much this scaling up affects the estimates; although a sensitivity analysis of the BH  area estimates to the different versions of the ITE Land Classes is currently  underway (Wood et al., in prep.). When LCM2000 data for the Countryside Survey  squares were scaled-up using the Countryside Survey method (to produce UK  estimates) the results were noticeably more similar to the Countryside Survey  estimates than the results based on the LCM2000 mapped areas (Fuller et al.,  2002).       Figure 4.6. Frequency of Fen, Marsh and Swamp polygons recorded by Countryside Survey in  2007 based on a) polygon size and b) total area of polygons for each polygon size class. The  first column in a) and b) is 0-0.49ha and as such is below the LCM2007 MMU.    One final factor to take into account is the influence of Countryside Survey parcels  below the LCM MMU, which are likely to have a significant effect on the area  recorded for some habitats, such as „Broadleaf, Mixed and Yew Woodland‟ and „Fen,  Marsh and Swamp‟ which are often characterised by small parcels within a wider  landscape dominated by other habitats. Figure 4.6 shows that most „Fen, Marsh and  Swamp‟ polygons are below the LCM2007 MMU (Fig. 4.6a) and they account for  33% of the total „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟ area. 68      The impact of Countryside Survey patch size on different habitats has not been  investigated comprehensively, but is likely to show that other habitats also occur  frequently in patch sizes, below the size of the LCM MMU. Understanding the patch  size frequency distributions would be useful in further understanding the relationship  between the LCM and CS data sets.       4.4 UK Land Cover  Summary estimates for UK Land Cover are given in Figure 4.7 (Broad Habitat values  are given in Tables 4.8 and 4.9). LCM2007 shows that for the UK more than 50% is  intensive agriculture („Arable and Horticulture‟ plus „Improved Grassland‟, 51%)) or  developed („Built-up Areas and Gardens‟ (6%)). The remainder is mainly semi- natural, with woodlands covering 12% of the UK - split evenly between Broadleaved  Woodland and Coniferous Woodland. The remaining 30% of the UK is split  between Coastal (1%), Semi-natural grassland and Mountain, heath and bog.    The land cover distribution varies dramatically across the four countries of the UK.  England has the highest proportion of intensive land use at 76% (40% „Arable and  Horticulture‟; 27% „Improved Grassland‟; 9% „Built-up Areas and Gardens‟), followed  by Northern Ireland and Wales with 64% of intensive land use („Improved Grassland‟  and „Arable and Horticulture‟ and „Built-up Areas and Gardens‟). Scotland has the  lowest proportion of intensive land-use with 36%, although it does have the largest  proportion of „Coniferous Woodland‟, which could arguably be seen as an intensive  land-use. The largest proportion of semi-natural areas are in Scotland, with 36%  Mountain, heath and bog and 20% semi-natural grassland. The proportion of  Freshwater varies widely across the four countries from 1% for Wales and England,  2% for Scotland and 4% for Northern Ireland, mainly due to Lough Neagh.    LCM2000 mapped the UK using the same Broad Habitat classes as LCM20007.  Figure 4.8 shows the proportions of land cover based on LCM2000 for the Aggregate  classes. The main differences are that LCM2007 records 26% „Arable‟ and 13%  semi-natural grassland compared to LCM2000‟s values of 23% and 17% for „Arable‟  and semi-natural grassland respectively. Coniferous woodland changes from 5.4%  to 6.1%, whilst Urban is slightly less in LCM2007 than in LCM2000 (5.9% compared  to 6.7%). How much the figures are affected by the changes to the spatial framework  is unclear and how the differences between the two products should be interpreted  requires further analysis. 69    Table 4.8. The coverage (km2) of Broad Habitats from LCM2007 compared with the Countryside Survey in 2007 estimates and the Countryside  Survey upper and lower confidence limits at 95%, for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. CS in 2007 and LCM2007 estimates are in  km2. LCM2007 estimates are highlighted: bold, where LCM2007 estimates fall within Countryside Survey upper and lower limits; red, where they exceed the  Countryside Survey upper limit and blue where they are below the Countryside Survey lower limit.    1. LCM2007 Neutral Grassland estimates include LCM2007 Rough grassland, although this assignment is not ideal as Rough grassland is known to contain a mix of 'Acid  Grassland', 'Calcareous Grassland', 'Neutral Grassland' and some 'Improved Grassland'.  2. Northern Ireland „Montane Habitats‟ is surveyed in a separate montane stratum covering 735 ha so the actual montane habitat area will always be less than this.  3. The Northern Ireland Intertidal Broad Habitats are also in a separate stratum which is analysed separately.  4. Acid Grassland & Bracken, plus the Freshwater class both have CS in 2007 areas and 95% confidence limits derived by adding the BH confidence limits, rather than the  bootstrapping method used to create the BH confidence limits. 70    Table 4.9.

The  first comparison was based on the BH mapped in the Countryside Survey 1km  squares and LCM2007, whilst the second was the comparison between Countryside  Survey National Estimates of Broad Habitat extent and LCM2007 estimates. The two  analyses of LCM and Countryside Survey both showed different aspects of the data  sets and demonstrated that:   The level of agreement between LCM2007 and the Countryside Survey data sets  varies widely across the Broad Habitats.   Grassland categories are problematic because of the one-to-many relationship  between the observed land cover of grass and the many Broad Habitats where  grass is part of the habitat. This led to the development of the Broad Habitat  Association rules, which gave a third level of thematic accuracy to assess the  correspondences at, in addition, to the Broad Habitat level and the Aggregate  class level.   LCM2007 shows high correspondence with the area of „Arable and Horticulture‟  mapped by CS in 2007 for the 1km squares, however, as the estimates of Broad  Habitat extent show LCM2007 estimates a much higher „Arable and Horticulture‟  area. Some possible reasons for this are suggested in Section 4.3.    „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟ estimates for the UK vary by an order of magnitude,  between CS in 2007 and LCM2007. This is due to the complex mix of land cover  types that make up Fen areas, making them difficult to identify with spectral  classification, and the small size of many Fen areas. The comparison with the CS  1km squares suggests that a lot of what CS records as Fen and which is large  enough to be mappable by LCM2007 is actually recorded as either Rough  grassland or „Acid Grassland‟. This raises the possibility that future work could  use additional data sets to create a set of KBE‟s to allocate some of these  grassland areas to „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟. 73    Chapter 5: The LCM2007 product range      5.1 Example areas   A series of example areas taken from the LCM2007 vector product are presented in  this section.  A range of geographical areas have been chosen to illustrate the  performance of LCM2007 over a variety of different habitat and landscape types (see  Figure 5.1 for the legend), including upland areas (Figures 5.2 & 5.3), calcareous  (Figure 5.2), urban (Figure 5.4) and arable and fenland (Figure 5.5).

Figure 5.2 shows an area covered by a mixture of upland „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟, „Acid  Grassland‟ and „Bog‟ with the Penllyn Forest to the north and Lake Vyrnwy and Lake  Bala to the south-east and north, respectively. To the south-west the montane ridge  (cyan colour) of Aran Benllyn is apparent. 74    The second example shows a mixture of the „Calcareous Grassland‟ of Salisbury  Plain and its small patches of broadleaved woodland, and the surrounding arable  and „Improved Grassland‟ (Figure 5.3). The suburban towns of Amesbury and  Tidworth can be seen as well as the industrial areas of Boscombe Down airfield in  the south.      Figure 5.3.

Figure 5.7. Diagram to show the available LCM2007 data products    Vector data format   The vector data product is provided as polygons (land parcels) with each parcel  having a list of attributes attached to it. These include its area, source images, Broad  Habitat, and processing details, covering polygon construction, original spectral  classification and KBE history (see Table 5.1).  Note: Broad Habitats sub-classes (BHSub attribute in vector data set: Table 5.1) and  Field Codes (FieldCode attribute in vector data set: Table 5.1) are included in the  vector data set. The BHSub field gives a text description of the FieldCode. Broad  Habitat sub-classes are used in the classification process and identify sub-LCM2007  class land cover types. The Broad Habitat sub-classes are aggregated to produce  LCM2007 classes (see Table 5.2 for details of groupings). Broad Habitat sub-classes  may give additional information, but they are not necessarily recognised with the  accuracy or consistency of LCM2007 classes and Broad Habitats. They are included  in the data set primarily because they are included in the ProbList attribute  (described in Table 5.1), which gives the probability of the top five spectral classes  (named at Broad Habitat sub-class level). It is recommended that users apply their  own validation (for example the method summarised in Appendix 4) before using  data at the Broad Habitat sub-class level if they wish to use it, as it is not covered by  the LCM2007 quality assurance. 79    Raster data format   The raster data have been derived from the vector dataset using the LCM2007 Class  number shown in Table 5.2 and are stored as raster datasets at two different  resolutions:  1. 25m raster, consisting of 23 LCM2007 Classes (Table 5.2).  See Table 5.3 for  metadata.  2. 1km raster (Table 5.3), data derived from the 25m raster dataset and  summarised in two different ways:  A. Percentage values, each 1km pixel provides the percentage cover of a  particular land cover at LCM2007 Class level. Multiple sets of data are  provided, one for each LCM2007Class.   B. Dominant values, each 1km pixel provides data on the dominant  LCM2007 Class at that location.    Table 5.1. Description of the attributes of the LCM2007 vector data set.    Attribute  Description  Parcel_ID  Unique parcel identifier for each parcel, which includes the satellite image the polygon  was derived from. Follows the format: 11853977:c20 where 11853977 is the parcel id  and c20 means the polygon came from composite image c20. Image numbers may  also begin with an „i‟, e.g. i76, which signifies a single-date image. All images are  documented in Appendix 2.  BH  Dominant land cover at Broad Habitat level e.g. Coniferous Woodland  BHSub  Broad Habitat sub-class (Table 5.2). Gives a text description of the FieldCode.  FieldCode  Short text string giving field codes. Note field codes are used in the creation of  LCM2007, but the accuracy of the product at this level is not assessed. The LCM2007  team recommend that these codes are used only if users perform their own validation  on them.  INTCODE  RECOMMENDED FOR DISPLAY. This attribute gives the LCM2007 class as an  integer code from 1-23 (see Table 5.2). Note this is often referred to as LCM2007  class number. It is the class recommended for display and is the class validated by  the QA. This is the class displayed by the ArcGIS .lyr file.  KBE  Knowledge-based enhancement (KBE). Descriptor detailing the processing history of  each segment including the complete list of KBE‟s applied and the change instigated  by the KBE. The KBE notation follows a standard format of 2 or 3 letters followed by a  comma followed by original class and then the new class. E.g.     SL,Gr->Bg  signifies soil correction (SL) changing Rough Grassland to Bog. This would  occur when the polygon was on a bog soil, with no, or only slight, slope.    ALT,Sd->Gr signifies an altitude based correction (ALT) changing sand dune to Rough  Grassland. The change to Rough Grassland would be based on the next spectral class is  in the probability listing, as long as it was not a coastal class.  KBE identifiers:  MC - manual correction; SL - soil correction; CM - coastal mask;   OM - offshore mask; UR - urban mask; ALT - altitude correction  ProbList  The probability of the polygon belonging to a spectral variant class. The attribute lists  the 5 spectral classes that closest match the spectral signature of the polygon   e.g. Gr_d,0.87:Gr_u,0.09:Hga_d,0.04:Gi_n,0.00:Gi_e,0.00 (Table 5.2).  CorePixels  Total number of pixels within the core area of the segment used to perform the  maximum likelihood classification.   Construct  History of the construction of the polygon,    OSMM - Polygon derived from generalised OS Master Map data    OSMM:SEG - Generalised OS Master Map polygon(s) as basis with additional  segmentation    OSMM:AGC:SEG - Generalised OS Master Map polygon with agricultural payment  boundary vectors and segmentation  TotPixels  Total number of pixels in polygon. 80    Table 5.2.

Access to the LCM2007 data sets      The 1km raster data sets are available via the CEH Information Gateway:  https://gateway.ceh.ac.uk      The 25m raster and vector data sets are available under licence from CEH,   please complete the online application on the CEH web site [www.ceh.ac.uk/data]    or contact: spatialdata@ceh.ac.uk for further details.    Please note that licence fees may apply for some users and some applications. 82    Example datasets    LCM2007, like LCM1990 and LCM2000, is produced in a range of data formats and  at a range of thematic and spatial resolutions. This range of products is required to  support a wide range of potential applications. Figure 5.8 shows some examples of  the data sets available for LCM2007 and enables comparison of the level of detail  associated with each product.  Spatially the vector data set and the 25m raster data  set are quite similar, however, the advantage of the vector data set is that each  polygon has a set of metadata attached. The disadvantage of the vector is that this  increases the file size and may make processing unwieldy for some  applications/users. The 25m raster data set may be useful in such circumstances, as  it provides the same land cover detail but without the additional metadata information  and polygon boundaries; this is more appropriate for some applications. The 1km  data sets are typically most appropriate for applications modelling the whole of the  UK at fairly coarse scale and are often combined with additional data sets, such as  meteorological data set or species distribution data. By way of example, the  Broadleaved woodland percentage land cover 1km raster product is shown in  Figure 5.9 - it shows the distribution of broadleaved woodland across the UK.          Figure 5.8.

These products give stock estimates and distributions of Broad  Habitat-based classes for the UK, GB, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern  Ireland. LCM2007 will support a wide-range of environmental applications and a  broad range of users.  LCM2007 has several improvements over the previous CEH land cover maps.  A key  difference is that the spatial structure has been derived from detailed national  cartography (Ordnance Survey MasterMap and LPS Large-scale Vector).  This  enables LCM2007 to readily integrate with other national products and will therefore  increase its uptake and impact. By properly delineating real-world units of land cover,  the spatial framework has enabled a more spatially and thematically accurate  product than has been previously possible. Another major advantage is that the  generalised spatial structure will be re-usable as most of the boundaries in the UK  countryside are relatively static compared to changes in land cover.  This will  increase the efficiency of future national land cover mapping and monitoring  exercises, but more importantly, having a common structure for future land cover  monitoring activities will facilitate accurate change detection.    Change detection  Identifying, quantifying and understanding land cover change and the ecological  effects thereof are essential to meet national and international biodiversity  conservation targets. The three CEH land cover maps would seem an ideal resource  for this.  However, as Chapter 4 demonstrates there are complex issues to be  considered when comparing products with different spatial and thematic structures.  Comber et. al. (2004) have commented on the difficulties of reconciling change  between LCM1990 and LCM2000.    LCM1990 is a pixel based product with 25 bespoke habitat classes.  LCM2000 is a  polygon map based on image segments with habitats related to BAP Broad  Habitats.  LCM1990 and LCM2000 differ thematically and spatially.  LCM2007 is  close to LCM1990 thematically but its spatial structure, coming from generalised  digital cartography, is very different from the previous two.  Clearly comparing CEH  land cover products to detect change will not be straightforward; sophisticated  methods will be required to delineate real changes from those due to error and  methodological differences.  It may be possible to make some progress by looking at  change in aggregated classes (not necessarily the same ones used in the LCM2007  1km products) or by focussing on the most consistently mapped classes or by using  statistical methods that look at the trajectory of change and disregard those that  seem implausible.   However, it is likely that the most useful way forward will be to  re-organise the earlier CEH land cover maps into a common spatial structure based  on real-world units of land use.  The generalised spatial framework from LCM2007  provides this structure. 85      LCM2007 and Countryside Survey    LCM2007 has been produced as part of the Countryside Survey (CS) in 2007  project.  The field survey of CS and LCM2007 are very different conceptually but  complement each other in many ways. The field survey is based on in situ  observations of broad and fine scale habitat features, for a restricted number of field  sites (591 1km x 1km squares in 2007) that are distributed in a stratified random  manner across the UK landscape. Statistical procedures are used to extrapolate field  observations to produce national estimates for the stock and change of Broad  Habitats and it is informative to compare these independent estimates with those  produced by LCM2007 (see Chapter 4). Being based on satellite images there are  some land cover features that LCM2007 cannot resolve that the CS field survey  can.  For example, narrow linear features, such as hedgerows and streams, small  stands of woodland, narrow roads and small dwellings. The CS field survey can also  report on changes in the quality of habitats (e.g. plant species compositions) which is  not possible from satellite imagery. However, LCM2007 uniquely provides coast-to- coast coverage of Broad Habitats across the whole of the UK. It would be  prohibitively expensive and practically impossible to achieve similar coverage using  ground based techniques. Combining in situ and satellite derived information is  essential to advance our understanding of the UK land surface and to develop  optimal strategies for monitoring and managing our land. By considering the  evidence-bases of both approaches together and in conjunction with other data  sources (see below) our understanding of the UK landscape will be greatly  enhanced.     Other sources of information    There are many additional sources of information on UK Land Use/Land Cover.  For  example, the Forestry Commission maintains detailed maps derived from aerial  photography on land used for forestry.  There are readily available European land  cover and land survey products.  For example, Corine Land Cover Maps (1990, 2000  and 2006) derived from satellites, and LUCAS field surveys (2001, 2008 to 2009)  respectively.  Eurostat and the European Environment Agency are planning to roll  out LUCAS, Corine, and five pan-European high resolution land cover layers derived  from satellites every three years. To fully understand what is on the land surface,  sub-surface (soil and geology) and above surface (climate) information is also  useful.  Again the UK is very well placed for this with the British Geological Survey  maintaining detailed geological inventories; the NSRI, the James Hutton Institute and  the AFBI maintaining information on soils; and the Met Office on climate.  Future  land cover monitoring exercises should aim to develop land information systems that  integrate the wealth of information affecting the land surface and present the  resulting knowledge in policy relevant ways.  This will not be easy, but only by doing  so will the UK be able to continue to deliver the socio-economic benefits, supported  by a healthy landscape, and fulfil its conservation objectives. 86    Providing a scientific evidence-base     LCM2007 is a key component in developing a multi-tiered approach to habitat  monitoring, with data at a variety of scales (Earth observation, ecological modelling,  aerial photography, LiDAR and gound survey) being used to inform evidence-based  policy. LCM2007 is the third national-scale digital land cover map produced by CEH  and there have been five Countryside Surveys, between 1978 and 2007.  The UK is  therefore in a very fortunate position.  Nowhere else in the world has such rich  spatial and temporal data on land cover and habitats.  These products provide an  invaluable resource to UK scientists, policy makers and managers.  CEH's LCMs  have been used very widely, for example for the management of natural resources,  urban planning, carbon accounting, flood risk modelling and many more.  Over 600  data licenses have been granted for LCM1990 and LCM2000. A recent literature  search revealed approximately 400 journal publications that have referred to CEH  land cover maps.  Clearly they have had a huge scientific impact and LCM2007 will  continue and enhance this trend.     In conjunction with other data, LCM2007 will be an important evidence-base for  policy and other applications in a many sectors including:  •             Atmosphere & climate      •             Water & catchments  •             Ecosystem service assessment  •             Marine & coastal   •             Ecology & conservation   •             Impact assessment   •             Health & hazards   •             Agriculture  •             Landscape planning   •             Telecommunications   •             Urban studies   •             Statistics, information   •             Education & publicity   •             Carbon accounting    Specific examples of environmental policy areas where LCM2007 may be an  important source of information include:   Providing the most accurate, up-to-date UK land cover map, for use in  biodiversity assessment and tracking landscape change.   Serving as a contextual base map (Broad Habitat level) for higher-resolution  habitat mapping in the biodiversity surveillance strategy.   Enabling habitat network and connectivity analysis to be undertaken, as an  input to biodiversity assessment for policy making (e.g. informing woodland  expansion), biodiversity reporting (e.g. Natura) and 2020 biodiversity target  evaluation.   Providing a consistent UK frame of reference for informing and evaluating  policy, taking account of biogeographical variations and enabling country  comparisons.   Enabling the assessment of the „naturalness‟ of river catchments, as part of a  standard approach to evaluating rivers for conservation. 87    European links    The UK component of the Corine Land Cover 2006 (produced on behalf of the  European Environment Agency) is being derived from the LCM2007 vector product  by a process involving geometric generalisation and thematic transformations.  Corine is a key component of pan-European environmental assessment and  evidence-based policy making.     LCM2007 benefited from the increase in strategic thinking at a European level, with  the European Environment Agency and ESA, amongst others, producing the  IMAGE2006 data set for member countries. IMAGE2006 is a pan-European data set  of SPOT and IRS data, which provides continuous coverage of Europe at two points  in time, to support and build up demand for environmental monitoring based on  satellite data sets with approximately 25m resolution. IMAGE2006 data provided the  core set of data upon which LCM2007 was based.    Accessing LCM2007 data sets    The LCM2007 1km raster data sets are available via the CEH Information Gateway  [https://gateway.ceh.ac.uk]     The full vector product and 25m product are available under licence on request from  CEH.  Please  complete  the  online  application  on  the  CEH  web  site  [www.ceh.ac.uk/data] or contact spatialdata@ceh.ac.uk for further details.  Please  note that licence fees may apply for some users and some applications. 88    Glossary of terms and acronyms    Aggregate Classes: There are 10 Aggregate Classes and they are based on  combining LCM2007 Classes to a simplified 10-class level (see Table 2.2).    Attribute: Refers here to a data item, held in the geographical information system,  recording information about a GIS object; an attribute may be a numerical value (e.g.  altitude), an alphabetical code (e.g. Fd = Felled conifer) or a text string labelling or  describing the parcel (e.g. the polygon construction attribute).    AWIFS: Advanced Wide Field Sensor, a 56 m spatial resolution, 4 band pushbroom  sensor on the IRS platform.    BAP: Biodiversity Action Plan, UK Government's response to the Convention on  Biological Diversity (CBD) signed in 1992.     Broad Habitats: A classification by the UK Biodiversity Group to encompass the  entire range of UK habitats as an aid to the implementation of, and reporting under,  the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. A report providing guidance on the interpretation of  the Broad Habitat types is available at: http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-2433. For  summary of terrestrial Broad Habitats see Chapter 2.    Core pixels: Those pixels of a segment which extracted after shrinking the segment  geometry to avoid edge-pixels; they were used in deriving training statistics and/or in  deriving a segment‟s mean reflectance values for use in classification.    CS in 2007: Countryside Survey in 2007.     DTM: Digital Terrain Model.    EO: Earth Observation, field of activity associated with observations of the Earth‟s  surface, usually from satellite sensors.    ETM: Enhanced Thematic Mapper, a sensor on the satellite, Landsat 7, recording  visible and infrared reflectance. Damaged in 2003, although still produces some  data.    Generalisation: the process of reducing the level of detail in a vector data set.    GB: Great Britain, comprising of England, Scotland and Wales. Also includes the  outlying islands of Isle of Wight, Anglesey, Isles of Scilly, the Hebrides, Orkney and  Shetland. GB does not include the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.    GIS: Geographical Information System.    Image classification: Process used to change remote sensing images to classified  images. In a classified image each pixel has a class associated with it. Membership  of a class is based on the spectral characteristics of the pixel, which is compared to  the spectral characteristics of training areas of known class type. The spectral 89    characteristics of the training areas are used to determine the class membership of  each pixel/polygon in the image, using a classification algorithm. The algorithm used  for LCM2007 is the Maximum Likelihood Classifier.    Image segmentation: Process of „breaking up‟ an image into clusters of pixels with  very similar pixel values. It can be used to create polygons from a raster data set.    IRS: Indian Remote sensing Satellite. IRS is a satellite carrying the LISS-III and  AWIFS sensors.     Knowledge-based enhancements: Series of rules applied post-classification to aid  the determination of Broad Habitat type.    Landsat: US series of satellite platforms which carry the Thematic Mapper (TM) and  Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) sensors.     LCMGB: Land Cover Map of Great Britain, produced as part of Countryside Survey  in 1990. A pixel-based land cover map produced by semi-automated multi-temporal  classification and simple knowledge-based enhancement. 25m spatial resolution.    LCM2000: Land Cover Map 2000, produced as part of Countryside Survey in 2000.  A segment-based land cover map produced by image segmentation, semi- automated multi-temporal classification and knowledge-based enhancement. 0.5 ha  minimum mappable unit.    LCM2007: Land Cover Map 2007, produced as part of Countryside Survey in 2007.  A parcel-based land cover map, derived from generalised national cartography and  classified using multi-temporal image data, followed by post-classification application  of a suite of knowledge-based enhancements.    LISS-III: Linear Imaging Self Scanner – III, a 23.5 m spatial resolution, four band  pushbroom sensor on the IRS platform.    MasterMap: Ordnance Survey MasterMap (OSMM) - a very detailed cartographic  product for Great Britain.     MIR: Middle infrared.    MFW: Minimum feature width, the narrowest object, or part of an object that can be  mapped within the data set.    MMU: Minimum mappable unit. LCM2007 retains all segments with 9 or more pixels  (on the basis that a 3 x 3 pixel segment can contain a „pure‟ core pixel); segments  with <8 pixels (<0.5 ha in area) are „dissolved‟ into surrounding segments, with each  pixel individually attached to the neighbouring segment which was most similar in  spectral character.    NI: Northern Ireland.    NIR: Near infrared. 90      Object: A polygon in the LCM2007 GIS database.    OS: Ordnance Survey, the UK national mapping agency, responsible for the  production and maintenance of MasterMap.    OSNI: Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland, national mapping agency for Northern  Ireland.    Parcel: A parcel (sometimes called specifically a „land parcel‟) is an area on the  ground, often a field but perhaps with no boundary such as a woodland, a patch of  relatively uniform vegetation (e.g. heath), a built up area, or a water body.    Pre-processing: Early stages of image raster processing, which ensure that  atmospheric and topographic effects are minimised within the data and that the data  is properly geo-referenced. These stages are conducted before the image is  classified.    Producer’s accuracy (and Producer’s correspondence): Correspondence  matrices are often summarised by reporting the User‟s and Producer‟s accuracies.  The Producer‟s accuracy is a measure of how well the classification performed  against the reference data set (in this report: ground reference polygons in Section  3.9, or CS in 2007 polygons in Section 4.2). In this report the term „Producer‟s  accuracy‟ is used in Chapter 3 when LCM2007 is compared to a data set expected  to be of higher accuracy than LCM20007. The term „Producer‟s correspondence‟ is  used in Chapter 4, when LCM2007 is compared to a data set expected to be of  similar accuracy.     Raster: A grid-based data structure used in GIS and image analysis systems.    RPA: Rural Payment Agency, an Executive Agency of the Department for  Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). RPA provides key services for making  rural payments, carrying out rural inspections, and livestock tracing.    Segment: The spectrally-defined aggregation of image pixels into a vector polygon,  held in the GIS database; the term „segment‟ is intended to distinguish the resultant  feature from a „land parcel‟ which refers to the actual feature on the ground. Often,  segments record parcels, but with differences which relate to the underlying 25m  structure of the image.    Spatial framework: Is used to describe the network of polygons that make-up the  LCM2007 and CS in 2007 vector data sets. The spatial frameworks (i.e. the  polygons) vary between the two data sets, in part, due to different minimum  mappable units.     Spectral classes: Cover types with distinct spectral signatures: for example,  „shaded north-facing‟ and „sunlit south-facing‟ are two distinct spectral classes of  „improved grass‟; chalk, clay and peat soil background give different spectral classes  of „wheat‟. Spectral classes may differ according to species content, crop variety, 91    phenology, management practices, atmospheric haze, cloud shadow or any other  factor with an impact on the recorded spectral reflectance.    Spot: Satellite pour l‟Observation de la Terre - French series of satellites. Some data  from SPOT 4 and SPOT 5 were used in LCM2007.    Summer target period: The main growing season for arable crops, from mid-May to  late July in southern Britain, or later in Scotland, excluding May but continuing into  August; 2007 was the first choice year, then 2008 and 2007.    Target period: See ‘Summer target period‟ and „Winter target period‟.    Training: The procedure by which a sample of known cover types is defined in the  image processing system to deduce the spectral characteristics of classes, to form  the basis for automatic extrapolation by the system to classify examples of unknown  land cover.    TM: Thematic Mapper, a sensor on the Landsat 5 satellite, recording visible and  infrared reflectance.     User’s accuracy (and Producer’s correspondence): Correspondence matrices  are often summarised by reporting the User‟s and Producer‟s accuracies. The User‟s  accuracy gives the probability that a pixel classified as a class belongs to that class.   In this report the term „User‟s accuracy‟ is used in Chapter 3 when LCM2007 is  compared to a data set expected to be of higher accuracy than LCM20007. The term  „User‟s correspondence‟ is used in Chapter 4, when LCM2007 is compared to a data  set expected to be of similar accuracy.     UK: United Kingdom, comprising of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  Also includes the outlying islands of Isle of Wight, Anglesey, Isles of Scilly, the  Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland. The UK does not include the Channel Islands and  the Isle of Man.    Vector: A digital line held as a series of x-, y-coordinates in a geographical  information system.    Winter target period: From the time of the first frosts (about October) to late April in  southern Britain and well into May in the Scottish Highlands (i.e. until deciduous  trees were in full leaf); the target winter was from Autumn 2006 to Spring 2007. 92    References     Allaby, A., and Allaby, M., A Dictionary of Earth Sciences.

Broadleaved, Mixed and Yew Woodland  This Broad Habitat is characterised by vegetation dominated by trees >5m high  when mature, with tree cover >20%. Scrub (<5 m) requires cover >30% for inclusion  in this Broad Habitat.  It includes stands of both native and non-native broadleaved  trees and yew. Woodlands dominated by coniferous species but with >20% cover by  deciduous species are included in this category.  Areas of fen woodland dominated  by species such as willow (Salix spp.), alder (Alnus glutinosa) or birch (Betula spp.)  are also included.     2. Coniferous Woodland  This Broad Habitat is characterised by vegetation dominated by trees >5m high  when mature, which forms a canopy having a cover of >20%. „Coniferous Woodland‟  includes semi-natural stands and plantations and includes both native and non- native coniferous trees.     3. Boundaries and Linear Features  This Broad Habitat type covers a range of linearly arranged landscape features such  as hedgerows, lines of trees, walls, stone and earth banks, grass strips and dry  ditches. These features are not mapped by LCM2007 as they are generally too  narrow to be reliably captured from the satellite images.  It is included here as its  inclusion in Countryside Survey is relevant for the Comparison between LCM2007  and Countryside Survey in Chapter 4.    4. Arable and Horticulture  This Broad Habitat includes annual crops, perennial crops, woody crops, intensively  managed commercial orchards, commercial horticultural land (such as nurseries,  commercial vegetable plots and commercial flower growing areas), freshly-ploughed  land, annual leys, rotational set-aside and fallow.      5. Improved Grassland  „Improved Grassland‟ is characterised by vegetation dominated by a few fast- growing grasses such as Lolium spp., and also white clover (Trifolium repens), on  fertile, neutral soils.  Improved Grasslands are typically either managed as pasture or  mown regularly for silage production or in non-agricultural contexts for recreation and  amenity purposes.    6. Neutral Grassland  This Broad Habitat type is characterised by vegetation dominated by grasses and  herbs on a range of neutral soils usually with a pH of between 4.5 and 6.5. It 95    includes enclosed dry hay meadows and pastures, together with a range of  grasslands which are periodically inundated with water or permanently moist.    7. Calcareous Grassland  „Calcareous Grassland‟ is characterised by vegetation dominated by grasses and  herbs on shallow, well-drained soils which are rich in bases (principally calcium  carbonate) formed by the weathering of chalk and other types of limestone or base- rich rock. Soil pH tends to be high (>6) although it may be as low as 5.    8. Acid Grassland  „Acid Grassland‟ is characterised by vegetation dominated by grasses and herbs on  a range of lime-deficient soils which have been derived from acidic bedrock or from  superficial deposits such as sands and gravels. Such soils usually have a low base  status, with a pH of <5.5.     9. Bracken   This Broad Habitat type covers areas dominated by a continuous canopy cover of  bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) at the height of the growing season. It does not  include areas with scattered patches of bracken or areas of bracken which are >0.25  ha which are included in the Broad Habitat type with which they are associated.     10. Dwarf Shrub Heath  „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟ is characterised by vegetation that has >25% cover of plant  species from the heath family (ericoids) or dwarf gorse Ulex minor. It generally  occurs on well-drained, nutrient-poor, acid soils.  This habitat type does not include  dwarf shrub dominated vegetation in which species characteristic of peat-forming  vegetation such as cotton-grass Eriophorum spp. and peat-building sphagna are  abundant, or that occurs on deep peat (> 0.5 m) as these are included in the 'Bog'  Broad Habitat type.     11. Fen, Marsh and Swamp  This habitat includes fen, flushes, springs, fen meadows, rush pasture and swamp.  Fens are peatlands which receive water and nutrients from groundwater and surface  run-off, as well as from rainfall. Flushes are associated with lateral water movement,  and springs with localised upwelling of water. Marsh is a general term usually used  to imply waterlogged soil; it is used more specifically here to refer to fen meadows  and rush-pasture communities on mineral soils and shallow peats. Swamps are  characterised by tall emergent vegetation. Reedbeds (i.e. swamps dominated by  stands of common reed Phragmites australis) are also included in this type.  Apart  from rush pasture, examples of this Broad Habitat are relatively rare.    12. Bog   This Broad Habitat type covers wetlands that support vegetation that is usually peat- forming and which receive mineral nutrients principally from precipitation rather than  ground water. This is referred to as ombrotrophic (rain-fed) mire. The Bog Broad 96    Habitat includes ericaceous, herbaceous and mossy swards in areas with a peat  depth >0.5m.    13. Standing Open Water and Canals  This Broad Habitat type includes natural systems such as lakes, meres and pools, as  well as man-made waters such as reservoirs, canals, ponds and gravel pits.    14. Rivers and Streams   The 'Rivers and Streams' Broad Habitat type covers rivers and streams from bank  top to bank top, or where there are no distinctive banks or banks are never  overtopped, it includes the extent of the mean annual flood.    15. Montane  The „Montane Habitats‟ category includes a range of vegetation types that occur  exclusively in the montane zone such as prostrate dwarf shrub heath, snow-bed  communities, sedge and rush heaths, and moss heaths. The distinction between the  sub-montane and montane zone is often blurred and the two usually merge through  a band of transitional vegetation.    16. Inland Rock  This Broad Habitat type covers both natural and artificial exposed rock surfaces  which are >0.25ha, such as inland cliffs, caves, screes and limestone pavements, as  well as various forms of excavations and waste tips such as quarries and quarry  waste.    17. Built-Up Areas and Gardens  This Broad Habitat type covers urban and rural settlements, farm buildings, caravan  parks and other man-made built structures such as industrial estates, retail parks,  waste and derelict ground, urban parkland and urban transport infrastructure. It also  includes domestic gardens and allotments. This type does not include amenity  grassland which should be included in the 'Improved Grassland' category.    18. Supralittoral Rock  „Supralittoral Rock„  occurs above the high water mark, in areas influenced by wave  splash and sea-spray. Features that may be present include vertical rock, boulders,  gullies, ledges and pools, depending on the wave exposure of the site and its  geology.    19. Supralittoral Sediment  „Supralittoral Sediment‟ occurs above the high water mark, but in areas influenced by  wave splash and sea-spray. Includes shingle beaches, sand dunes and machair.    20. Littoral Rock  The geology and wave exposure of the shore influence the form of Littoral Rock  habitats, which can be as varied as vertical rock, shore platforms, boulder shores, or 97    rocky reefs surrounded by areas of sediment. In general, „Littoral Rock‟ tends to be  colonised by algae in wave-sheltered conditions, and by limpets, barnacles and  mussels as wave-exposure increases.    21. Littoral Sediment  Areas of „Littoral Sediment„  are widespread around the UK forming features such as  beaches, sand banks, and intertidal mudflats. A large proportion of this habitat  occurs in estuaries and inlets where it can cover extensive areas. Saltmarsh is  included within this Broad Habitat.    22. Inshore Sublittoral Sediment  All areas of sea and estuary class are assumed to be „Inshore Sublittoral Sediment‟.   It is defined as within six nautical miles of the shoreline by JNCC. 98    Appendix 2: Satellite Images    Table 1: The complete list of images pre-processed for LCM2007.

4: Bespoke validation    There is no absolute truth in geography and the “quality” of any geographical  “product” (such as a land cover map) depends on the use to which it is put. The  purpose of an accuracy assessment ought to be whether the product is “fit for  purpose”, in this case will using the LCM2007 lead to a better result than if it is not  used? Unfortunately, we can not anticipate all the possible uses that the land cover  map might be put to; therefore we can only supply a general assessment in terms of  comparisons with various field surveys (which are themselves subject to similar  levels of inconsistencies).     An unusual and very useful feature of the LCM2007 (and its predecessor the  LCM2000) is that it provides parcel level metadata. This means that for all parcels  we know what (if any) KBE have been applied and the probability of the 5 most likely  land cover variants for that parcel (before any KBE has been applied). This metadata  can be mined to allow a user to examine the quality of the categories that are  relevant to their study in their location (as the quality of the imagery varies from place  to place). In essence the proposed methodology make use of high resolution  imagery, (such as that found on GoogleEarth or similar product) to decide whether  the LCM2007 attribution is consistent with the imagery. This can be considered as  an informal Bayesian approach. It is not always possibly to be definitive as to  whether the image is consistent with the LCM2007, so it is suggested that multiple  “fuzzy” categories, such as: “plausible”, “probably”, “possibly”, are used. Doing so  allows an upper and lower estimate to be made on the accuracy of each target class.  The methodology suggests assessing each target classes (relevant to your study) in  two parts; parcels with a high probability of belonging to the class and those with a  moderate probability. A research tool based on Python scripts has been developed. 110    Appendix 5: Broad Habitat Association (BHA)    This Appendix summarises the rationale behind the Broad Habitat Association rules  (shown in Table 4.1) on a class-by-class basis.    Bog  Issue: „Bog‟ forms part of an ecological continuum covering „Acid Grassland‟, „Dwarf  Shrub Heath‟ and some types of „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟ and the separation of  these habitats can be difficult, as the surface vegetation (i.e. land cover) maybe very  similar and the division rests on the depth of peat. The division in the field can  account for species presence, plus peat depth, but for LCM2007 the division is  based on soil data sets.   Rule: LCM classifications of „Bog‟ provide an acceptable correspondence, with CS  classifications of „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟, „Acid Grassland‟, and „Montane Habitats‟. This  rule is reciprocal, so LCM classifications of „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟, „Acid Grassland‟  and „Montane Habitats‟ are an acceptable correspondence with CS classifications of  „Bog‟.     Dwarf Shrub Heath  Issue Upland environments containing „Acid Grassland‟ and „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟  may form an ecological continuum from one habitat to another, or a mosaic of both  habitats. In such cases it is then difficult to separate the area into discrete polygons  of „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟ or „Acid Grassland‟. The comparison between LCM2007 and  CS in 2007 is further compounded by differences in the spatial structure of the two  products. The spatial structure affects transitional classes as the size of the polygon  affects the proportion of heather and gorse to acid grassland, which determines  whether the polygon is classified as „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟ (> 25% of heather or dwarf  gorse), or „Acid Grassland‟ (<25% heather or gorse).  Rule: LCM2007 „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟ is acceptable correspondence with CS “Acid  grassland” and reciprocally LCM2007 “Acid grassland” is acceptable for CS „Dwarf  Shrub Heath‟.    Montane Habitats  Issue: LCM2007 classifies upland areas based on spectral characteristics, after  which a KBE is applied to identify montane areas on the basis of altitude and the  presence of vegetation. „Montane Habitats‟ thus replaces polygons which would  otherwise be classified as „Acid Grassland‟, „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟ and „Bog‟. In most  cases this works well, but LCM2007 is unable to separate areas above the montane  threshold which are genuinely „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟, „Bog‟ or „Acid Grassland‟, rather  than „Montane Habitats‟.  Rule: An LCM2007 classification of „Montane Habitats‟ is an acceptable  correspondence, at the BH adjacency level, with CS classifications of „Dwarf Shrub  Heath‟, „Acid Grassland‟ and „Bog‟. This rule is reciprocal, as LCM2007 will not  record any montane below the montane height threshold.    Built up Areas and Gardens  Issue: LCM2007 allows a variety of land cover types to occur within the urban  boundary, whereas CS map polygons as urban, but attach other attributes, which 111    may identify the land cover type as water, grassland, woodland. In CS areas of  grassland > 1ha are mapped as improved grassland, if occurring with an urban area.  Rule: when CS has recorded a parcel as „Built-up Areas and Gardens‟ it forms an  acceptable correspondence if LCM has recognised the same parcel as being  grassland, woodland or  water. This is not reciprocal.    ‘Fen, Marsh and Swamp’  Issue: „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟ is characterised by a variety of vegetation types and  land cover types, which are often found in a mosaic. This causes 2 problems for a  spectral classification: first, parcel-based spectral classifications perform poorly with  polygons of mixed land cover. Second, if the „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟ is large then it  may cover several polygons, which may be classified as Freshwater, „Neutral  Grassland‟, Rough grassland, „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟ and scrub (falls into the  Broadleaved woodland class).   Rule: if LCM has recorded the polygon as Freshwater, Acid grassland, Rough  grassland,  and  Broad-leaved  woodland  then  it  forms  an  acceptable  correspondence if CS has recorded „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟. This is not reciprocal.    Rough grassland  Issue: The LCM2007 class Rough grassland contains low productivity „Improved  Grassland‟ and acid, neutral and calcareous grassland, which could not be assigned  with confidence to specific grassland Broad Habitats. For the purposes of Broad  Habitat comparison it is nominally assigned to the „Neutral grassland’ class (as in  LCM2000, see Fuller et al., 2002), however for the Broad Habitat Association  correspondence it is more appropriate to accept that it contains contributions from a  range of grassland BH.  Rule: accept LCM2007 Rough grassland if it corresponds with „Improved  Grassland‟ and Acid, Neutral or Calcareous grasslands or „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟.    Water classes  Issue: LCM2007 maps water, with assignment to Saltwater or Freshwater based  on spatial context.   Rule: LCM2007 Saltwater or Freshwater are a suitable correspondence with all CS  water classes. This rule is not reciprocal.    Tidal areas  Issue: the tidal position at the time of satellite data acquisition or field survey affects  the mapping of the saltwater and „Littoral Rock‟ and sediment classes.  Rule: LCM2007 Saltwater and CS „Littoral Rock‟ and sediment are acceptable  correspondences. This rule is reciprocal. 112                Text and maps in this publication are the copyright of the Natural Environment Research Council  unless otherwise stated and may not be reproduced without permission. © NERC (CEH) 2011.

Brief description of the dataset Two remote sensing soil moisture datasets (one passive microwave dataset: SMAP, and one active microwave dataset: ASCAT) and a modelled soil moisture dataset (from JULES-CHESS land surface model) were combined to produce a single more reliable soil moisture product based on triple collocation error estimation and a least-squares merging scheme. Evaluation using in-situ soil moisture measurements from the COSMOS-UK network shows that the merged soil moisture integrates the characteristics of model simulation and satellite observations and particularly improves the limited temporal variability of the JULES-CHESS simulation. The dataset covers the period going from 1st April 2015 to 31st December 2017, at a daily timestep, and is available at two spatial resolutions: 12.5km, which is the resolution of the original dataset described in Peng et al. (2021); and 1km, which has been obtained after resampling all three underlying datasets to a 1km resolution.  Data and methods Data Sources The data sources that were used to derive this Soil Moisture Dataset are: NASA’s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) radiometer L3 soil moisture product (O’Neill et al., 2019) at 9km daily resolution ;  EUMETSAT’s soil moisture product from the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) basckscatter observation, 12.5km sampling version (H SAF, 2020). ASCAT soil moisture is provided in units of degree of saturation. To convert this into units of volumetric water content (to match the unit of the other two datasets), the following conversion was applied: Volumetric water content = degree of saturation (%) x porosity To estimate porosity, we used the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD, Wieder et al., 2014) and the pedo-transfer function from Toth et al. (2015) -  equation 22 from the supplementary material:  θs = 0.63052 - 0.10262 * BD2 + 0.0002904 * pH2 + 0.0003335 * Cl θs  is the saturated soil moisture content (≈porosity), BD = bulk density, pH is pH in water, Cl is Clay content (%). BD, pH and Cl values are taken from HWSD.  JULES-CHESS soil moisture product: JULES land surface model was run driven by Climate Hydrology and Ecology research Support System meteorology (CHESS-met) dataset, which includes 1 km resolution gridded meteo-rological variables over the UK (Robinson et  al., 2017). For full details of model configuration and parameters used for this run, please see Peng et al. (2021). Soil moisture data from the COSMOS-UK network (Cooper et al., 2021) was used to evaluate and validate the merged product (see Peng et al., 2021). Method for deriving the merged Soil Moisture Dataset Merging different soil moisture products is advantageous because it minimizes random retrieval errors. The current dataset was produced using a least-squares merging scheme to obtain optimal estimates of soil moisture over the UK mainland. The least squares framework can be described as (Yilmaz et al., 2012): Where is the merged soil moisture, is the individual soil moisture product, and  is the weight that is assigned to each product. The weights are calculated to minimize the random errors in the merged product. The weights are decided by the error variances and covariances of the soil moisture products (Gruber et al, 2019). The Triple Collocation (TC) method is an effective way to estimate random error variances. It can also be used to derive relative rescaling factors that will match the variability of different products to a common data space. For example, taking product X as the reference, then the scaling factors can be calculated as (Gruber et al. 2016): Where  is the scaling factor for each product and is determined by error covariances. Clearly,  is set to 1 due to its serving as the reference. Then the products Y and Z are rescaled using the following equations (Gruber et al. 2017; Gruber et al. 2016): Where ,  and  are the temporal mean of X, Y and Z respectively. For the merged Soil Moisture Dataset, SMAP L3 data was chosen as the reference (X). The weight  of each product is then derived as follows (Gruber et al. 2017; Zeng et al. 2016): For collocated triplets, the above formula is used to estimate weights from the rescaled products and merge the rescaled products based on equation 1. In order to increase the data coverage of the merged product, a merging scheme proposed by Gruber et al. (2017) based on the one-tailed Pearson’s correlation significance is applied for the non-collocated samples. TC weighted merging is applied if p-value is less than 0.05 among the three products. Where only two datasets are available, the least-squared-based weights are derived from the uncertainties and a weighted average between the two products is used for merging. Table 1 details the alternative methods used if TC merging is rejected, including the decision on whether to use one product, the arithmetic mean of two products, or to disregard the pixel. This simple averaging scheme might become problematic if one product is well sampled in time but with significantly low quality. The use of this product to fill the gaps of higher quality dataset may reduce the overall quality of the merged time series. However, improved soil moisture temporal coverage is preferable to absolute quality for many applications such as drought monitoring and runoff simulation. Therefore, this simple averaging scheme is used in order to provide the highest possible sample density. To derive the 12.5km version of this dataset, SMAP L3 and JULES-CHESS are firstly resampled to 12.5 km spatial resolution and then merged together with ASCAT using the proposed scheme. For the 1km version, SMAP L3 and ASCAT are first resampled to 1km. Table 1: Merging scheme for non-collocated grids. X, Y, and Z refer to different soil moisture products.  *where only two datasets are available, the least-squared-based weights are derived from the uncertainties and a weighted average between the two products is used in the merging. Validation Peng at al. (2021) describes extensively the evaluation analysis done on various remote sensing soil moisture products, JULES-CHESS soil moisture and the merged product, using COSMOS-UK network (Cooper et al., 2021) in-situ measurement of soil moisture as “ground truth”.  Pearson correlation coefficient (R), and unbiased Root Mean Square Difference (ubRMSD) were used to quantify the differences between each soil moisture product and the COSMOS-UK measurements.  These metrics are defined as follows: Where  is the soil moisture dataset to be evaluated,  is the COSMOS-UK reference soil moisture. cov is the covariance of both soil moisture time period, while  and  are the standard deviations of the soil moisture period. The overbar in each equation indicates the temporal mean of entire time period. Overall, the analysis showed that the merged product is better performing than any satellite product, and has similar performance to JULES-CHESS (Figure 1), but with the advantage of having an improved temporal variability (Figure 2).   Figure 1: Evaluation of ASCAT, SMAP L3E, SMAP L4, JULES-CHESS, and merged absolute soil moisture values against independent COSMOS-UK measurements.  Figure 2: Time series of the soil moisture from JULES-CHESS and merged soil moisture from two example COSMOS-UK stations. The blue points on the graphs represents COSMOS soil moisture, the green crosses are for JULES-CHESS, whereas the red ones are for the merged product. Appropriate use of the merged Soil Moisture Dataset Soil moisture is notoriously difficult to monitor and model for soils with high organic content. Consequently, modelled soil-moisture from JULES-CHESS, and observed soil moisture both from satellite data and COSMOS instruments are all more uncertain over organic soils. Therefore, care should be taken when using Hydro-JULES Soil Moisture Dataset over peatlands and other areas with high organic matter content as the values are likely to be less reliable.  Soil moisture values over urban areas such as large cities are also likely to be less reliable. Following table 1, TC was rejected over many of the main large cities due to low agreement of products between them (Figure 3).  Users are advised to check the merging method summary grid (Figure 3) to know which merging method was used in their area of interest. Soil moisture estimate is less reliable where TC was not applied.

To understand exactly how the present Countryside Survey sampling framework has been derived, it is  important to review the concepts and activities that have evolved over the last 30 years since the first survey  was carried out.  It is possible that if the earlier time-series data were not so valuable as a basis for detecting  change, and a fresh start could be made today, then a different sampling strategy might be well be adopted.   However, the present Countryside Survey methodology is inextricably linked with its predecessors and an  understanding of these is essential.    Early development of the ITE Land Classification  The beginning  In the early 1970s, the idea of widespread ecological survey of areas as big as Great Britain was barely  conceivable.  However the concept of ecological sampling at a smaller scale (e.g. individual woodlands), was  commonly accepted and it was Bunce and Shaw13 who developed local regional survey into a national  ecological sampling system.  The important part of the approach was that the sampled areas should be  representative of the whole region and, to ensure this, they employed a stratification system.  The importance of a stratified system  In order to avoid bias in the selection of samples (thereby potentially invalidating the results), any sample  should be based on objective (e.g. random) selection procedures.  However, purely random sampling  programmes run the risk of selecting, by chance, a number of samples which are at one extreme in a range of  variability and therefore not ‘typical’ of the whole population being sampled.  An extreme example would be  where a national opinion poll, by chance, only included teenagers in the sample - their voting intentions may  not be representative of the voting population at large.    To minimise this risk, stratification systems are used to ‘carve up’ the population into discreet layers, or strata,  so that all parts of the population are sampled.  In the analogy above, most national opinion polls sample  within different age strata.  In ecological terms, it is likely that different species and ecological processes occur  in different types of land.  A simple stratification might then divide the land surface into different altitude ranges  so that uplands and lowlands, which tend to have different ecological characteristics, are adequately sampled.  However, this represents a very simple stratification and, just as opinion polls attempt to sample not just  different age strata but also those concerned with gender, social, racial and regional backgrounds, so other  factors are important in ecological survey.  Land at a certain altitude in north-east Scotland may have different 3 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007)  The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey   ecological affinities to land at the same altitude in East Anglia.  Thus other, secondary strata may need to be  introduced.  If this argument is extended to its logical conclusion, then it can be seen that many different strata  may need to be created by combining a number of different determining factors.  This is the theoretical basis  of the ITE Land Classification.    Development of the first version of the ITE Land Classification system.  In the early 1970s, Bunce and Shaw carried out a sample survey of the Lake District National Park.  They had  spent several years surveying and classifying vegetation in woodlands13 and elsewhere; this depended on  recording plant species in square plots (quadrats) and then classifying the quadrats into groups (vegetation  types) depending on which species were present.  Thus, all the quadrats in one group tended to have more or  less similar species present while those in another group had different species.  They used a multivariate  classification system called Indicator Species Analysis (ISA)35 to group the quadrats.  Bunce and Shaw  realised that the same approach could be ‘scaled up’ to classify areas of land, except that the quadrats would  be larger (eg a 1 km square) and, instead of using species as the basis of classifying, they would use  environmental attributes (such as altitude, geology and climate).  The work was pioneered in the Lake District  National Park and then extended and tested in Cumbria14, Lancashire and other regions of GB.  In 1975, the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology (ITE), capitalising on the potential of the approach, provided  funding for a national ecological survey of GB.  The survey had two major prerequisites:  •  it should be carried out using field survey (in order to obtain the level of ecological information required),   •  it should be carried out within a single field season.  As a result of the earlier work in Cumbria and elsewhere, it was thought that the sample unit of a 1km square  was appropriate, being small enough to survey in a reasonable period of time and yet large enough to contain  sufficient environmental features to allow differentiation of squares.  With over 240,000 1km squares in GB, a  sampling approach was an obvious necessity and a stratified, random sampling system was then developed –  the ITE Land Classification was born.  In the mid-1970s, when this work was being done, computing power was such that software packages like ISA  could only operate on a limited number of datasets.  Thus it was not possible to create a classification of all 1  km squares in GB and an alternative strategy had to be found.  By taking the centre square of a 15 x 15 km  grid across GB, a suitable number of squares was identified for classification (1228).  Environmental,  physiographic and other mapped data were then collected for each of the 1228 squares and the dataset was  analysed using ISA to produce 32 classes (Table 1).  Four squares surrounding each of the classified squares  were also allocated to classes using the key provided by ISA; thus a total of 6040 squares were classified  (Figure 1).  Full details of this procedure can be found in Bunce et al6 and Bunce et al7.  The 32 classes were  then described based on the average values of the environmental characteristics that were used to generate  the classes (for example, average altitude, slope and rainfall, and host of other environmental values).    The sampling framework for the first ecological survey of GB in 1978  Having generated the classification which would act as the sampling stratification system, the number of  samples to be surveyed was considered.  Ideally, this number would depend on the size of the stratum (ie how  many 1 km squares of the class occurred in GB) and on the ecological variability within the stratum.  Previous  work had suggested that for ecological surveys of this type, at least eight samples per stratum were  necessary.  Since this was the minimum requirement for each class, and resources were not available to  survey more squares, then eight were selected at random from each of the classes.  These squares were  taken from the grid of classified squares and thus the final sample for the first GB survey was a gridded,  stratified, random sample of 256 1 km squares.  The survey was actually carried out in the summers of 1977  (when a few pilot squares were sampled) and 1978 and focussed on vegetation quadrats and soils; habitat  areas were also mapped. 4 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007) The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey Table 1.

Map of ‘original’ (1978) ITE Land Classification 6 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007) The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey   The sampling framework for the second, land use survey of GB in 1984  In 1984, ITE funded a further GB survey although, by this time, the emphasis had shifted away from ecological  features such as soils and plant species in quadrats, to land use, landscape features and habitat mapping.   The same sampling framework was used as in 1978 but the sample size was increased by 50% so that 12  squares were surveyed in each of the 32 classes (including the eight squares previously visited).  With the  benefit of hindsight, there is an argument for having allocated the additional 128 new squares according to  land class size which would certainly have reduced the statistical error terms associated with national  estimates made from the sample.  However, this was not done.  Examples of change statistics between 1978  and 1984 were published in Barr et al.2    Application of the ITE Land Classification to Countryside Survey 1990   By 1990, and following the Ecological Consequences of Land Use Change (ECOLUC) programme carried out  by ITE on contract to the then Department of the Environment (DOE)3, both scientific and policy needs for a  further survey were identified.  Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990) was initiated with DOE, NERC, DTI and  NCC all contributing funding.  The first Land Cover Map of GB, derived from satellite imagery was also linked  to this programme.  Again, the ITE Land Classification was used as the sampling framework for a field survey but, in this third  survey, additional squares were allocated only to the larger land classes.  A total of 508 squares was surveyed  and all the features recorded in the 1984 survey, plus a repeat of the 1978 vegetation quadrats, was carried  out3.  The distribution of the squares within the Land Classes is shown in Table 2 and a map of sites is shown  as Figure 2.    Further development of the ITE Land Classification  CS1990 still used the original, gridded land classification that had been developed in the mid-1970s and  results were published based on the use of that system.  However, it became apparent that for estimations at  the regional and local level, the land classification had to be extended so that every square in GB was  classified.    Although computing power had increased considerably since the first classification, it was still an  insurmountable task to collect data for every square in GB at the same level of detail as had been done in the  original work.  Instead, the major climatic, geological and physiographic factors (or valid surrogates for these)  were obtained for each square and then a variety of multivariate classification procedures was tested on the  resulting dataset.  When the classes of the original sample of 1228 squares were compared with the new  classification attempts, the best simulation resulted in only a 62% correspondence.  However, all of the  squares that did not match exactly did fall into neighbouring land classes and the average characteristics of  the class remained unchanged, thus the classification was accepted as a reasonable replacement for its  earlier counterpart (Figure 3).    The net effect of this on the sampling framework was that as a result of some of the squares changing class,  the distribution across land classes was distorted and some classes were not well represented.  The effect of  this can be seen in column 3 of Table 2. 7 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007)  The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey   Figure 2.  Map of 1978, 1984 and 1990 sample squares 8 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007) The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey Figure 3.  Map of the ‘new’ (1990) ITE Land Classification. 9 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007)  The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey   Developments of the ITE Land Classification for Countryside Survey 2000  During the planning stages of Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000), there was consideration of sample  numbers in connection with several of the component modules.  This involved re-assessment of the existing  (CS1990) sample as well as the need for additional 1 km squares.  A number of issues have arisen from an  independent appraisal of CS1990 for policy purposes.  These include:  •  the effects of the changed ITE Land Classification.  •  the need to produce separate reliable estimates of surveyed features for Scotland and England with  Wales,  •  the need to provide statistically reliable estimates of upland habitats in England and Wales.  The new ITE Land Classification  As discussed above, the application of the new ITE Land Classification has resulted in some classes being  under-represented.  To correct this imbalance, a number of new squares were included as part of CS2000; the  details of how these are allocated are presented below, under ‘Separate country estimates’.  Separate country estimates  In CS1990, 508 1 km squares were sampled in England, Scotland, Wales and the Isle of Man.  The sample of  squares was drawn at random from a grid of squares in the 32 ITE Land Classes.  As described above, these  classes were created using underlying environmental attributes and therefore crossed country (E, S & W)  boundaries.  Country estimates were derived from the mean characteristics of all squares in each class,  irrespective of their country location.  A CS2000 Scoping Study34 recommended that the sampling framework should be modified to enable reporting  on ‘country units’, being (a) England with Wales and (b) Scotland, separately using only squares which lie in  the country for which estimates are to be made.  Additional samples have been deployed to assist with this requirement and the following changes have been  made to the sampling framework:  • class sub-division - the ITE Land Classes have been sub-divided into the ‘country unit’ versions of the  original classes,  • class aggregation - where this has resulted in there being very few squares of any particular class  remaining in a country, then this ‘rump’ has been aggregated with a similar class in that country (the net effect  of the class sub-divisions and aggregations is to create 40 strata, instead of the earlier 32),  • additional squares - to ensure that there is adequate representation of all new classes in each country unit,  19 additional squares have been allocated and this gives a minimum of 6 squares in each new class.  To  ensure relatively consistent sampling rates between England and Wales, a further 11 squares (5 in England  and 6 in Wales) have been allocated,  • Land Class 17 - Wales is dominated by Land Class 17 and to help refine the results reported for Wales, a  sub-division of Land Class 17 has been carried out in Wales.  In the allocation of any new squares in Wales  (either detailed above or in any further options), representation of the new sub-classes has been respected.  • Isle of Man – the two sample squares in the IOM included in previous surveys do not contribute to  estimates for ‘country units’ and are replaced by two new squares in England.  The revised land class maps for England with Wales and for Scotland are shown as Figure 4. 10 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007) The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey Figure 4.  Map of revised ITE Land Classes in ‘England with Wales’ and in Scotland – the  sampling framework for CS2000 11 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007)  The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey   Survey of uplands in England and Wales  An additional module within CS2000, funded by DETR, MAFF, and WO/CCW, included surveying an  additional 30 squares which have been placed in ITE Land Classes which occur in the uplands and marginal  uplands of England and Wales.  This gives better statistical accuracy to the estimates of habitats in the uplands of England and Wales which,  due to the need to provide separate, country-based estimates, would otherwise be under-sampled.

Map of the CS2000 sample squares in England with Wales, and in Scotland. 14 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007) The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey Developments of the ITE Land Classification for Countryside Survey 2007      Prior to the 2007 Countryside Survey, it became apparent that in addition to the requirement for Scotland-only  results (provided for in the 2000 Land Classification) further adjustments were required to accommodate  Wales-only results.  Since devolution, there has been an increasing need for the National Assembly of Wales  and environmental organisations to have access to habitat status and change information on a Wales-only  basis in order to meet the requirements of country-specific environmental policy and legislation.      Welsh-only Estimates    The adjustments in CS2000 included the addition of some Welsh squares, bringing their number up to 64, and  making Wales the most intensively sampled of the three individual countries (England 0.22%, Scotland 0.24%  and Wales 0.29% of total land area). However, in regard to the precision of national estimates, which depends  on absolute numbers rather than proportions, the number of field survey squares in Wales is low compared to  the number in Scotland (203) and England (302).   A scoping report in 200642 concludes that the existing  number of 64 squares in Wales was not adequate for Wales-only reporting for the 2007 survey.  As a consequence, the following changes were made to the 2000 sampling framework for 2007:  •  Class sub-divisions – the ITE Land Classes have been sub-divided into the ‘country unit’ (England and  Wales) versions of the original land classes creating five new classes: 5w, 6w, 7w,15w,18w  •  Number of classes - the effect of the class sub-divisions is to create 45 strata instead of the earlier 40  •  Additional squares – to ensure that there is adequate representation of new classes in Wales, a total of  43 additional squares were surveyed in Wales, this gives a minimum of 6 squares in each Welsh class.  •  Additional squares in England to compensate for the removal of Welsh squares were not warranted.   Two of the English Classes (5e, 15e) are left with only 4 squares per class, however, the 2006 scoping  study42 states the reduction in precision of English estimates is relatively small and the small number of  squares in these classes should still be adequate for reporting purposes.

Estimates for GB for example can be  calculated either using the latest classification (effectively three separate classifications for the three countries)  or the original (1990) classification.  For consistency with in an individual survey the former approach is  preferred whilst the latter is more consistent across surveys’.

ECOLOGICAL SURVEY OF CUMBRIA  HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS  County Planning Department, Kendal Institute of Terrestrial Ecology,  Merlewood  April, 1975 COR Sarppgay se  bet hina ronal ow Coa  #  ee »aenet : ECOLOGICAL SURVEY OF CUMBRIA HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS  Preface  The purpose of this handbook is to inform you of the background to this summer's survey, to explain its purpose, and to give a detailed account of the methods involved in the survey.  Introduction  Cumbria is over 7,000 sq. km. in extent having been reborn on  1 April 197) by the amalgamation of the old counties of Cumberland and Westmorland, the Furness area of Lancashire and the north western extremity of the Yorkshire Dales National Park. Its  centre consists of the Lake District National Park, covering approximately a third of the County. Existing Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) are the Arnside/Silverdale area on the southern boundary, and the Solway Coast. ‘The North Pennines area, consisting of the Cross Fell Escarpment overlooking the Eden Valley, is a proposed AONB.  The topography, geology, climate and land use throughout the County is diverse enabling it to be subdivided into reasonably uniform areas on physical grounds, These areas are not coincident with the administrative boundaries which subdivide the County into six district council areas. The centre is dominated by the high, rocky fells of the Lake District with their steep slopes on Borrowdale Volcanic Rocks. The other highland area is the North Pennines on Carboniferous limestone, with a much flatter moorland top. The Eden Valley runs NNE between these two areas from Appleby to Carlisle and is predominantly a dairy farming region. The sub= coastal fringes of the County cover a large area to the north, whilst the coast proper can be sub-divided into coastal and estuarine areas, such as Morecambe Bay, the Solway Firth and the  Duddon Estuary.  Background to the survey  One of the functions of the County Council is to produce a Structure Plan for the County setting out policies for future land use. 2  Nature conservation and the impact of land use upon wild life habitats is a major issue in Cumbria. Before policies can be set  up to deal with this issue information is required on the extent  and nature of wildlife habitats. Information about specific sites  is readily available, there being 200 designated sites of biological/ geological importance (SSSIs and nature reserves) in Cumbria. However, comparable information about the overall ecological situation is not available; and it is this information gap that  the ecological survey of Cumbria is designed to fill.  The survey is being carried out jointly by the Cumbria County Planning Department and the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, with the intention of producing a report for the Structure Plan by March/ April 1976. The Planning Department is supplying most of the staff for the survey and for evaluating the data collected; ITE will provide the computer and laboratory facilities needed.  The ecological survey  The ecological survey is based on methods developed at ITE's Merlewood Research Station for surveys of the semi-natural woodlands of Great Britain and used in a survey of the native pinewoods of Scotland. The methods have been further adopted to regional ecolo- gical surveys and applied to the Lake District National Park and Shetland.  A number of randomly distributed points are marked on a map, and these are taken as the sampling plots for the survey. Each plot,  is visited, anda 200m quadrat is set up. Within this quadrat, all the plants are recorded, a soil pit is dug and@scribed, and information is recorded on the habitats present. After the summer, this data will be analysed, using multivariate techniques, such as ordination, to help establish the range of variation in Cumbria's ecosystems.  Methods Locat the plot  You will be working in pairs on the survey, and the work can be split between yous you will soon develop your own method of working  as a team. 2 The first step will always be to locate the sampling plot you are going to visit. These plots are marked as points on the 6" 0.S. maps which you will have been given. The 16 black plots must be visited; if this is impossible owing to danger to life and limb, or permission to enter the land is refused, then you can substitute the nearest red plot.  Since the plots are distributed in a random manner, it is important that there should be no subjective bias in locating them on the ground, and the plots in the field should be located as accurately as possible from the map. This is done in stages.  (1) Firstly, find an easily-recognisable landscape feature on the map, near the plot to be sampled, which can be readily located in the fields; such a feature could be a sharp bend in a road or track, a fork in a river, the corner of a lake, or any other unambiguous feature.  Go to this control point on the ground.  (111i) Using the map and Silva compass provided, take a bearing from the control point to the plot to be visited. Don't forget to add 10° for magnetic declination.  (iv) Measure the distance from the control point to the plot, using the scale on the Silva compass. This is in 1/l6ths of an inch; 1/16 of an inch on the six inch scale map will equal 18.33 yds on the ground,  (v) -Now pace the exact number of yards measured from the control point, following the correct bearing on the compass, ‘The last pace you take will land your foot exactly in the middle of the plot to be sampled.  You should make allowance if your pace is less than one yard on average (i.e. if your average pace is 2! 6", add on 6" for each pace, or in other words, one extra pace every five).  If you need to pace uphill, you will have to add on extra paces to compensate for this. Thus for slopes of the approximate angle given below, add the given percentages onto the original number of paces, 0° 25° 30° = 35° —s o®  6% 10% 15% 22% 31%  Ph  For example, if the distance from your control point to the plot in  ts 1/16" on the map, (1.e. 18.33 yds on the ground), and it is all up a slope of about 25°, you should add on 1.8 yards, making 20 paces in all.  If this procedure is rigidly adhered to, it will ensure absolute absence of bias in locating the sampling plot. There may be some loss of accuracy (for example due to a slight deviation from the bearing walked, or the paces being slightly longer or shorter than 1 yard), so that the point on the map and the point tn the field  do not correspond exactly. This however, is not important, as long as there has been no subjective bias in locating the plot in the field.  Recording data _in the plot  The basic sampling unit, as mentioned above, is a 200m quadrat. This is set up using the five posts and strings provided. The centre post has a bolt on top, on which is a right-angled cross held on by & wing=-nut. The other four posts are the corner=-poles of the plot, and each has a 10-metre cord tied to it. Hach of these cords can be attached to the centre pole by clips, and they form the diagonals of the plot.  When a quadrat is set up, the centre post should be struck into  the ground at the central point of the plot (which has been paced out as described above). The cross is used to orientate the four diagonals, and spinning it ensures that this orientation is random.  The next stage is to unroll the orange cord from each of the corner posts, and to clip it onto the centre post. The corner post should be carried out by one member of the team until the cord is taut; the other member can use the nails in the right-angled cross to sight onto the corner post, to make sure that it is orientated correctly.  When the cords are stretched out, it will be seen that they have four pieces of coloured rope tied on them at specified distances from the centre. These mark the corners of successively smaller quadrats within, and concentric with, the large 200m“ quadrat. Thus there are five quadrats in all, of respectively hm*, atm, 100m* and 200m. This is illustrated in Figure 1. These five quadrats are the  sampling units for the vegetation.

(Thus point no. 1 (1) 7 on the map is recorded as Stratum no. 1 (1). Plot no. 7).  You should start recording in the smallest quadrat, (the hm quadrat). All _ vascular plants, bryophytes and macrolichens growing on_the soil in this quadrat should be recorded in the space on the or whose identification is dubious, should be put in a polythene bag, clearly labelled with the stratum and plot number, and retained for identification or confirmation. Mosses and lichens not growing  quadrat", Any plants which are not known,  on the soil (e.g. those epiphytic on heather, or growing on rock) are to be ignored.  Next, move out into the 25m quadrat, and repeat this procedure, this time only recording plants which have not occurred in the him quadrats; © then carry on out into each of the three remaining quadrats, each  time only recording plants which have not been found in inner quadrats.  When the presence of all the plants has been recorded, the next thing is to work out a percentage cover-abundance for each species for the full plot. Estimates should be given to the nearest 5h.  If a species is widely scattered, but with less than 5% cover, it should be recorded as 1 in the cover-abundance column. Species occurring only singly or as a few isolated speciments should be recorded as +. It is advisable forboth members of the team to estimate % cover for each species, at least at first and to record the mean value of the two estimates, in order to increase its relia- bility.  The cover=-abundance % of the other categories (rock, water, litter, bare ground and bryophytes ) should be recorded at the bottom of the sheet °  Ignore the column marked "code", This is for use later on when sorting out the data. An example of a completed field sheet is given in Figure 2. ry e  Date  r 6  Recorder  t No  Oot  PL  Stratum Nog — - ~ - 7  - ' 1 t & XY =e ee py =o 7h 4 ape xem ‘ \ _ 4 : ¢ et AGT Fea, fem at u @ % um : ' Lett Leet MINN 8 ore eee Aen yates tem tomer fear. merry tA a a 0 ee Hi, SEmecexm! ” 7 on eee Fe Nps pee | Ale ee RCE OD tle . , * 7 a - 4 ™ ui ? 1 ~*~ 4 rt a We ’ ' i ! can ; 1 I : ; f ey " - . rn : n 1 es ee “ Pualamat w a ey dat 1omgegi =r pa ' ' I f 1 ‘ wot 7 7 ' ‘ § : ; f ‘ : i i ; - , 5 j ‘ ! j : 1 . . 1 Pa I i i H / ' ‘ \ 4 t 7 1 5 I ~ 3 * q cy | ) . : | i 5 - : | : tw i - } 7 . i i 4 : ; 7 ro " } " ne 1 EY : : ' ‘ 1 : : ; 4 , w H * i 1 r i : : , 5, ' 7 ' ’ a t : i 5 ' , F P { : i PeHippihy aire @ cldiey RG™ © “Aiakint gk eam nemcuAalicryal i : i b: 1 : i : a | f dar nenaeitls WE werent serene tment ete aceeRets a Fo : : 77 i : é :  mmo  , os 7 b f : Et J i j - q L. a uh i ~ im “hme Biot Oi Weeios os cs Pd il KS LIA A, . | . | bey 423 ve i] i. - } “i ae f a t H ! ‘ 4 | i Porrenineine is mil DLS US aves © Lape poms er eoaathvme adie HAR tiawe ated ects ne Ft et 1 { | ] “ \ ir it : f | : !

The soil data sheet has been worked out in advance (see Figure 3), and all that you have to do is to cross off those attributes which apply to the profile in question. To expose a profile, dig down as deep as you can with the trowel and collect cores of the soil below this level using the auger. In digging try to disturb the smallest  area possible,  First, it is necessary to distinguish between the different horizons of the soil. The litter layer consists of undecomposed or readily recognisable plant remains. If this 1s present, record the depths between which it is found (attribute 5) and its composition; this  is done by seeing what plant remains you can recognise in the litter (attributes 6-15). If there is standing water in the  soil saturating the litter layer, record attribute 16. If there  is no litter layer, delete this section completely with a diagonal line.  The organic matter layer consists of decomposed plant remains, with no (or virtually no) admixed mineral matter, This may be very shallow, as on some grassland, or very deep, where there is deep peat cover. If this is present, record the depths between which it eccurs. If the peat is deeper than the length of the auger, record .the maximum depth as 75+ cm (75 cm is the length of the auger.)  Colour (attributes 18 = 20): self explanatory.  Decompositions this is a measure of the amount of decay of the  organic matter. To determine this, take a handful of the organic matter and squeeze it in your hand. If only clear water oozes out, record low decomposition (23). If the whole handful oozes out as  a black mush, then the material is completely decomposed (attrib. 21). If blackish or brownish water emerges, record medium decomposition (22). 7  Texture: -Amorphous (2l.) humus rubbed in the fingers will break up into a black smear: if granular (25), it will retain some erumb-like structure when rubbed. Mixed fibrous-amorphous (27)  is an intimate mixture of the two types of organic matter; layered fibrous/amorphous (28) indicates the two types are separate, and  distinctly layered.  Moisture: it will be obvious if the soil is submerged (29). If  a handful of organic matter oozes water without being squeezed it is very wet (30); if it has to be squeezed to expel water, it is wet (31). If no water oozes out on being squeezed, it is damp (32), and if it feels dry, record 33.  If there is no organic matter layer, delete this section.  mineral particles and humus. This layer will often be only poorly developed, It can be distinguished from overlying organic matter by rubbing in the fingers, when mineral particles will be felt, and from underlying mineral matter by the dark colour of the admixed humus. If present, record the depths between which it is found:  if it extends below thedepth of the auger, again record maximum depth as 75+ em.  anic matter layer is an intimate mixture of  Transition with mineral soil: the transition to the underlying mineral soil (if present) can be abrupt (35) or the two layers will gradually blend, with no distinct join between them (36). If there is no underlying mineral soil reached, cross out this section.  Texture: to distinguish clay (37), silt (38), and sand (39), try to roll a lump of soil between your hands into a sausage. If you  cannot succeed, and the roll crumbles, it is sand. If you can, and can, then bend this sausage into the form of a ring, it. is clay, If the sausage breaks when you try to bend it, it is silt. If the  layer consists of pure gravel (particles over 1/8"), record 0.  If more than about 10% of this layer is made-up of stones, record attributes 41 - 3, depending on the texture of thematrix (determined by the sausage test). SOLL DATA iq. Stratum No; 2.

A mottled layer (48) is one where changes in the water level cause alternating aerobic and anaerobic condi- tions, which will lead to deposition of iron oxides in the mineral matter, The mottled appearance is revealed by breaking the soil up in your fingers, when you will see alternating pale and reddish patches, This occurs most commonly in clays.  Moisture: as for the organic layer.  Structures this is the type of aggregation shown by the soil.particles and is determined by breaking the soil in your fingers. If there is no aggregation at all between particles, it is a powder (53). If  the particles aggregate into small lumps (like breadcrumbs) it is  a erumb (5).) and if it stays as a solid lump, it is a clod (55).  (This latter is most typical of clay soils).  Again, if this layer is not present, delete this section.  The leached layer is a pale layer immediately underlying the organic matter layer, and occurs typically in high rainfall areas, where humus and mineral ions are washed down through the soil, to form  a podzol. It will usually be underlain by the weathered mineral layer. If absent, delete this section.  The weathered mineral layer is distinguished from the mixed mine ral/ organic layer by the absence of the dark humus particles adhering  to the mineral particles, If this layer is present, record its depth, and its moisture, texture, colour and structure as for the mixed mineral/organic layer.  The deposition layer (attributes 86 - 89) only occurs where there is a podzol, and it is the layer of deposition of the humus and mineral ions leached from above. If present, record its colour (86 = 87): there may be two layers of different colours, and also whether it is hard (86) or easily broken up (89). If there is no deposition layer, delete this section. ?  The underlying material is that which occurs under all the previous layers. It may not always be easily distinguished from the weathered mineral layer; for example, in the case of a sand underlying a mixed mineral/organic layer, there is no way of telling. In such 4 case, record it as a weathered mineral layer. Usually there will be no problem; record the depth from which it occurs, and the texture (attributes 91 = 97).  If the soil shows any unusual features which are not taken account of in the soil sheet, make a note in the space at the bottom, or sketch a profile. An example of a completed soil sheet is given in Figure 3.  The final stage is to collect a soil sample. This should be taken from the top 10 cm of the soil under the litter layer. Collect enough to fill one of the polythene bags provided. This will be taken back to Merlewood for its pH to be determined along with other measurements (e.g. loss on combustion, mechanical analysis, and possibly some chemical analyses). Label the soil bag with the stratum and plot numbers,  When you have finished, fill the soil pit in again. iv. Habitat data ‘sheet  These two sheets are intended to record various features of the area, some being physical variables and attributes, while others can also be considered in terms of their value as microhabitats for, say, invertebrate life. Yet others record the present management regime of the area,  The first sheet (habitat data) is to record those features found within the plot. The second sheet (main physiographic features within 50m of plot edge) is to record features lying outside the plot, up to a distance of 50m, which may have an effect on the plot itself. When you first start work, it is advisable to pace out 50m, but soon you should get a rough idea of the distance simply by looking. (50m is in fact 23 times the length of the diagonal  of the 200m“ quadrat.  Plot habitats  Record stratum and plot number, as for the other sheets. ‘The slope is measured, using the clino-meter provided, across the plot from the highest to the lowest point, passing through the centre. If one member of the team stands at the highest point, the other can go to the lowest point, and sight along the wooden body of the clinometer, When the plumb line has steadied, hold it in place against the protractor scale and read off the slope. Aspect is  the bearing down this same slope, measured with the silva compass. (Do not read the aspect up the slope).  Roads and boundaries  Note the presence of drystone walling with limestone or other material, and whether or not it has mosses, lichens or both on it (attributes 1 - 6). Attributes 7 - 12 record these same categories but on fallen walls. The condition of hedgerows, when present, is noted; whether they are stock proof or not (15 = 17), their manage- ment (18 - 22), height (23 - 26), gaps present (27 - 28), whether the branches spread to make the hedge more than 9 ft. wide (29), whether outgrowths from the main body of the hedge extend more than 6 ft. into the verge or field (30), whether hedgerow trees (defined as being more than 6 ft. higher than the top of the hedge) are present (31). 13h  The conditioni:of road verges (32 = 34) and the presence of a wire or wooden fence (35) is to be noted, Tracks or roads can be either hardcore (36) or tarmacked (37), footpaths and bridleways (38 - 39)  may be present.  Management  Distinguish buildings which are lived in (0) from those which serve other purposes (41), such as a shop or store, and from ruined ones (42). Dutch barns (13) have only a roof and are distinguished from elosed ones (4). Sheep enclosures may be ruined (46) or used (45), “wood" is an error it should read "used". A clamp is an earth and straw covered store for root vegetables (17). Silage (50) can be stored in a pit or tower or in large polythene bags. A midden (51) is a manure heap, old ones have dense nettles growing out of a pile or rocks, Ploughing (56) must be recent with no crops growing; drain lines (57) indicate arti- ficial drainage. Domestic rubbish (58) covers anything of household opigin, beer cans ete. Other rubbish (59) is anything else (ferti- liser bags, scrapped machinery, etc.)  Grassland from which livestock are excluded are hayfields (60), pasture (61) supports grazing animals. If there are droppings of any sort present, at average density of about Bm or less record few (65), if more than i. record many (66),  Vegetation habitats  Nardus grassland (67) is dominated by mat-grass (Nardus stricta), Agrostis-fescue (68) is grassland dominated by fescues and bents. Molinia can form tussocks (69) or a sward (70) as can Sphagnum  (75 = 76), and tussocks must be at least lm across to be recorded. Dense heather (71) and bilberry (72) must cover at least 26m” to  be recorded, Bogs dominated by cotton grass (Eriophorum spp.) (73) or rushes (714) must similarly cover 25m" to be recorded, similarly  with bracken (77). Attributes 78 - 80 cover any bryophyte growing on soil, rock and peat. Aquatic bryophytes (81) grow in still or  running water. Spring bryophytes (82) cover any bryophytes growing around the area of a spring. All lichens on soil, rock and peat should be recorded (83 =- 85). Epiphytic lichens grow on other plants, i.e. trees, shrubs, Calluna, bryophytes, etc. Clumps of Plot No.  6. Aspect  .

If obvious traces of burning are present among the vegetation (e.g. ashes, charred heather) record this as recent burning (93). If there are no signs of burning evident among the vegetation, but traces are found in the top soil or among the surface litter (e.g. fragments of charcoal), record past bruning (9).  Record the height of the ground vegetation (95 = 97) and the overall height (98 = 100),  Woodland habitats  Scrub woodland (101) consists of bushes and saplings with trees not greater than 10 ft. in height. If the woodlandconsists solely of conifers record 102, if of broad leaves record 103, for mixtures of the two record 10). A grove is dominated by one species and should only be recorded if it covers about 28m (105 ~ 107). Glades are clearings in woodland of grass (108) or of mixed grass/herbs (109). Shrubs such as hazel and dogwood are recorded as 110, A young plantation (111) can comprise either conifers or broadleaves, and  is recorded if the trees in it have not closed canopy. Underplanted areas (112) usually consist of a broadleaved canopy species under- planted with conifers, usually western hemlock. Felled (113) and coppiced (11).) areas are obvious, as are ivy (115), epiphytes (116 - 117) and macro fungi; (118 - 119). ‘The presence of dead trees and piles of wood (120 = 126) should be recorded.  Ground habitats  127 = 129 must be solid outerops, and not loose boulders (as far as can be defined), A rock ledge (130) is a horizontal surface of any size on a rock outcrop or ¢liff., A seree (131) is fairly obvious:  it must be at least 20m" and be unstable. This also includes man made screes caused by earth moving operations. Stones, rocks and boulders (132 - 134) are loose rocks lying on the ground, distinguis- hed by size. Rock piles (135) must be at least 1m high and can be artificial or natural. Rock patterns (136) are regular patterns made by rocks, due to such features as creep, Wind and/or frost. They usually take the form of alternate strips of rock and turf. Stone, rock and boulder fields (137 - 139) are areas where at least 50% of the ground area is covered by loose rocks; (as in 132-134). A gully (140) is the space between two rock outcrops facing one another. A gorge (11) is the same but deeper than 50m. A dell/hollow covering more ‘than are is recorded as 12, if leaf filled record lui. The presence of mossy rocks is recorded as 143. Eroding  bank, peat and mineral soil (145 - 147) is obvious; the extent of the erosion must be at least lm~ to be recorded, A bank (148 -  150) has only one slope whereas an embankment (151) has two,  forming a ridge above the level of its surroundings. Quarries  and mines (152 - 15.) are obvious. Sheep scrapes (155) are crescent shaped gouges cut into the soil of hill sides by the burrowing  action of sheep in search of shelter.  Aquatic habitats  Streams and rivers are divided into ] categories based on size and speed of flow, 157 = 159 are incorrect and should read as followss-  157 Stream> 2 ft.  158 Stream, fast  159 Stream, slow  Slow and fast streams are distinguished as those flowing slower or faster than 1 mph, i.e. a slow walking pace.  If a stream is present in the plot, then the nature of its bed should be recorded (160 = 165); as should the presence of shingle banks (166), pools (167 - 168), waterfalls (169) and weirs (170).  If there is a definite spring emerging from the ground it should be recorded as 172 or 173. If, however, there is only a slight ooze of water, without it forming a definite spring, record it as a seepage (L7L)«  Freshwater bodies are recorded as 3 size classes (17 = 176); reservoirs are recorded as 177.  A lake shore (178) is the area of land submerged by changes in water level of the lake, The presence of emergent vegetation is recorded as 179. A riverbank (180) edges a stream ? 2 ft. in width, whereas a streambank (182) edges a stream¢2 ft. in width, and is distinct from a river cutting (181) in being cut by natural erosion rather than by man. A canalised river or canal (19) has reinforced sides. The marine habitats are obvious enough (183 - 188), a saltmarsh (188) differing from intertidal mud (187) in only being covered by the highest tides and having a vegetation cover. 1h Other habitats If a peat-cutting has become flooded to a depth of at least 6", record it as drowned (189), An island (191) is vegetated and can occur in any river or pond, although it must cover at least Sm to be recorded. An artificial ditch or drain should be recorded as wet (192) or dry (193). 1  MAIN PHYSIOGRAPHIC FEATURES WITHIN 50m OF PLOT EDGE  This sheet is designed to cover features which are larger than 200m, The quadrat, for instance, might be located in the bottom of a scree so that this fact would not be recorded in the other habitat sheet.  Definitions of the features are the same as for the other habitat sheet. A young conifer plantation (22) differs from an old one (23) in not having been thinned and not having closed its canopy.  ae as, MAIN PHYSIOGRAPHIC FEATURES WITHIN 50M OF PLOT EDGE  iL.

Make sure you have entered the stratum and plot numbers on all | sheets, and that the sheets have been fully filled in. Check that you have taken a soil sample, and that this, and any unidentified plants you have collected, are in polythene bags labelled clearly with stratum and plot number. Make certain that you have collected together all your equipment and samples into the rucksack. You can now move onto the next plot, and start the whole procedure all over again.  When you have finished for the day code the species you have found using the codes listed overleaf. Any species which are not on the list should be given a new code, which should be communicated to  other groups as soon as possible. 17 Appendix 1  List of survey equipment provided lL set plotemarking equipment  1 trowel |  2 recording boards and pencils Data sheets  ruler  1 soil auger and handle  1 Silva compass  Ll -eclinome ter  Polythene bags  Aluminium labels (for polythene bags)  Maps 18  Appendix 2 Code Species Code Species LL AAA Se es teers pests Peete tn ce ttt intense snaps bess othe tegen uh Achillea millefolium ag Cryptogramma crispa. 2 Acer pseudoplatanus 30 Dactylis glomerata,. 8 Agrostis tenuis elk Digitalis purpurea hh Anthoxanthum coratum 32 Deschamps ia caespitosa. 5 Alchemilla glabra 33 Deschampsia Plexuosa. 6 Bellis perennis 3h Dryopteris felix- MAS o 7 Blechnum spicant 35 Drosera rotundifolia 8 Betula pendula 36 Epilobium palustre 9 Betula pubescens _ a7 Eriophorum angus tifolium 10 Crataegus monogyna 38 Eriophorum vaginatum ai Cerastium vulgatum 39 Filipendula ulmaria 12 Cirsium vulgare ho Fraxinus excelsior 3 Cirsium arvense hh Festuca ovina 1h Centaurea nigra h2 Festuca rubra 15 Corylus avellana h3 Galium aparine 16 Cynosurus cristatus hh Galium saxatile 17 Cardamine pratensis hs Geum urbanum 18 Chamaenerion angustifolium 6 Geranium robertianum 19 Chrysanthemum leucanthemum 7 Holcus lanatus 20 Campanula rotundifolia h8 Heracleum sphondyllum 21, Conopodium major hg Hedera helix 22 Cirsium palustre 50 Ilex aquifolium 23 Carex panicea 51 Juncus effusus 2h Carex binervis 52 Juncus conglomeratus 25 Carex nigra 53 Juncus squarrosus 26 Carex echinata Sh Lolium perenne 27 Carex flacca 55 Lonicera pericly- menum 28 Calluna vulgaris 56 Lotus corniculatus 19  Code _.

The data was derived  from satellite data collected by the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper. Data can be provided for  any area of the country, under Licence, and is used for a wide variety of applications by  business, government and researchers. Data from the map provides:   • the first complete map of the land cover of Great Britain since the 1960s    • the first time the land cover of Great Britain has been comprehensively mapped from  satellite information    • the first digital map of national land cover   • accuracy to the field scale, checked against ground survey      The Land Cover Map comprises 25 classes, including sea and inland waters, bare,  suburban and urban areas, arable farmland, pastures and meadows, rough grass, grass  heaths and moors, bracken, dwarf shrub heaths and moorland, scrub, deciduous and  evergreen woodland, and upland and lowland bogs. It can be used to plan, manage or  monitor agriculture, ecology, conservation, forestry, environmental assessment, water  supplies, urban spread, transport, telecommunications, recreation and mineral extraction.  Current examples of the application of the Land Cover Map include detection of changing  land cover, landscape management, mapping bracken in the context of health studies  (bracken supports ticks carrying human disease), environmental assessments of motorway  extensions, and planning of  telecommunication lines.      Introduction    The Land Cover Map of Great Britain (LCMGB) was produced using supervised maximum  likelihood classifications of Landsat Thematic Mapper data (Fuller et al. 1994a). The map,  based on a 25m grid, records 25 cover types, consisting of sea and inland water, beaches  and bare ground, developed and arable land, and 18 types of semi-natural vegetation -  these are described more fully below. By combining summer and winter data, classification  accuracies were substantially improved over single-date analyses (Fuller et al. 1994b). In  all, 88% of Britain was classified from combined summer-winter images, and 12% from  single-date, mostly summer, data. Just 0.4% of Britain was obscured by cloud cover on  both summer and winter images. The missing areas of offshore islands represent just  0.1% of Britain. This document aims to give details about the map classes, the map's  resolution and the way in which classes are depicted. Further details, which relate the map  and its cover types to the results of other surveys, are given by Wyatt et al. (1994).        Spatial resolution & registration    It has been suggested (Townshend, 1983) that the minimum accurately map-able unit  from TM data would be of the order of 3 to 5ha. In practice, in the LCMGB, most features  of 1ha show clearly, giving a map which records patterns at a field by field scale.   Superimposed on this 'minimum accurately map-able area' is a finer pattern of those  smaller features with strong enough spectral signatures to discriminate them from the  background cover: for example, roads, farms, shelter belts, water bodies and grass tracks  are evident throughout the cover maps. After removal of isolated pixels, these are shown  in units as small as 2 pixels (0.125 ha) (Fuller et al. 1994a).    Registration of the Landsat-derived raster maps to 143 vector field-maps of 1km squares  showed average displacement to be 0.8 pixels (20m): 75 out of 143 squares needed no  shift to achieve correspondence with vector overlays; 43 squares needed a one pixel shift;  15 squares needed 2 pixels movement and only 10 squares needed more than 2 pixels 4 movement relative to the vectors (Fuller et al. 1994a). This positional error is fully  acceptable for most applications of the data.        Classification accuracy    Quality checks require access to 'ground truth data', but the accuracy of such data is  rarely known (Congalton, 1991). Conventional maps are most commonly used, but their  division of a continuum of landscape patterns into discrete classes, with hard boundaries is  not 'truth' but an artificial generalization, which achieves different results according to the  rules and methods employed. A recent study has revealed the wide variations in  definitions of land cover (Wyatt et al., 1994). In assessing the LCMGB, it is important to  note that the reference surveys also set out with different methods, different objectives  and also differing potential in terms of the details they could record. Comparisons can only  give indications as to LCMGB accuracy but they help point to sources of error and highlight  the impacts of generalization and class definition.     Comparisons with independent ground reference data, for 508 1km squares, showed  correspondences which varied depending on the level of detail at which comparisons were  made. Many of the apparent discrepancies are due to significant differences in class  definitions. Whereas the Landsat classification, like the Ordnance Survey, used a  hydrological definition of bogs (see later), the field survey used a botanical definition  which, in contrast, included wet moorlands. There were also differences in how the two  surveys divided the continuum from grass, through heather-grass mixtures, to dense  shrub heaths. There were differences, too, in dividing the continuum from rough  grasslands to managed swards. There are no fixed conventions in such divisions and  variations can arise between individual surveyors within a survey: a quality assurance  exercise, which re-examined the 1km field data, showed an average 84% correspondence  when the original surveyors' coding of land cover was compared with a quality standard.  Allowing for different definitions, the overall correspondence between field and LCMGB  samples is 67%.    The biggest component of map error is likely to be the misclassification of mixed boundary  pixels. Some 40% of all pixels adjoin or cross a vector boundary and were thus made up  of mixed cover types and additional boundary features. Correspondence was raised to  71% when boundary pixels were excluded. There are minor discrepancies due to  geometry, where a feature was correctly classified but slightly displaced. In dissected  landscapes this would have had a major impact. It is desirable, though not easy, to  distinguish between misclassification and mis-registration. The satellite-derived map might  be an accurate measure of cover, pattern and relative distribution, but with minor spatial  differences relative to equivalent products.     Other differences reflect changes in cover between surveys, sometimes 2 years apart. For  example, a pasture on one date, ploughed on the other. If we allow for likely time-based  changes, overall correspondence is measured at 76% including boundary pixels, or 82%  excluding boundaries.     Users of the data should be aware that these observations represent average error-rates.  As with any average, the value represents a combination of lower and higher figures. Local  discrepancies may be observed which seem to suggest higher or lower accuracy rates: this  is only to be expected.    As previously noted, no survey could have delivered the 'ground truth' needed for exact  validation; but it is possible to assess the probable meaning of results summarised here.  If, as seems likely, the original CS90 field survey was close to the quality assurance  survey and each 'correctly' recorded 90-95% of the landscape, they would have  overlapped by around the measured 84%. If the Landsat survey achieved 80-85% success  (a figure regularly achieved in pilot studies (Fuller et al., 1989a; b, Parsell, 1990)), then 5 the correspondence with the field survey would have been around 67-71%. These are the  range of figures obtained if we allow for the obvious interpretation differences, with an  element of temporal change. In conclusion, a realistic assessment of Land Cover Map  accuracy is probably 80-85%.    For more details on accuracies see Fuller et al. (1994a) and Wyatt et al. (1994). Note too  that a publication is in preparation which evaluates the correspondences between ground  and satellite surveys in far greater detail.

LCM 1990 classes   Introduction  The following descriptions outline the ITE Landsat-derived cover types used in the Land  Cover Map of Great Britain. The choice of classes represents a compromise between what  would be ideal for wide-ranging users, and what was feasible to map, at this scale, from  remote sensing datasets. The classes chosen represent an aggregation of many  subclasses: for example, wheat, barley and oilseed rape are subclasses of the 'arable'  class. These subclasses have been reduced to a short-list of target 'classes' which are  considered ecologically meaningful, consistently recognisable from the selected imagery,  and realistic in terms of their likely accuracy. It would be possible to recombine subclasses  differently, for example a map of 'graminoids' might be produced by aggregating all grass  subclasses, including natural grasslands, agricultural pastures and arable cereals. Very  likely, specialist users will require a 'tailor-made' aggregation to meet specific objectives,  and this could be done digitally, by reference to the original maps of subclasses. Such  users would have to accept that subclasses might not be distinguished consistently (e.g.  not all images were of appropriate date to separate, for example, wheat from barley within  the arable class).    The descriptions aim to record any limitations which would prevent further subdivisions to  consistent standards. All classes are subject to the provision that they are only mapped if  they are above the minimum map-able size, namely two pixels, i.e. 0.125ha, though in  practice it cannot be said that all 0.125 ha features are shown - this will depend on how  strong the spectral signature of a feature is and how pixels fall with respect to that  feature. Minimum consistently map-able area could be 5 ha (Townshend 1983). In  practice, the real value is probably between these two extremes, and perhaps nearer to  1ha. 6   At present, the list distinguishes lowland and upland categories which are similar, for  example lowland heather and upland dwarf shrub. These classes have spectral  characteristics which allow their separation, but not with the same level of accuracy as  would be available in separating classes with entirely different characteristic species.  Regional upland and lowland masks have been created from the cover-classes and  coarsely filtered in order to generalise the classification into lowland and upland types.  Some users may feel that other measures of context (e.g. altitude) are better criteria for  separation, in which case such separations are best made in a geographical information  system (GIS).    Agricultural grassland subdivisions have been taken further than spectral signatures may  justify, because of the importance and extent of agricultural swards (see later). The  situation with grasslands is complex: in addition to the interplay of species and altitude,  there are extra difficulties imposed by soil-acidity, wetness and, more especially, by  complex and ever-changing patterns of grassland-management. In the continua from  lowland to upland, from wet to dry, from basic to acid soils and from natural to intensively  managed, many classes might be identified. Agriculturalists and conservationists may not  necessarily define the same classes, nor would a class be consistent from one agricultural  region to another - a rough pasture in SE England might be considered to be good in  montane Scotland for example. It is also true that discrete classes may not be spectrally  separable, especially where management (e.g. mowing) obscures the characteristic  appearance of the various components. Those classes which are defined here are thought  to be ecologically meaningful and separable with good reliability. They are, most  importantly, intended to be consistent throughout Britain.      How to use this class description  This class description document is structured in terms of the two levels of classification at  which the Land Cover Map of Great Britain is being made available as a standard digital  product: as either the full set of 25 'target' cover-types, or as an aggregation of these into  17 'key' cover-types.  The 25 classes are those provided as standard in the 25m spatial resolution data; the 17  classes are those provided as standard in the 1km summary data. In the former, there is  just one layer of data, with values or 'labels' between 0 and 25 representing the  designated cover type of each 25 x 25 m grid cell. In the 1 km summary data there are 17  layers, one for each 'key' class. Each layer records the cover for one 'key' class. The values  for each 1 km grid cell represent the proportion of that cell that has been designated as  being of a particular key cover-type. So, layer 1 holds the cover per 1 km cell for 'key'  class A, layer 2 the summary cover data for 'key' class B, etc. This proportion is expressed  as an integer percentage value, e.g. if 320 of the original 1600 25m cells within a  particular 1 km cell were of key cover-type G (marsh/rough grass) then the layer for this  class would have a value of 20 (%) for this 1 km cell in the 1 km summary data. (As  indicated in the Introduction it is also possible to provide non-standard 'customised' data,  e.g. the 25m data could be provided as the 17 key cover-types, rather than as the 25  target cover- types.)  In the 1 km summary data the integer percentage values are presented class by class and  these may be thought of as distinct sets or 'bands' of data. The second column of Table 1  shows that in the full 17 class data set the order of these bands follows that of the letters  A - Q. If a subset of the 17 key cover-types was requested then the corresponding band  numbers would change, e.g. if data for only classes B, G, M and Q were requested then  these would be bands 1, 2, 3 &mp; 4 respectively. 7 A - SEA/ESTUARY  This category includes all open sea and coastal waters, including estuaries, normally inland  to the point where the waterway is constricted to 1 pixel or its continuity is broken by a  bridging point. An exception is where waterways open up again into major estuarine  features, such as Breydon water near Great Yarmouth or many of the sea lochs on the  north-west Scottish coast. The division will be immediately evident by reference to  classmaps. It is not intended to accurately show the limit of saline or tidal waters, which  may extend much further inland.  Fuller key-name: Sea, coastal waters and estuaries, inland to the first bridging point or  barrier.  This category carries the label '1' in the 25 'target' class dataset.      B - INLAND WATER  Inland water includes all map-able fresh waters and any estuarine waters which are  excluded in the above category. The maps record only those areas which are water- covered on both the winter and summer images. Thus, reservoirs with summer draw- down, or winter-flooded meadows are classified to the summer class (i.e. bare or  grassland in these examples).  Fuller key-name: inland fresh waters and estuarine waters above the first bridging point or  barrier.  This category carries the label '2' in the 25 'target' class dataset.      C - COASTAL BARE GROUND (BEACH / MUDFLATS / CLIFFS)  The coastal bare ground category includes intertidal mud, silt, sand, shingle and rocks. It  also includes bare maritime habitats above the tide-line, such as shingle beaches, mobile  sand dunes and bare rocks or soil of coastal cliffs. A covering of sparse vegetation, such as  pioneer salt marsh, dune or shingle species will not put the beach into a vegetated class  unless the majority of the substratum is covered.  Distinction of this cover type is dependent on the level of the tide on the days of imaging  (the lower tide being used to define the lower limit of the beach). Thus discrepancies can  arise where high tides prevailed on imaging.  Fuller key-name: bare coastal mud, silt, sand, shingle and rock, including coastal accretion  and erosion features above high water.  This category carries the label '3' in the 25 'target' cover-type digital data set.      D - SALTMARSH  Areas of seaweeds are sometimes sufficiently extensive to show as vegetated intertidal  plant communities. The may comprise the green alga Enteromorpha intestinalis or the  brown wracks (Pelvetia caniliculata, Fucus spp. and Ascophyllum nodosum) growing on  rocks, boulders and sometimes gravels, sands and muds. Saltmarshes are intertidal sand-,  silt- or mud-based habitats, colonised by halophytic grasses such as Puccinellia spp, and  herbs such as Limonium spp., Aster tripolium and Triglochin maritima. They remain mostly  green in winter. For the purposes of this classmap, only those marshes up to normal high  water spring tides (i.e. those flooded monthly) are included. The upper saltmarsh,  inundated only on extreme high-water spring tides, is dominated by coarse grasses such  as Agropyron spp.. These are classified accordingly as marsh / rough grass (see below).  Distinction of this cover type is dependent on the level of the tide on the days of imaging  (the lower tide being used to define the lower limit of the seaweed beds or saltmarshes).  Thus discrepancies can arise where high tides prevailed on imaging.  Fuller key name: intertidal seaweed beds and saltmarshes up to normal levels of high  water spring tides.  This category carries the label '4' in the 25 'target' class dataset. 8 E - ROUGH PASTURE / DUNE GRASS / GRASS MOOR  There are potential problems of confusion between lowland grass heaths and upland grass  moors, largely because the species complements are similar. However, there are sufficient  differences that spectral separation may be reliable. It has also proved possible to  separate the two using a digital mask to correct regional misclassifications (see  introduction). Some users of the maps and data may choose to aggregate the two classes,  for later separation in a GIS, but using their own contextual definition based on altitude,  climate, latitude and longitude or combinations of any such variables.    Grass Heath  This class includes coastal dunes and inland grasslands typically growing on sandy soils,  usually acid in character. The species might include, on coastal dunes, Ammophila  arenaria, Festuca rubra and Carex arenaria and a wide variety of herbaceous species,  often winter annuals. Inland, and on mature 'grey' dunes, all but Ammophila might be  present, but acid-loving species are typical, including Festuca ovina, Agrostis spp. and  Deschampsia flexuosa set in a carpet of lichens and mosses (Duffey et al. 1974). The  latter species are also characteristic of marginal hill-grasslands and a zone of semi-natural  acid grassland may lie between the agricultural grasslands of lower hill-slopes and  moorland communities on the hill tops. These swards are characteristic of north-western  Britain, mostly on land between 100-200 m, but right down to sea level in north-west  Scotland.  In winter, the lowland grass heaths have substantial quantities of dead plant litter,  distinguishing the lowland grass heaths from agricultural swards, but the litter content is  less than is typical of coarse rough grasslands, offering a spectral distinction from these.  Fuller key-name: semi-natural, mostly acid, grasslands of dunes, heaths and lowland- upland margins This category carries the label '5' in the 25 'target' class dataset.    Moorland Grass  This class includes upland swards, mostly of deciduous grasslands, often referred to as  grass moorland or upland grassy heath. They are typically dominated by Nardus stricta  and/or Molinia caerulea, with Festuca ovina, Deschampsia caespitosa, Juncus spp. often  including sparse cover of upland dwarf shrubs. These swards form large tracts of mostly  unenclosed hill-grasslands, lightly grazed often by sheep.  Fuller key-name: montane/hill grasslands, mostly unenclosed Nardus/Molinia moorland.  This category carries the label '9' in the 25 'target' class dataset.      F - PASTURE / MEADOW / AMENITY GRASS  Agricultural grasslands comprise many types, from newly sown leys, of single species, to  largely unimproved swards of indigenous species. This range is subdivided in many  different ways by the many different surveys of grasslands (see Fuller 1987). Here we  must be constrained by what is possible, with acceptable accuracy, using satellite imaging.  Certainly, the class 'pasture/meadow/amenity grass' can be identified with good  consistency. It characteristically forms a cropped sward, comprising finer grass species (eg  Festuca, Agrostis, Lolium and Poa spp.) often with many other grasses and herbs. The  sward is maintained by mowing and/or grazing, such that coarser species of grass, herbs  and scrub cannot become dominant.  In agricultural and conservation terms, there is an important distinction between  'improved' and 'unimproved' swards. Improvement may involve reseeding, herbicide  treatments, and/or fertiliser applications which promote the growth of 'preferred' species,  especially Lolium perenne. Swards which are essentially 'unimproved', or which have  reverted, contain a dominant proportion of indigenous species (Fuller 1987).  Improved pastures or close-mown amenity swards are mostly distinguishable on satellite  imagery: they remain green in both summer and winter. Unimproved swards are generally  used at a low intensity and are typically unenclosed. They are also likely to be discernible  from intensive pastures because of their rougher texture, their weed content and the  quantity of plant litter they carry in winter (all factors which affect overall reflectance). The  problem is that hay meadows, of both the lowlands and the partially improved lower 9 slopes of upland areas, could be confused with either improved or unimproved swards,  depending on the stage of management in the particular year of imaging e.g. growing hay,  standing hay, cut hay, aftermath- grazed. This obviously depends on the date of the image  available for classification (and only days may separate the four types).  The 25 class classification identifies two types of pasture/meadow/amenity grass, which  are be retained as separate class numbers in the database, but could be aggregated to a  single colour- class for map and data outputs, depending on the measured accuracy and  user requirements. It should be realised that the classes are readily inter-changeable by  changing management practices, and such changes may take place on a cyclical basis  (e.g.  where  swards  are  mown  one  year  grazed  another).  The  two  pasture/meadow/amenity grass subclasses are described below.    Mown / Grazed Turf  Mown/grazed turf grasslands are managed either as agriculturally productive swards or  mown as amenity grasslands. They are mostly agriculturally 'improved' by reseeding  and/or fertiliser use and would normally contain high quantities of Lolium perenne and/or  other preferred species. Their key characteristic is that they did not, at either date of  imaging (summer or winter), have any detectable quantity of dead plant material, nor a  substantial uncropped stand of living material. This implies that the swards were grazed or  cut and thus maintained as a turf throughout the growing period. This management  prevented the sward from reaching flowering height in summer and ensured that there  was little or no standing crop of plant litter to influence the winter-reflectance of the  sward.  Fuller key-name: pastures and amenity swards, mown or grazed, to form a turf  throughout the growing season.  This category carries the label '6' in the 25 'target' class dataset.    Meadow / Verge / Semi-natural swards  Meadows and verges include grasslands which are managed, but mostly at a lesser  intensity than the 'mown/grazed turf' class. Partial improvement favours productive  species such as Lolium perenne, and herbicide treatment may reduce the content of  broadleaved 'weeds' but some of the swards in this category represent the traditional hay  meadows which have escaped improvement. The swards may be mown for hay and  perhaps aftermath- grazed.  Semi-natural swards may have much the same appearance. Festuca/Agrostis swards are  typical of the indigenous, essentially unimproved grasslands, of neutral to acid soils,  mostly enclosed, formerly covering much of Britain's grazing land, but now restricted to  upland margins and odd pockets of lowlands, usually on floodplains. The swards are  characterised by Festuca rubra and ovina, Agrostis stolonifera, A. tenuis and/or A. canina,  often with substantial quantities of rushes (Juncus spp.), sedges (Carex spp.) and  broadleaved plants. Alternatively, the semi-natural grasslands may be agriculturally non- productive swards which are managed by occasional cutting to prevent excessive weed or  scrub growth, e.g. roadside verges, country parks, golf course semi-rough areas.  The key characteristic of this class is that the swards were not a short-cropped turf  throughout the year - either they were grazed at low intensity such that patches of  unpalatable species became sufficiently dominant to produce a higher standing crop than  on pastures. Or the swards were used for hay and appeared as a long grass sward  awaiting mowing or grazing: or, perhaps, they had recently been mown for hay. The  important characteristic is that they were cropped by the time of winter imaging, to  remove much of the standing crop of grass. Thus, by winter they were mostly green rather  than a straw- coloured stand of plant-litter as would be typical of natural swards of coarse  grasses. This class forms a transition, often in appearance, perhaps in species contents  and productivity, often in terms of time (i.e. improving or reverting) and especially space  (a transition zone), between improved pastures and the 'natural' grasslands of heaths and  moors.  Fuller key-name: Meadows, verges, low intensity amenity grasslands and semi-natural  cropped swards, not maintained as a short turf.  This category carries the label '7' in the 25 'target' class dataset. 10 G - MARSH / ROUGH GRASS  In the 25 class data the marsh/rough grass category comprises three types, separated to  distinguish established rough swards from new colonisation. In the 17 class list these are  amalgamated.    Ruderal weed  The ruderal weed cover-type is generally bare ground being colonised by annual and  short- lived perennial plants, usually with a considerable remnant of bare ground,  especially in winter. The ground may be naturally bare, e.g. shingle beaches, or  abandoned arable land, e.g. set-aside, or derelict industrial works such as demolished  factories, gravel pits etc. This category is rarely extensive enough to map, was chosen to  classify what might have been extensive areas of set-aside, and is aggregated with the  rough grass class for maps and most data summaries.  Fuller key-name: ruderal weeds colonising natural and man-made bare ground.  This category carries the label '19' in the 25 'target' class dataset.    Felled Forest  Recently felled forest, usually with large quantities of brush-wood etc, comprise this class.  As they re-vegetate, felled areas re-colonise with ruderal weeds, and then become rough  grassland. Although originally selected in the anticipation that they would be relatively  commonplace, felled areas are rare. They will be aggregated with 'marsh / rough grass'  class for most display purposes and data-summaries.  Fuller key-name: felled forest, with ruderal weeds and rough grass.  This category carries the label '23' in the 25 'target' class dataset.    Rough / Marsh Grass  This class includes lowland herbaceous vegetation of fens, marshes, upper saltmarshes,  and rough or derelict ground. The characteristic feature of this category is that the swards  are not significantly cropped by mowing or grazed by stock. In fact most are unenclosed  grasslands, abandoned from economic use. The result is that they have a high standing  crop of vegetation, most of which dies back in winter, leaving a dense plant litter.  Fuller key-name: lowland marsh/rough grasslands, mostly uncropped and unmanaged,  forming grass and herbaceous communities, of mostly perennial species, with high winter- litter content.   This category carries the label '8' in the 25 'target' class dataset.      H - GRASS / SHRUB HEATH  In the 25 class dataset open shrub heath and open shrub moor are kept separate. In the  17 class data they are aggregated into one class.    Open Shrub Heath  This category complements the above moorland variety of grass /shrub heath. However,  because intensive grazing of lowland heaths is no longer practised, the incidence of this  class is rare. It will be found where knowledge-correction has identified an area of the  grass / shrub heath mixture as being in a lowland zone.  Fuller key-name: lowland, dwarf shrub/grass heathland.  This category carries the label '25' in the 25 'target' class dataset.    Open Shrub Moor  This cover type is fairly commonplace on some marginal hill grazing land, especially in  northern and western parts of Britain, where grazing prevents the dominance of dwarf  shrub species. It is also extensive in Calluna moorland, as a result of moor-burning to  maintain young heather regrowth to promote grouse populations. Initial regrowth  produces grassy swards, which over a period of years revert to heather-cover. As the  heather senesces, so moorland is re-burnt, with a repeat cycle of perhaps 10 years.  Whereas other transient cover-features of management (e.g. haycutting, arable crop-type)  are not defined because of their short-lived nature, the 10-year cycle is judged long 11 enough to justify the distinction between currently managed and unmanaged areas. The  proportionate cover of Calluna which is required to alter the classification from 'burnt' back  to 'dwarf shrub' is not yet clear: this will become evident on comparison of classmaps with  corresponding 1km field squares of Countryside 1990.  Fuller key-name: upland, dwarf shrub/grass moorland.  This category carries the label '10' in the 25 'target' class dataset.      I - SHRUB HEATH  In the 25 class dataset dense shrub heath and dense shrub moor are kept separate. In the  17 class data they are aggregated into one class.    Dense Shrub Heath  Dense shrub heath refers to communities with high contents of heather (Calluna), ling  (Erica spp.) but perhaps mixed with broom (Cytisus scoparius), gorse (Ulex spp.). It is  mostly evergreen, hence different from other scrub communities. Almost invariably, it  represents vegetation on sandy soils, in characteristic sites like the Brecklands, and the  Dorset and Surrey Heaths, or on extensive coastal dune systems.  Fuller key-name: lowland evergreen shrub-dominated heathland.  This category carries the label '13' in the 25 'target' class dataset.    Dense Shrub Moor  The dense shrub moor communities include heather (Calluna vulgaris), ling (Erica spp.)  and bilberry (Vaccinium spp.) moorlands. Though dominated by woody shrubs, these may  be mixed with herbaceous species, especially those of the moorland grass. The dense  shrub moors may be managed by moor-burning, in which case they may be bare, for most  of the first year after burning; then the grass / shrub heath mixture is found until dense  shrub growth again dominates the cover.  Fuller key-name: upland evergreen dwarf shrub-dominated moorland.  This category carries the label '11' in the 25 'target' class dataset.      J - BRACKEN  The bracken class is herbaceous vegetation dominated by Pteridium aquilinum. It may be  upland or lowland, mixed with grass and other species. The obvious characteristic is that  the distinctive colour of winter bracken dominates the reflectance of the community.  Fuller key-name: bracken-dominated herbaceous communities. This category carries  the label '12' in the 25 'target' class dataset.      K - DECIDUOUS / MIXED WOOD  This category comprises all deciduous broadleaved trees, broadleaved and includes mixed  stands, where they cannot be separated spatially. The 25 class data identifies two cover  types.    Scrub / Orchard  Scrub and orchard areas are deciduous, often with substantial herbaceous vegetation.  Typical species include sallow (Salix spp.) in wetlands, or hawthorn (Crataegus  monogyna), brambles (Rubus fruticosus agg.) and saplings or small trees: these include,  of course, fruit trees. Although commonplace, the scrub category is rarely extensive  enough to record more than just a few pixels. The exceptions are in areas of orchards  (though these are only found in a few areas), and in semi-natural vegetation, for example,  the sallow-carr woodlands of the Broads or hawthorn scrub on chalk downland. For map-  production purposes and in most data summaries the scrub and deciduous woodland  classes will be amalgamated.  Fuller key-name: deciduous scrub and orchards.   This category carries the label '14' in the 25 'target' class dataset. 12 Deciduous Woodland  The deciduous characteristic separates it from evergreen species, as it appears bare in  winter. However, deciduous woodland has a unique spectral signature which separates it  from other deciduous vegetation and from arable land. Mixed woodland may be included  with this category, though continuous evergreen stands, where greater than the minimum  map-able area, will be separated.  Fuller key-name: Deciduous broadleaved and mixed woodlands.  This category carries the label '15' in the 25 'target' class dataset.      L - CONIFEROUS / EVERGREEN WOODLAND  Coniferous/evergreen woodland comprises coniferous species (including the deciduous  larch (Larix spp.), plus other evergreens such as holly (Ilex aquifolium), Rhododendron (R.  ponticum), yew (Taxus baccata) or Holm oaks (Quercus ilex). As well as remaining in leaf  all year round, the species generally have very dark leaves or needles, giving them unique  signatures in both summer and winter.  Fuller key-name: Conifer and broadleaved evergreen trees.  This category carries the label '16' in the 25 'target' class dataset.      M - BOG (HERBACEOUS)  Bogs are widespread in upland areas especially to the north and west of Britain. They are  also found locally in lowland areas. They are characterised by permanent water-logging,  resulting in depositions of acidic peat. The 'bogs' of this classification are mostly  herbaceous communities of wetlands with permanent or temporary standing water  (Ordnance Survey maps show the same areas using 'marsh' symbols). Wet heather  moorlands, which botanists may refer to as 'bogs', are not generally mapped as such on  topographic maps (OS maps show them as 'heaths'), and are mapped by this survey as  dwarf shrub categories. As with other heathland and moorland classes in the 25 class data,  a distinction is made between upland and lowland variants of this class.    Lowland bog  Lowland bogs are rare in much of Britain, due to drainage and peat extraction. However,  local large areas of bog are to be found on the west coast of Scotland. They carry most of  the species of upland bogs, but in an obviously lowland context, with Myrica gale and  Eriophorum spp. being highly characteristic.  Fuller key-name: lowland herbaceous wetlands with permanent or temporary standing  water.   This category carries the label '24' in the 25 'target' class dataset.    Upland bog  Upland bogs have many of the species of grass and dwarf shrub heaths and moors, but  are characterised by water-logging, perhaps with surface water, especially in winter. The  water- logging promotes species such as bog myrtle (Myrica gale) and cotton grass  (Eriophorum spp.) in addition to the species of grass and dwarf shrub moorlands.  Fuller key-name: lowland herbaceous wetlands with permanent or temporary standing  water.  This category carries the label '17' in the 25 'target' class dataset.      N - TILLED LAND (ARABLE CROPS)   Tilled land includes all land under annual tillage, especially for cereals, horticulture etc. It  also includes leys in their first year, ie if they were bare at the time of the winter imagery.  Other land, vegetated at the time of summer imagery but bare soil during the winter, is  also included in this land cover type: hence any temporarily bare ground (e.g. from scrub- clearance, development, mining or soil tipping) would be classified in this category.  Fuller key-name: arable and other seasonally or temporarily bare ground.  This category carries the label '18' in the 25 'target' class dataset. 13 O - SUBURBAN / RURAL DEVELOPMENT  The suburban/rural development category includes all land where the pixels of the Landsat  image have recorded a mixture of built-up land and permanent vegetation. Most suburban  and rural developments, where the buildings and associated car-parks etc. remain small  enough that they do not fill all of each pixel, are included in this cover-type. Small rural  industrial estates, glasshouses, railway stations, larger rural roads, villages, small retail  sites are all included in this class.  Fuller key-name: suburban and rural developed land comprising buildings and/or roads but  with some cover of permanent vegetation.  This category carries the label '20' in the 25 'target' class dataset.      P - URBAN DEVELOPMENT  The urban development category covers all developments which are large enough to  completely fill individual pixels, to the exclusion of significant quantities of permanent  vegetation. It includes cities, large town centres, major industrial and commercial sites,  major areas of concrete and tarmac, plus permanent bare ground associated with these  developments, such as car-parks and tips.  Fuller key-name: industrial, urban and any other developments, lacking permanent  vegetation.  This category carries the label '21' in the 25 'target' class dataset.      Q - INLAND BARE GROUND  The inland bare ground category includes all 'natural' surfaces such as rock, sand, gravel  or soil, though their origin has often not been natural: the exceptions are coastal features  which classify as beach/mudflat/cliffs. Ground which has been bared by human activities,  or by livestock would be included. Imported surfaces of sand or gravel (eg car parks)  would also be classed as bare ground.  Fuller key-name: ground bare of vegetation, surfaced with 'natural' materials.  This category carries the label '22' in the 25 'target' class dataset.      UNCLASSIFIED  Within the 25m data about 2% of Great Britain remains unclassified, i.e. unallocated to  any of the 25 'target' cover-types described above. These occurrences represent (i) some  small areas within scenes that were either obscured by cloud upon both the summer and  winter imagery used for the classification, (ii) some locations for which a single scene of  cloud free imagery was not available to the mapping project (e.g. the island of Tiree), and  (c) some areas of unusual cover types that were not defined by the classifier training  exercise.  In the 25m grid cell data these cells are uniquely labelled, with the value '0', in the same  manner as those cells designated to one of the 25 target cover-types. In the 1km  summary data the proportion of each 1km cell that is unclassified is represented by  default, by the difference between the sum of the values for the 17 key cover-types and  100.  Fuller key-name: cover-types which did not fit into the 25 'target' classes.  This category carries the label '0' in the 25 'target' class dataset.      Land Cover Map 2000 is now available. Further information on its creation and potential is  available within the Countryside 2000 website, some sample data (1km resolution) can be  seen here, and is available for download at the Countryside Information System data  download site.

Environmental context and metadata for permafrost soil samples, NWT & YT, Canada, 2020 Steve Kokelj’s sampling notes for profiles HUS and CRB_S      Analytical methods  All collected soil samples where frozen upon return to field station and shipped frozen to the University of Exeter where they remained in frozen storage until processing. Soil samples were defrosted and manually homogenised by mixing, a small (~10g) subsamples was then oven dried to a constant weight, ground and weighed out for CN analysis in June 2021 by Nina L. Friggens. 15 mg (+/- 0.5mg) of each homogenised and ground soil sample was weighed out and run through the elemental analyser.  Laboratory instrumentation The instrument used to analyse the soils for C and N content was a Thermo Scientific Flash 2000 Elemental Analyser for organic elemental analysis.  Quality control Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was used as standards at the start of the CN run and as ‘check standards’ every ten samples. The EDTA standard is 9.59% N (+/- 3% accepted) and 41.1% C (+/- 1% accepted). Nature and Units of recorded values

Introduction    1.1 About the COSMOS-UK project    COSMOS-UK was established in 2013 and is therefore a recent initiative which is still  developing in terms of the number of sites deployed and services offered to  users. Our ambition is to expand our network and to enhance the information  services provided. Visit the web site to learn about changes and improvements  (cosmos.ceh.ac.uk).    The primary purpose of the COSMOS-UK project is to deliver soil moisture data in  near real-time from a network of sites installed across the UK. The innovation  provided by COSMOS-UK comes from the use of a sensor that exploits cosmic-rays  to measure soil moisture over an area of up to 12 hectares (about 30 acres). The  sensor sits above ground and operates automatically to deliver data from remote  sites. This contrasts with other sensors that are intrusive, effectively point-scale, and  require an on-site operator.    It is anticipated that publically accessible near real-time information will empower all  kinds of applied environmental research: more accurate meteorological models;  better water resource information of current and future conditions; increased  resilience to natural hazards, for example by earlier flood warnings; improved water  use efficiency in crop production and give better crop yield forecasts. It will enable a  step change in fundamental science, particularly, meteorological predictability  associated with soil moisture, and better models of greenhouse gas emissions from  soils. COSMOS-UK will open up other environmental science areas where UK soil  moisture data has not been available before, such as applications in ecosystem  services.    The use of new technology is exciting and potentially rewarding but not without its  challenges. There is research to do in interpreting the measurements obtained from  the COSMOS-UK sites, e.g. adjusting raw measurements to give a reliable value of  soil moisture, and relating to measurements derived from other techniques.     1.2 About this guide    This guide is intended for users and potential users of the COSMOS-UK data, both  within CEH and externally.    The following sections give information on the COSMOS-UK sites, instrumentation,  available data and information products including standard retrievals.    Section 7 contains a fairly detailed description of the cosmic ray soil moisture  method. COSMOS-UK User guide  2    2.

Some clustering of sites enables us to explore  variability between sites at local, regional and national levels.  Listed below are factors used in the evaluation of potential sites, and whether they  have a positive or negative influence. Some factors are both positive and negative  influences on site selection; for example we are keen to sample locations not already  represented in the network (a positive influence), but also to avoid undue duplication  of site characteristics that are already well represented in the network (a negative  influence).  Factors considered:    Geographic location - providing desired spatial coverage within network.  [Positive & negative]    Environmental variables (e.g. climate, soil, geology, land cover and  topography). [Positive & negative]    High soil moisture variability. [Positive]    Existing, relevant, on-going research and monitoring activities at the site.  [Strong positive]    Opportunities for COSMOS-UK data to directly satisfy research goals and  foster collaboration, such as data assimilation into models, validation of  remote sensing, and support of other monitoring programmes. [Positive]    Proximity to open water or shallow/perched groundwater [Strong negative]    Long-term permission for instrument installation and soil sampling. [Strong  positive]    Ease of access. [Strong positive]    Risk of vandalism. [Strong negative]    Mobile phone network coverage. [Positive] COSMOS-UK User guide  5    3. Instrumentation   Instruments used by the COSMOS-UK network are listed in Table 3.1. Note that  instrumentation has changed with time and that not all instruments are installed at all  sites (see Table 3.2).    This information is provided for reference only and implies no endorsement of the  specific instrument or supplier by CEH.      Table 3.1 Instrument used by COSMOS-UK.  Cosmic-Ray Neutron Sensor (CRNS)    The sensor counts fast neutrons which can be  converted to soil moisture after field calibration. Data  processing accounts for variations in atmospheric  pressure, humidity, and the intensity of incoming  cosmic rays. The method is described in Section 7.    The measurement volume of the sensor is many  tens of meters horizontally (possibly up to 200m)  although measurement is inversely related to  distance from the sensor. The effective depth varies  with soil moisture but is typically in the range 15- 40cm. Köhli et al (2015) provide a recent discussion  of the sensor footprint.    Model: Hydroinnova CRS-2000 and CRS-1000/B    Rain gauge     Provides data on the amount and intensity of solid  and liquid precipitation. On-board processing  algorithms account for spurious changes due to  temperature or wind speed.    Model: OTT Pluvio² COSMOS-UK User guide  6    Point soil moisture sensor     Soil moisture sensors at various depths use the  TDT (time domain transmissometry) technique and  provide absolute volumetric water content and soil  temperature.    Note that the soil moisture data are not calibrated to  the site specific soil type, but rely on generic  calibration information.    The sampling volume is a region around the  waveguide which has a total length of 30cm.  Blonquist et al (2005) suggest that the sampling  volume is no greater than 15 cm (half length of wave  guide) x 6 cm(horizontal) x3 cm(vertical)    All COSMOS-UK sites have a minimum of 2 TDT  point soil sensors, those marked as having a ‘TDT  array’ in Table 3 have 10.    Model: Acclima Digital TDT Soil Moisture Sensor    Profile soil moisture sensor    A profile probe with three sensors provides soil  moisture at depths of 0.15, 0.40 and 0.65 m. The  probe sits within a specially-designed access tube  and is sensitive over a radius of around 0.10 m,  although the region of highest sensor sensitivity is  closest to the access tube. Sensors use the TDT  (time domain transmissometry) technique.     Note that the soil moisture data are not calibrated to  the site specific soil type, but rely on generic  calibration information.    According to the manufacturer’s documentation  Each of the sensors has a measurement field of  11cm vertically and the effective penetration depth  of the probe is 10cm (note that this is not uniform  around the sensor but elliptical. Air gaps around the  installation tube can have a detrimental effect on  instrument accuracy.    Model: IMKO PICO-PROFILE Soil Moisture Sensor COSMOS-UK User guide  7    Soil heat flux plate    Two heat flux plates at each site provide the soil  heat flux at a depth of 0.03 m. These plates have a  self-calibrating feature to maximise measurement  accuracy; the in situ calibration is performed once a  day.    Model: Hukseflux HFP01SC self-calibrating heat flux  plate      Soil temperature sensor    The near-surface soil temperature is measured at  five depths (0.02, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20 and 0.50 m) using  a profile of thermocouples.    Model: Hukseflux STP01  Radiometer    A four-component radiometer measures the  individual radiation components using upward and  downward facing pyranometers (for the shortwave  components) and pyrgeometers (for the longwave  components). The net radiation is calculated as the  sum of the incoming minus the outgoing  components and is usually the dominant term in the  surface energy balance. In the photo the radiometer  is at the right-hand end of the horizontal support.    Model: Hukseflux four-component radiometer. COSMOS-UK User guide  8    Automatic weather station    Air temperature and relative humidity are measured  by a probe situated within a naturally aspirated  radiation shield; barometric pressure is also  measured.     Model: Rotronic HC2A-S3 within the Gill MetPak Pro  Base Station  Phase 3 barometric pressure sensor    A barometric pressure sensor which incorporates a  Barocap® silicon capacitive pressure sensor  encased in a plastic shell with an intake valve for  pressure equalisation. Measures barometric  pressure equivalent to an elevation range from  below sea level to 4.5km.    Model: Vaisala PTB110 Barometric Pressure  Sensor.  Phase 3 temperature and humidity sensor    Humidity and air temperature are measured by a  capacitive thin film HUMICAP© polymer sensor and  resistive platinum sensor (Pt100) respectively. Both  the humidity and temperature sensors are located at  the tip of the probe protected by a removable filter.     Model: Vaisala HUMICAP HMP155A Humidity and  Temperature Probe.    3D sonic anemometer    Monitors wind speeds of 0-50m/s (0-100mph), and  wind direction.

It can also provide  information on cloud cover, snow cover, surface  ponding and atmospheric visibility.    Model: Motobotix S14 IP camera with hemispheric  lenses  Snow depth sensor    Sonic rangefinder designed specifically to measure  snow depth.     Model: Campbell Scientific SR50A  Snow water equivalent    The sensor records the intensity of downward- directed secondary cosmic-rays that penetrate the  snow pack. This intensity is proportional to the mass  of snow traversed by cosmic-rays, and is related to  soil water equivalent (SWE) through a calibration  function.

Available data  The data available from the COSMOS-UK network are listed below in Tables 4.1 &  4.2. As noted in Section 6 these data are subject to ongoing quality control and gap  filling protocols together with changes in data processing and therefore their  availability and value may change with time.    It is anticipated that further derived data sets will be made available in the future.

COSMOS-UK User guide  13    5. Accessing COSMOS-UK data    COSMOS-UK data are available via the CEH Environmental Information Data Centre  (EIDC) at http://eidc.ceh.ac.uk/.    These data are uploaded to the EIDC in annual tranches and cover the period up to  1-2 years behind the date of the upload into the EIDC. Thus in 2018 data are  uploaded for the period up to 2016.    Requests for data not available via the EIDC will be considered but can only be met if  the request is deemed reasonable in terms of the effort require to abstract and  deliver the requested data. All data requests should be made to  cosmosuk@ceh.ac.uk    All data supplied must be considered to be provisional, in that they may be subjected  to further or revised quality control, and are supplied on the understanding that CEH  accepts no liability for their use.    Data are supplied with a licence setting out the terms under which they can be  exploited.    CEH also welcomes enquiries regarding collaborative research opportunities related  to the COSMOS-UK project.    Data can be viewed as graphs on the live data page COSMOS-UK website. At  present the web site only displays precipitation, air temperature and soil moisture  from the CRNS, or neutron counts if the site is not yet calibrated, and over a 6-month  period back from the present day. There are plans to completely redevelop this page  to allow more variables to be displayed over a user-specified period.    Several standard graphical retrievals are available, examples of which are presented  in Appendix D. COSMOS-UK User guide  14    6. Data processing  Data processing is required to ensure the quality of the COSMOS-UK data streams  and to calculate derived data.    Derived data include the volumetric water content (VWC) calculated from the cosmic  ray neutron sensor (CRNS). This is very obviously a derived product as the  measured quantity (neutron counts) needs considerable processing, and combining  with other data streams, to give a VWC. Even with this processing the underpinning  data stream is noisy so that values of VWC derived from the counts over 30 minute  intervals are not usable– some form of time-averaging is required to remove this  noise and reveal the underlying signal. Research continues on how best to process  the data from the CRNS. Section 7 provides information on the processing of neutron  counts to volumetric water content.    Without getting too philosophical about it, most measurements are indirect and must  be processed. For example, a weighing raingauge does what it says and measures  the mass of accumulated rainfall, which must be processed to give 1-minute rainfall  depths in mm. Some of this processing is done in the instrument or data logger, so  that the raw data are already in the form required.    COSMOS-UK sites also contain pairs of some instruments, i.e. heat flux plates and  point soil moisture sensors. These are currently provided as separate data sets  although users may decide to use the average value.    Data processing can also derive averages or accumulations over longer intervals  than used to capture the data. So for example hourly or daily sets can be derived.  Doing this requires some consideration about what to do with missing data. When  aggregating daily data up to 2 hours of data are allowed to be missing.    6.1 Quality Control    Quality control procedures are subject to continuous development. Raw (level1) data  are currently subject to two stages of quality control.     1. Automatically applied QC tests (see Table 6.1). Data that fail these  tests are removed from the level 2 dataset. Tests are applied to specific  variables, for details on which variables are subject to which test see  Appendix F.  2. A daily visual inspection of all data on automatically generated plots  showing 1 and 10 day time frames.      Raw data passing the level1 checks are copied into a level2 data set, i.e. the original  data remain available for further review. The labels “LEVEL1” and “LEVEL2” are  attached to variable names in some (but not all) of the references to, and labels for,  COSMOS-UK data. COSMOS-UK User guide  15    Table 6.1 Quality control tests applied to data. For details on which variables tests  are applied to see Appendix G.  TEST   DESCRIPTION  ZERO DATA  Data equal to zero where this is not a possible value.  For certain variables missing data is marked using a zero.  For  variables where this is true any zero values are removed as these  are assumed to be missing.    TOO FEW  SAMPLES  Data with too few half hourly samples.  For variables that are a sum or average of numerous continuous  readings in the preceding half hour period; if any of these readings  are missing the measurement is unreliable and data are removed.  LOW POWER  Data recorded where battery voltage is low.  Low battery power can mean measurements are missing or  unreliable. If the battery pack voltage goes below 11V the associated  data will be removed.  SENSOR FAULT  Data associated with a sensor that has a known fault  DIAGNOSTIC  FLAG  Data that has been assigned a diagnostic flag by the instrument.  OUT OF RANGE  Data that are outside an acceptable range for that variable.  Each variable measured at each site has a minimum and maximum  value set. If the measurement of this particular variable goes out of  this range it will be removed.  SECONDARY  VARIABLE  Data dependant on another variable and the other variable is  incorrect.  Some measurements are dependent on the measurements of  another variable being reasonable. For example measurements of  the components of radiation are not reliable when the body  temperature (of the radiometer) measurement is out of the  acceptable range. This test will remove values from the dependent  variables if the main variable is not correct.  SPIKE  Data that are greater than a threshold value smaller/larger than the  neighbouring values.  If a value is greater than a certain threshold away from its  neighbouring values this is removed.  ERROR CODES  Data where the logger programme has assigned an error code value  due to a sensor/programme fault.  When there is a fault with the sensor for some variables the logger  programme can record a value of 7999.      6.2 Gap filling    Gaps can occur in the data because of instrument failure, failure in data logging or  telecommunications, and failure at quality control.    Currently no gap-filling is undertaken. COSMOS-UK User guide  16    7. Processing the CRNS data  In this section is a description of cosmic rays, how they interact with the atmosphere  and soil, and how counting neutrons is the basis for deriving soil moisture. This is  followed by a discussion of the noise in the cosmic ray derived soil moisture data and  what this implies for the temporal resolution of the data.    7.1 About cosmic-rays     Primary cosmic-rays are high-energy sub-atomic particles that originate from outer  space and continuously bombard the Earth. The intensity of cosmic-rays arriving at  the top of the Earth’s atmosphere varies with the events that generate them (distant  astronomical events) and factors such as variations in the solar magnetosphere. The  particles are mostly (90%) protons with a typical energy of around 1 GeV.     When these particles enter the Earth’s atmosphere they collide with atoms in the air  and create a shower of secondary cosmic-ray particles (including neutrons), which  may or may not interact with other particles before reaching the Earth’s surface. Each  collision causes the particle (neutron) to lose energy. The energy spectrum of these  neutrons at the Earth’s surface contains a number of peaks. At around 100 MeV are  high energy neutrons, which interact with air and soil to produce a second peak, at  around 1 MeV, of fast neutrons, also known as evaporated neutrons (that is not  evaporation as understood by hydrologists but the “release” of neutrons following the  collision of a high energy particle, e.g. a proton or neutron, with the nucleus of an  atom).    Further collisions cause a further reduction in the energy of the neutrons until they  become ‘thermalised’ i.e. in thermal equilibrium with the environment; that is they can  neither lose more energy nor regain lost energy. These thermalized, or thermal,  neutrons, have typical energies of around 0.1 eV. Neutrons with energies greater  than thermal neutrons may be referred to as epi-thermal, generally meaning greater  than 0.5 eV; fast neutrons are therefore within the epi-thermal range. Kohli et al.  (2015) provide an illustration of this energy spectrum, reproduced below as Figure  7.1.    The themalisation of neutrons (also known as moderation) is highly dependent on the  properties of the particles (elements) the cosmic rays hit. Hydrogen is the most  efficient element in terms of its stopping power of fast neutrons; 18 collisions with  hydrogen will thermalize a fast neutron whereas this takes 149 collisions with  oxygen. This is explained by the fact that the light hydrogen nucleus, comprising just  one proton, can absorb a lot of the energy from the neutron in a collision (much like  when two billiard balls collide) whereas when a neutron hits a large nucleus it  bounces off retaining most of its energy (like a billiard ball hitting the cushion on the  snooker table, this nice analogy is from Zreda et al., 2012). This stopping power  combined with the abundance of hydrogen in air and soil means that the process of  thermalisation is largely determined by the presence of hydrogen. COSMOS-UK User guide  17      Figure 7.1 Neutron energy spectra reproduced from Kohli et al (2015)      These collisions result in neutrons being scattered in all directions, i.e. between and  within the air and soil, and the process of thermalisation is effectively instantaneous  because of the high energy/velocity of the fast neutrons. The concentration of fast  neutrons therefore very quickly reaches an equilibrium in both the soil and the air,  and a key factor in determining the concentration is the amount of hydrogen that is  present.    This is the basis of the cosmic-ray soil moisture method. A sensor at the land surface  will count more fast neutrons when there is little hydrogen (water) present and fewer  fast neutrons when there is more hydrogen to remove energy from the neutrons  leading to their themalisation.    7.2 Converting counts to soil moisture    The neutron counter is basically a tube containing a gas that can convert thermal  neutrons into detectable electrons by ionisation; higher energy neutrons pass through  the tube without interacting with the gas. In its “bare” format the sensor therefore  counts themalised rather than fast neutrons, although there is not a sharp cut-off in  its detection limit.    A “moderated” tube contains the same sensor embedded in a material that causes  the themalisation of neutrons and therefore counts neutrons in a higher energy  range, although some lower energy neutrons are also likely to be counted.  Andreasen et al., 2015 presents figures showing part of the neutron energy spectrum  sampled by bare and moderated detectors, reproduced below as Figure 7.2. COSMOS-UK User guide  18      Figure 7.2 Sampling of neutron energy spectra by bare and moderated detectors,  from Andreasen et al. (2016). The dashed line represents 0.5eV.    Zreda et al (2012) suggest that the moderated tube is used to measure soil moisture  and that the bare tube is potentially useful for water that is present above the land  surface in snow, vegetation etc. COSMOS-UK prototype sites were equipped with  both types of tubes; sites installed subsequently only have moderated tubes.  From the above there is an understanding, in principle at least, of how the intensity of  cosmic ray derived neutrons measured at the Earth’s surface is influenced by water  contained within in soil. The processing of neutron counts to derive volumetric water  content has been described in, for example, Evans et al. (2016) and what follows is a  brief overview.    Firstly, correction factors are applied to the recorded neutron counts to account for  variations in background cosmic ray intensity (as measured by a high altitude  reference site at Junfraujoch, Switzerland), altitude, atmospheric pressure and  atmospheric water vapour. This adjusted number of counts is known as the  ‘corrected counts’.     There are currently three methods that can be used to derive water content from the  corrected counts: (1) Site specific N0 method, (2) universal calibration method (also  known as hydrogen molar fraction, hmf, method), and (3) neutron transport modelling  (e.g. MCNP, COSMIC, URANOS). These methods are described in Baatz et al.  (2014) and Bogena et al. (2015). The first of these methods is the most  straightforward to apply and as a consequence the most widely used. Baatz et al.  (2014) conclude that all three methods estimate soil water content with acceptable  errors when compared to estimates determined using soil sampling and laboratory  analysis.    COSMOS-UK uses the first of these methods in which a reference soil water content  is obtained from field calibration, see Franz (2012) and Zreda et al. (2012). This  reference value is then used in combination with an equation relating corrected  counts to soil water content (with parameters applicable for a generic silica soil  matrix; see Desilets et al. (2010)), to calculate a site specific N0 calibration  coefficient. The COSMOS-UK procedure also follows the procedures in Zreda et al.  (2012) and Franz et al. (2013) to account for the effects of lattice and bound water  (structural water associated with clay minerals in the soil) and soil organic carbon (a  minor constituent of mineral soils, but the major constituent of peat soils). COSMOS-UK User guide  19    7.3 Averaging to reduce noise in soil moisture    As noted in Evans et al. (2016), although the counts are recorded by COSMOS-UK  on an hourly basis “the noise associated with the cosmic-ray technique … (in) UK  conditions” means that averaging at 6 hours or 24 hours is recommended. The UK  conditions referred to here are the general wetness of the UK soils, low altitude and  high soil organic carbon at particular sites, which reduce the number of neutron  counts; from the background above it will be noted that this is the basis of the  measurement technique but the wetness of the UK soils was outside the range  observed in the USA where the method originated. In practice processing on an  hourly basis using standard equations as referenced above can lead to values of soil  moisture of greater than 100% or less than 0%, hence the necessity to censor or  average values at some stage in the processing. In fact some 1.2% of all hourly VWC  values were greater than 100%, whereas less than 0.01% of values were less than  0%. Note that hourly VWC data could also be unavailable because of missing data,  i.e. the numbers of counts or those variables needed to derive the corrected counts.     COSMOS-UK has employed several variations in methods of data processing and by  late 2016 had generally adopted a method that censored (filtered) hourly values with  >100% or <0% water content and then averaged as appropriate, e.g. to give a daily  mean. An arbitrary decision had to be made about how many hourly values could be  missing for a daily mean to be considered acceptable (generally one missing value  was allowed). The COSMOS-UK recommendation was that generally the hourly data  were too noisy to be useful and that the daily mean data should be used. Because of  the filtering, the daily VWC could not be outside the range 0-100%, but could  approach these limits and therefore not be considered sensible measurements of soil  moisture. Data supplied to users alerted then to these issues and advised caution in  their use.    Across all sites the changes to the averaging and VWC calculation methods have  improved the number of daily VWC values calculated from 84% to 92%. However,  the degree of improvement varies between sites with the biggest improvement being  at the sites with high soil organic carbon content such as Redmere where the  changes have led to a 60% improvement on the number of daily days of data  generated.    Note that the problems associated with high VWC generally relate to sites with peat  soils in which higher VWC values are expected. VWC data from mineral soils with  lower water content are more reliable; problems are rare in the daily data from  mineral soils, although the hourly data are still noisy.    7.4 The CRNS footprint    The characteristics of the sensor footprint were understood to vary relatively little with  distance from the sensor as soil wetness changes, but the sensor penetration depth  below the ground surface decreases markedly with soil water content. This variation  has been characterised by the soil depth from which 86%5 of the measured neutron  counts have originated (effective depth). Franz et al. (2013) provide a way of                                               5 86% represents two e-fold drops or 1-1/e2 (Zreda et al., 2008) COSMOS-UK User guide  20    calculating an average effective depth which was initially used by COSMOS-UK. In  the wettest conditions this depth can be as little as 0.08m, very much less than the  0.76m given by Zreda et al. (2008) for dry soils in the USA. At this time the sensor  footprint was considered to be roughly 300m in radius (i.e. 86% of measured  neutrons were generated from within this footprint).    These footprint characteristics informed the field soil sampling protocol used to obtain  the reference soil water content mentioned above.    Kohli et al. (2015) published a re-evaluation of the sensor footprint and changes to  way in which calibration data are used to calculate the reference soil water content. A  key finding was that 50% of the neutrons counted came from within 50m of the  sensor, and that the sensor showed “extraordinary sensitivity” to the closest few  meters to the sensor.    While this result led to a change in the field sampling protocol used by COSMOS-UK  (i.e. the protocol was changed to take samples closer to the sensor), this in itself has  little impact as the COSMOS-UK sites have been selected to have similar  characteristics over the larger footprint. There is no reason to suspect that soil  moisture varies significantly with distance from the sensor.    Kohli et al. (2015) also suggested other changes which relate to the way averaging of  soil moisture and bulk density is performed both for calibration of the sensor and the  derivation of water content. Of these changes the biggest impact comes from using  the bulk density averaged across all samples rather than using just those samples  corresponding to the effective depth at the time of the field sampling. This has a  particular impact in peat soils in which bulk density increases considerably with  depth.    7.5 Revised method for daily averaging    Introducing the above changes to the method of deriving VWC further reduced the  number of hourly VWC values that were below zero, or greater than 100%, by about  30%. It has been decided to set negative values to zero but to leave values greater  than 100% in the data set, so that the user should determine how to handle data  considered unreliable.    However, whilst making these changes it was decided to change the way in which  daily averages were derived. The “old” method was to filter counts to avoid out of  range values of VWC and then average to daily. The new method is to derive an  average number of hourly counts for the day and use this to derive the daily VWC;  this method resulted in only a tiny percentage of values greater than 100% and no  negative values. These >100% values are left in the data set with the user advised to  check all high VWC values. Again it was decided that the daily mean number of  counts could be used even with some hourly counts missing. After inspecting the  data for missing values, which could arise from any of the required variables being  missing, it was decided to allow up to two missing hourly values in deriving daily  mean VWC. COSMOS-UK User guide  21    The figures below demonstrate how these changes impact on the daily data. Firstly,  at Rothamsted which is a mineral soil, the difference is just a few percent, and in this  case VWC is increased, probably just for some quirk in the way the bulk density was  calculated.         Figure 7.3 VWC as percentage at Rothamsted comparing original method (black)  and revised method (red) – the difference is tiny, just a few percent.    At sites with peat soils the difference is more noticeable. The graph below shows  data from Glensaugh were the laboratory analysis of soils gave an average organic  matter content of 40.6%. In comparision with Rothamsted the soils are wet as can be  seen form the scaling of the two graphs. Note also how during 2015 the soil moisture  showed no seasonal variation. The original method generated values of VWC greater  than 100% even when averaged over a day. Filtering was introduced in the original  processing to remove these unrealistically high values but led to a data set with many  gaps. The revised method generates no daily values greater than 100% at  Glensaugh. Further research is required on how best to process the data from peat  soils but in the meantime VWC values from sites with peat soils should be used with  care.          Figure 7.4 VWC as percentage at Glensaugh comparing original method without  filtering (black), original method with filtering (blue) and revised method (red). COSMOS-UK User guide  22    7.6 Revised effective depth estimation    As mentioned above, a feature of the CRNS is that since the neutrons resulting from  cosmic rays penetrate the soil, the derived VWC represents a depth averaged value.  Franz et al. (2012) provide a method of estimating an effective depth for the sensor.  This depth is dependent on VWC and has an approximate range from 10 cm in wet  soils to 80 cm in dry soils. This effective depth was calculated for COSMOS-UK sites  and made available with the VWC.    The same study that proposed a reduction to the spatial footprint of the sensor, also  reviewed depth penetration of the sensor (Kohli et al., 2015; termed D86). They  conclude that the source of neutrons sampled by the sensor is dependent on both  water content and distance from the sensor, and provide a means to estimate the  decreasing penetration depth with distance from the sensor.    COSMOS-UK now uses this method to provide D86 values at six selected distances  from the CRNS instead of the previously calculated single distance-invariant effective  depth. The distances selected correspond with the four calibration soil sampling  distances (1, 5, 25 and 75 m) along with the anticipated minimum (150 m) and  maximum (200 m) footprint radii calculated for typical wet and dry UK conditions. A  comparison of the previously derived effective depth and the D86 values is presented  below for the COSMOS-UK site at Rothamsted.      Figure 7.5 Variation in effective depth at Rothamsted: black is effective depth others  are D86 from bottom to top at 1m (brown), 5m (cyan), 25m (pink), 75m (blue), 150m  (green) and 200m (red) from the sensor.    From the figure it is obvious that the D86 values are all greater than the effective  depth. This is a consequence of the revised derived VWC, the form of the new D86  equation and the way in which soil properties are averaged in the revised method.  COSMOS-UK has made the somewhat arbitrary decision to use the 75m D86 (pink in  the above figure) as a single indicator to illustrate the variation of the sensor footprint  penetration depth with soil wetness. COSMOS-UK User guide  23    7.6 A new correction factor    As noted in Section 7.2, a correction factor is applied to the counts recorded by the  CRNS to adjust for fluctuations in incoming cosmic rays. This factor is of the form    𝐹𝑖= 𝛾(𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑓 𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑓′ −1) + 1    in which ɣ is a scaling factor to adjust for geomagnetic effects and differences  between the CRNS and the reference counter. Until 2018 the scaling factor was  always set to unity and the correction factor reduces to    Fi = Iref / Iref’     In 2018, following an investigation into spurious trends in the derived VWC data an  empirical method of deriving site-specific ɣ values was introduced to remove these  trends. This working model to correct for difference between COSMOS-UK sites and  sensors, and the characteristics of the Jungfrau reference sensor is the subject of a  paper currently in preparation.    7.7 Introduction of revised processing    It will be appreciated that various alternative methods can be adopted to derive the  VWC from the counts recorded in the cosmic ray neutron sensor. It is possible that  there will be further changes to the processing of these data.    Whenever changes are made to the processing method they are introduced to the  entire data set, i.e. at all sites back to the start of operation, to ensure consistency in  each data series. In some instances calculations using legacy methods continue in  the background.      7.8 A comparison with data from TDT sensors    The signal from the CRNS is noisy which is caused by the variability in the number of  neutrons counted by the sensor tube in the monitoring interval; there’s a lot of  randomness in the process generating these neutrons. A bigger tube, or using  several tubes at the same site would reduce the noise but, obviously, be more  expensive.    The CRNS data (counts) are logged at 30 minute intervals but most of the processing  starts with hourly accumulations. Without going into the details of the processing  hourly VWC data are routinely derived, as a starting point for further processing.  Below is a plot of some data from the COSMOS-UK site at Rothamsted for  September and October 2016 (Figure 7.6). The black crosses are the one hourly  VWC from the CRNS; the noise is obvious. Simple ways of trying to identify the  signal from the noise are to average the data either using a running mean or over a  fixed period. For this period the running mean data clearly still contain some noise;  the daily data look noise-free but for other times at other sites this is not the case. COSMOS-UK User guide  24        Figure 7.6  A comparison of VWC data from the CRNS: hourly (black), 7-hour  moving average (red) and daily (green).  At COSMOS-UK sites we have other instruments also measuring VWC. These  sample small volumes of soil but are far less noisy. The data from the two TDT  probes are generally reliable; these probes are at about 10cm depth and are  approximately 2m apart. The 30 minute data from the two TDTs are shown with the  hourly data from the CRNS in Figure 7.7 for the same site and period as in Figure  7.6.  Firstly, it’s clear that the data from the TDT probes are far less noisy that those from  the CRNS, although some averaging is probably still justified. Secondly the two TDTs  are in good general agreement as over this period they agree to with a few percent of  VWC. It is not certain that these differences are genuine differences in soil moisture  around the sensor and not the result of differences between the sensors. It is  however reasonable to assume that the differences are caused by differences in  actual VWC around the sensor. If they are genuine then it is the case that the  differences vary through time, i.e. generally the red line is above the green line, but  this is not the case for the second half of September. And at the beginning of October  there is a small increase in VWC in the red data, but not the green data; there is  perhaps a similar event around September 10 which causes the red and green lines  to diverge slightly. COSMOS-UK User guide  25      Figure 7.7  A comparison of hourly data from the CRNS (black), with 30 minute  data from two TDT sensors (red and green).  A third point to be noted from Figure 2 is that the CRNS and TDT data are in broad  agreement, but sometimes the TDTs are at the low end of the variability of the CRNS  data (1-15 September), in the centre of the CRNS data (20-30 September), and  sometimes at the top end of the CRNS data (8-15 October). One explanation of this  is that the CRNS data are not from small volumes of soil around the sensor but  sample a much larger volume of soil around the sensor.    It is partly because of the high spatial variability of soil moisture that the CRNS is  appealing as a measurement technique (there are other reasons too). The CRNS  has a large footprint possibly several hundred metres in diameter, and it also  samples water above, at, and below the surface down possibly to 20cm or deeper if  the soil is dry, as discussed in Sections 7.4 and 7.6.    Figure 7.8 compares the TDT data with the daily mean data from the CRNS. There  are periods of close agreement and periods of divergence. Possible explanations  include: different sampling volumes; different sampling periods, differences between  measurement techniques; noise in the data. COSMOS-UK User guide  26      Figure 7.8  A comparison daily VWC data from the CRNS (blue) with 30 minute  data from the two TDTs (red and green).  Thus far analysis of the COSMOS-UK have been largely subjective in nature, as in  this note. Comprehensive objective analysis will follow based on all COSMOS-UK  sites, longer periods of record, data from a “test and validation” site, and published  developments from other users of CRNS technology.    It is anticipated that a key output from these analyses will be information and  guidance about the spatial and temporal resolution of VWC data from the CRNS,  including corrections for water measured by the sensor but which is not in the soil  (e.g. surface ponding and in vegetation). At this stage it seems this may vary  between sites, soil type and land use. COSMOS-UK User guide  27      8.

COSMOS-UK User guide  36    Appendix C Phenocam images    The two wide-angle lens cameras are intended to capture qualitative information  about the environment around the COSMOS-UK site. Of particular interest are  seasonal changes in vegetation since these will have an influence on soil moisture  (i.e. the state and changes in vegetation influence water uptake by the vegetation  and depletion of soil moisture via evapo-transpiration) and the counts recorded by  cosmic-ray sensor (i.e. the sensor detects hydrogen ions in the vegetation as well as  in the soil). The study of these seasonal changes is called phenology – hence the  shorthand name for the cameras.    The phenocams are programmed to record five images per day and are captured as  image pairs as in the example below (Figure C.1). The cameras are directed due  south (left hand image) and due north.    Note that not all images are successfully captured and stored, so images may be  missing or incomplete. Images may also be of poor quality, for example because of  water or dirt on the camera lens.     The resolution of the image is either 1600x600 pixels or 2560x960 pixels. The higher  resolution images are achieved following an switch in modem introduced at new sites  from 2017, and subsequently being rolled out to all sites.          Figure C.1  Example pair of phenocam images.    In the top right hand corner of the image is a date and time stamp, so this image was  apparently taken at 14:20:03 on 31-05-2015: nothing in the image indicates the site  from which it comes.    The image is transferred from the camera to the data logger which creates an image  file timestamped with the current data logger date and time (at the moment that the  image is received by the data logger, some minutes after the image was taken by the  camera). COSMOS-UK User guide  37    In this case, the telemetered filename would have been:  BALRD_1517.jpg    [with a timestamp of 31-05-2015 13:42 GMT]    This timestamp information (unchanged, and in GMT/UTC) is written into the  filename of the image by a computer script which renames the file only after it is  received by the telemetry server at CEH. The final file name that includes the site  name and the date and time, has the format:    SITE_YYYYMMDD_HHMM_IDnnnn.jpg  Where,  SITE: COSMOS-UK Station Site Code (five upper case letters)  YYYY: 4 digit year  HH: hour (GMT/UTC)  MM: minutes  ID: ‘ID’ two fixed characters  nnnn = integer image number – this is NOT a fixed length string, and could range  from n to nnnnnn. Note this is of little value to the user.    In the above example, the final filename is:  BALRD_20150531_1342_ID1517.jpg    The difference between the two date/time stamps is caused by (a) clock drift in the  camera and (b) the transfer delay between camera and logger. The camera is  intended for use in an environment in which it can regularly connect to the internet  and synchronise with a time server, but within the COSMOS-UK instrument setup  this cannot be achieved on most current systems; however, work is underway to  provide a camera time server connection on selected upgraded sites. The data  logger however is synchronised to internet time on a daily basis and is therefore  reliable.    The important point here is to use the file name as being the approximate time at  which the phenocam images were taken and not the time in the images themselves.    As well as recording changes in vegetation, the phenocam images can provide  qualitative information about lying snow (Figure C.2) and standing water (Figures C.3  and C.4). The phenocam images can therefore be used as a means of screening to  detect periods with unusual ground conditions, or as a way of investigating unusual  data recorded by other COSMOS-UK instrumentation. COSMOS-UK User guide  38        Figure C.2  Snow as recorded by the phenocam at Plynlimon. Note also the  burning on the south facing image on the left caused by the camera pointing directly  at the sun on a clear day.

Here’s another example showing 30 days of short  wave radiation, which corresponds with sunshine, i.e. it’s easy to distinguish day from  night and cloudy conditions from clear skies.    http://nrfaapps.ceh.ac.uk/nrfa/image/cosmos/graph.png?db- level=2&site=BICKL&parameter=SWIN_LEVEL2&days=30&w=800&h=300        If the detail within the data is finer than the resolution of the final image then data can  be lost in the production of the png, and what’s more this can happen in a random COSMOS-UK User guide  44    way.

Most of the COSMOS-UK data are recorded every 30 minutes: rainfall is recorded  every minute but the above url access 30 minute data. These data are logged on  site.    The data are transferred back to CEH at Wallingford using the mobile phone network.  Every hour the site switches on its modem ready to receive a request for the data.  Wallingford then tries to connect to the site: if this is successful the data are  transferred, if not there will be repeated attempts to connect for 30 mins. If these fail  then the data remain on the logger at the site and there will be a fresh attempt to  access them during the following hour.    The data that are received at Wallingford are transferred from their raw format into a  database, and then subject to quality control that creates a cleaned version of the  data in which dubious data have been removed (this is termed LEVEL2 data). Both of  these steps run automatically.    The graphing application provided by the url described above accesses the data from  the data base when it is run, so there will always be a delay between data being  recorded at a site and it being displayed in the graph. The length of the delay will  depend on whether the automatic processes completed properly or not. The best  case is for a time lag of under two hours, but it could be considerably longer.    Once the graph has been displayed on a web page it will not update itself but it can  be refreshed manually (press F5). However, frequent refreshing could cause  problems with the underpinning services as each refresh request generates a  request through to the live COSMOS-UK data base.      Why are there sometimes gaps in the data?    Gaps can occur for a number of reasons, for example sensor faults, data logging  issues, telecommunication problems, or a failure to pass quality control.    Some gaps may be infilled later, for example data may be retrieved by visiting the  site if the gap has been caused by a communication problem.    But gaps can also be introduced later.

Surveyors are asked to record information on habitats and landscape features for a 1km square on a  series of maps held on a GIS system. Editing tasks will be carried out using a comprehensive range of  pre-determined options which relate directly to a key to vegetation types, Broad and Priority Habitats,  landscape features and previous data collected on that 1km square for Countryside Survey.     CS2007 builds on previous methodologies as well as introducing some refinements. In order to report  land cover change by Broad (as in CS2000) and Priority Habitats (not done previously) at a country as  well as a UK level the survey will:  1. Focus on mapping change in both habitats and landscape features  2. Map Priority Habitats (PH’s) as well as Broad Habitats (BH’s)  3. Collect more detailed information (than in CS2000) in unenclosed, largely upland, habitats  4. Map new squares in Wales    For the first time ever, Countryside Survey 2007 data is going to be collected in digital format. In the  preparation of the GIS data model to be used in this survey the 5 previous themes (forestry,  agriculture/natural vegetation, boundaries, structures and physiography) have been amalgamated so  that surveyors will be editing a digital map representing all features in the square.    Mapping change only      As in CS2000, for previously surveyed squares surveyors are to be provided with data from earlier  surveys and instructed to map change in land cover and landscape features.  Surveyors will be asked  to indicate genuine change and changes that highlight where, in their opinion, earlier mapping (or  subsequent data processing) resulted in the mis-allocation of polygons (mapped areas), linear features  or point features to the wrong BH. This is a key role for surveyors in this survey as they will be both  mapping change as well as correcting the data.    Reporting by ‘Broad’ and ‘Priority’ Habitats    To meet some of the monitoring and reporting requirements of the UK Biodiversity Action Plans,  once again the results from CS2007 will be presented according to an agreed framework based on  ‘Broad Habitats’. This time mapping will also be by ‘Priority Habitats’ (PH). As some of these are too  rare or scattered to be detected by a sample survey of this type, previous data has been used to obtain  statistical estimates and carry out a power analysis to see which PHs can be effectively reported.    1.  BACKGROUND CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    6  Changes to mapping Broad Habitats in upland, unenclosed landscapes    Follow-up studies to CS1990 showed that there were real difficulties in defining the extent and  location of upland polygons whose boundaries are more likely to be fuzzy and convoluted because  they are defined by changes in species composition rather than a linear boundary feature such as a  fence, hedge or wall. In CS2000 BHs were classified into Unenclosed or enclosed habitats thus:    Unenclosed Habitats: Calcareous grassland, Acid grassland, Bracken, Dwarf shrub heath, Bog, Fen,  Marsh and Swamp, Inland rock, Montane.    Enclosed habitats: Broadleaved and mixed yew woodland, Coniferous woodland, Boundary and linear  features, Arable and horticulture, Improved grass, Neutral Grass, Rivers and streams, Standing open  waters and canals, Urban, Supra-littoral sediment, Supra-littoral rock, Littoral sediment, Littoral rock.    In CS2000 a new way of mapping unenclosed BHs was introduced because of the difficulties in  spatial definition encountered in previous surveys. A much simpler mapping system was introduced  where polygons were larger and the only information recorded was the BH. It has been found  subsequently  (particularly because of the desire to report on PHs as well as BHs and the requirement  to provide consistent information on common standards monitoring attributes) that insufficient detail  was recorded using this method, so in CS2007 all habitats will be described in more detail.     As there is no detailed attribute information available from 1998 in unenclosed habitats, where  available, data from CS1990 has been combined with data from CS2000 to provide more detail on  habitats and species present. This will enable surveyors to identify particular areas of PH and provide  support for decisions about the correctness of the CS2000 BH allocation and the allocation to be  applied in 2007. For example, where a site was allocated to the Bog BH in 1998 but contained species  typical of the Blanket Bog PH in 1990 and still does in 2007, the surveyor will be able to indicate that  the site has been continuously Blanket Bog PH. In this instance the surveyor would therefore leave the  polygon assignment to the Blanket Bog PH unchanged.       Surveyors will be asked to record/change/validate vegetation attributes for each polygon in 2007,  including habitat and species information (where present). Mapping carried out in CS2007 will be less  detailed than in 1990 in the unenclosed uplands but more detailed than in CS2000. For some PH, this  will be the first survey in which they will be mapped hence new baseline information will be  recorded. CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    7  Mapping new squares in Wales    An extra 60 new squares have been added to the survey to enable country level reporting on habitats  for Wales    Mapping methods in 2007 need to reflect the goals above but also need to take account of  the strategic need to maintain a time-series of detailed, disaggregated environmental  surveillance data that provides for a wide range of scientific applications and future shifts  in policy emphasis.                     Enclosed habitats  In enclosed, largely lowland, habitats, surveyors will edit polygons mapped and defined in the 1998  survey. Surveyors will be able to select the appropriate BH, validate, change and newly apply primary  and secondary attributes. They will also be able to select, where relevant, from a subset of PHs. Since  Priority Habitats nest into BHs, a polygon can be newly attributed as PH even though it’s BH and  habitat attributes remain the same as previously. This is because many PHs are being recorded for the  first time in this survey and so constitute new baseline information.     Unenclosed habitats  Presentation of spatial data for editing in unenclosed habitats is complicated. Firstly, follow-up  analyses of change after CS2000 showed that some assignments of polygons to BH in 1998 may need  correcting as a result of ambiguity in the vegetation key or post survey data processing, i.e. surveyors  will need to back-correct the 1998 map in some places. As outlined above, more finely resolved  CS1990 data will be amalgamated with the coarser mapping units resolved in CS2000. This will  provide more detail on vegetation type and species presence both to identify particular areas of PH  and to support decisions about the correctness of the CS2000 BH allocations. Surveyors will be asked  to record/change/validate vegetation attributes for each polygon in 2007, including habitat and species  information (where present). The incorporation of 1990 data means that polygons of the same BH in  the CS2007 dataset may be differentiated on the basis of vegetation type/species level differences. In  the CS2007 survey surveyors will be asked to merge adjacent polygons of the same vegetation type  (see key) and record dominant species i.e. polygons will be based on areas of uniform vegetation type,  though there may be patches with different species compositions within the polygon.         2. STRUCTURE OF THE 2007 EDITABLE POLYGON/HABITATS LAYER CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    8  The role of the field keys to habitats and woodland types/features    Two keys are provided in the handbook. Each solves the problem of assigning surveyed areas and  features to the units of a classification.     Key to Broad and Priority Habitats (Vegetation Key)    Based on plant species composition, patches of discrete vegetation (polygons) are assigned primary  (and selected secondary attributes) and allocated by the surveyor to Broad and Priority Habitats. The  key allows all vegetation stands to be keyed to a BH and to all PH’s apart from those known as habitat  complexes (i.e.those for which final definition requires the application of an agreed GIS mask to  surveyed areas; and coastal PHs for which CS is unrepresentative because the limit of survey is Mean  High Water Spring tide).     Application of the key to an area of uniform habitat (or mapped polygon) gives the evidence upon  which to base any decision about retaining or changing the habitats and attributes of that polygon.    Key to woodland types/features       Vegetation featuring woodland and scrub comprises a range of types from; scattered trees, hedges,  lines of trees or patches of scrub through to large blocks of woodland.  These different structures can  be classified according to strict definitions relating to attributes such as width, number of trees and  canopy cover. This key allows the surveyor to allocate woody vegetation to the correct feature. So  why do this? At present, only certain woody features (Woodland/forest, Belt of trees and Clump of  trees) can be assigned to the Broadleaved Woodland BH and constituent PHs. Thus a line of Alder  does not qualify as Wet Woodland PH and neither does a line of Ash or Oak trees. Both would be  assigned to the Boundaries & Linear Features BH. Similarly, scattered trees indicates a minor role for  the woody vegetation such that the BH, primary and secondary attributes are assigned to the  herbaceous vegetation and scattered trees indicated as an additional secondary attribute only. This key  also allows features such as lines of trees or hedges to be allocated to Woody Linear Features (WLFs).  A detailed section on the mapping of WLFs is included in the Linears section.     How will the two keys be used?    The first key that surveyors use when faced with a woody feature or area will be the Key to woodland  types/features. With experience the decision to record a woodland feature in a particular way will be  made rapidly and surveyors will often only quickly refer to part of a key to confirm their mapping  decision. If surveying an area of woodland or scrub, the surveyor will need to first establish that tree CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    9  or shrub canopy cover is over 25%. If so, the surveyor then needs to determine whether the primary  attributes Belt of trees, Clump of trees, Woodland/forest apply and hence whether the patch could be  assigned to a woodland BH (and potentially) a woodland PH. If any of the three attributes apply then  the patch can be keyed out using the vegetation key based on its canopy species composition.          As surveyors may need to refer to previous data sets to support a decision about change and to better  understand the data on the tablet, the key below features the list of primary and secondary attributes  which were used in the surveys carried out for CS2000 by name     Vegetation may only be sparsely present, for example on rock exposures, peat hags or in urban  environments. If no vegetation is present the BH will likely be Urban, Inland Rock or one of the  coastal types. Exercise common sense. Remember that ALL land must be allocated to a BH or PH. If  no vegetation is present consult the BH and attribute descriptions and edit/add attributes accordingly.      3.  THE VEGETATION KEY CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    10  CS2007 FIELD SURVEY KEY AND ALLOCATION RULES TO BROAD AND NON-COASTAL PRIORITY HABITATS    Authors: SIMON SMART, BOB BUNCE, ROB LARGE, PETE CAREY, DAVE HOWARD, KEITH KIRBY, LINDSAY MASKELL (incorporating  suggestions from Stuart Smith, Jim Latham, Clare Burrows, Mark Crick, Ian Strachan, Keith Kirby, Alex Turner and Heather Robertson)        Numbered links  plus Broad and  Priority Habitats  Primary  attributes  NVC units  (indicative list  only)    1a  Total vegetation cover may be variable but where present consists of over 75% herbaceous  species.  2                1b  Vegetation cover consisting of over 25% canopy cover of trees or shrubs over 1m high.  17                1c  Vegetation with over 25% cover of dwarf shrubs, less than 1m.

See guidance notes for post-clearfell vegetation  Exit key -not  vegetation                2a  Vegetation consisting of Bracken at ≥95% cover with or without a sparse herbaceous understorey.   Stands that have not yet peaked in seasonal biomass should still be recorded as dense Bracken if  you believe peak cover is likely to be at least 95%.  Note that bracken can occur in amongst  boulders.  In these situations judgement is required as to whether the area that can support plant  growth is so dominated by bracken that the polygon should be mapped as BH 9 but Surface  boulders or Scree added as attributes. Alternatively consider a mosaic.  Dense Bracken   (BH 9)  Bracken at 95- 100% cover    U20, W25            2b  Bracken <95% cover or absent – the species code for Bracken plus cover intervals should be used  in conjunction with any other primary and secondary attributes and relevant BH e.g. Acid  grassland. Hence, the underlying species assemblage requires further keying.  3    U20, W25, other  grasslands and  heaths            2c  Vegetation consisting of crops (including grass leys in arable rotation). Note that ploughed land  should be indicated as such but a primary attribute used to reflect the previous crop where this can  be identified. If not possible, use ‘ploughed land’ as a primary attribute  (also see guidance notes  for Orchards).  Arable and  Horticultural   (BH 4)   Arable crop  types listed in  drop-down box              3a  Coastal vegetation containing halophytic species1.  4                                                            1 Coastal BH are not keyed further to Priority Habitat because CS is not a representative sample of these localised habitats.

Saltmarsh Priority  habitat (BH 21  Littoral sediment)   Saltmarsh              4b  Vegetation with halophytes prominent. On sea cliffs.  Maritime cliffs and  slopes vegetation  Priority Habitat  (BH 18 Supra- littoral rock)  Maritime cliffs  and slope  vegetation              4c  Vegetation growing on sand dunes including yellow dunes, grey dunes and slacks2.  Sand dune Priority  Habitat (BH 19  Supra-littoral  sediment)  Sand dunes              4d  Generally linear vegetation, just above the high-tide mark, consisting of halophytes such as Cakile  maritima, Agropyron junceiforme and Honkenya peploides. Sometimes with generalist ruderals  such as Stellaria media and Rumex obtusifolius.  Strandline/Coastal  vegetated shingle  Priority Habitat  (BH 19)    Strandline  vegetation                                                                    2 Machair should be coded according to the floristic composition of constituent parcels - this allows variation from place to place within a Machair landscape to be reflected        in the land cover map and acknowledges that Machair has cultural and geographical, as well as floristic, connotations. CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    13  5a  Pulse-disturbance vegetation. Includes assemblages whose species composition suggests  disturbance in the past but with no evidence of being subject to recent sustained management  cycles that involve grazing with or without mowing. Two specific groups of plant assemblage are  included here. Firstly, wetland tall-herb including reedbeds, sedge swamps and tall-herb  dominated gaps in wet woodland plus emergent aquatic vegetation that is often zoned and on the  fringes of waterbodies. The second group includes very diverse ‘clearance’ communities of dry  soils assembling in response to previous unpredictable disturbance. Often found in urban  situations, in woodland gaps and clearfell or on linear features but including setaside – see  guidance notes for further details.  6                5b  Press-disturbance vegetation.  Includes all grazed upland and lowland grasslands along with  meadows and silage fields. Also included are those amenity grasslands which maybe rabbit  grazed but are generally managed by frequent repeated mowing. Also included are areas of  monocot rather than dwarf shrub dominated bogs and heaths – see guidance notes for further  details.  Plant assemblages may reflect wet to dry, acid to calc conditions but the common feature  is that they experience a relatively stable, cyclic disturbance regime where biomass is removed by  annual cutting or/and continuous grazing at varying intensities.   8                6a  Wetland tall herbs frequent to dominant.  6c-g                6b  Wetland tall herbs occasional to absent.  7a-c                6c  Terrestrial vegetation growing on lowland peat soils often with or without scattered Alder or  Willow. Species include Carex paniculata, C. acutiformis, C.rostrata, C.elata, C.riparia, Iris  pseudacorus, Filipendula ulmaria, Phragmites australis (but not virtually pure stands), Equisetum  fluviatile, Eupatorium cannabinum, Lythrum salicaria.

Species include Valeriana  officinalis, Epilobium hirsutum, Filipendula ulmaria, Oenanthe crocata, Stachys palustris and  Lythrum salicaria.  Aquatic marginal  vegetation  (BH 11 Fen, Marsh,  Swamp )   Aquatic  marginal  vegetation              6g  Fertile, wetland tall-herb vegetation with less than 50% grass cover.

Vegetation with over 50% grass cover. Arrhenatherum, Dactylis and  Elymus repens usually dominate but scattered shrubs and tall herbs maybe present particularly  along linear features such as road verges, field boundaries, tracksides and ditchbanks.

CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    27  Mixed Deciduous  Priority Habitat9  (Broadleaved  woodland BH 1)  secondary  attributes see  guidance)    Further guidance notes:    Pulse-disturbance vegetation: This will often be a difficult separation to make but refers to early to mid-successional vegetation that may still be undergoing  species compositional turnover and either assembling in response to a single infrequent disturbance episode such as flooding, drawdown, fire, felling and  natural gap formation in woodlands, or the cessation of disturbance e.g. urban derelict land and gardens, new landfill caps, mine spoils and reclaimed land or  apparently fallow arable. Also included here are the annual to less frequently mown communities of boundaries and linear features including hydroseres  around waterbodies. Local ‘rough’ areas of amenity grassland on school playing fields, golf courses and churchyards may also fall into the groups outlined.  Their defining feature is that indicators of annual or more frequent mowing and prolonged grazing are generally absent. Assemblages here may often be  variable in height but usually typified by tall grasses and herbs not tolerant of grazing or agricultural mowing regimes. Hence, the vegetation is usually more  than 25cm in average height. Variation in species composition may however be large and unpredictable given the dynamic and spontaneous nature of the  colonisation and establishment phases. Even so, nitrophiles will often be very well represented given the association with fertile lowland soils, gardens, arable  land and urban environments. In most situations, the actual area of these kinds of vegetation stands will be <0.25ha and hence below the minimum mappable  unit. Vegetation arising after woodland has been clearfelled can be extensive yet pose a problem in terms of its assignment to habitat types. In upland  plantations that have been harvested, the vegetation will inherit aspects of the pre-existing bog or heath but species richness and vegetated cover maybe low  because only a subset of species are in the seedbank and little time may have elapsed since felling. In addition, the vegetation may be protected from grazing.  This can result in coarse mosaics of regenerating shrubs, bare ground, bryophyte patches and scattered bog and heath plants. Based on the species present,  such areas are likely to be mosaics of other bog, blanket bog and heath. Significant stands of ferns, Chamerion angustifolium and other tall-herbs may warrant  a mosaic with Perennial vegetation, tall herb/grass, which keys out at 7c and has been allocated to the Neutral Grassland BH.    Press-disturbance vegetation: There is no naturally sharp distinction between these communities and pulse-disturbance types. Plant assemblages may reflect  wet to dry, acid to calc conditions but the common feature is that they experience a relatively stable annual disturbance regime where biomass is removed by  annual cutting or/and continuous grazing at varying intensities. Hence, all grazed upland and lowland grasslands are included here along with meadows and  silage fields. Also included are those amenity grasslands which may be rabbit grazed but are generally managed by very frequent mowing. Also included here  are areas of monocot rather than dwarf shrub dominated bogs and heaths that may typically be managed less intensively than agricultural lowland grasslands  but may nevertheless experience frequent, predictable biomass removal by grazing. Surveyors will often find it difficult to effect the separation between 5a  and 5b. This simply reflects real difficulties in establishing mapped boundaries when species vary individualistically and the environment varies  continuously.

KEY TO WOODLAND TYPES/FEATURES CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    29    The woodland descriptions will be used to describe each 'woodland unit' (ranging from a single  sapling to a forestry plantation).  The primary attributes referred to in bold (clump of trees, belt  of trees, woodland/forest) can be assigned to Broad or Priority Habitats (see below). Trees/scrub  should be recorded in any situation except inside the curtilages of buildings or communication routes  (e.g. roads, railways) or as individuals or lines immediately adjacent to non-agricultural curtilages.   Trees should be recorded as points or areas of woodland from all recreation land such as golf courses  and playing fields (except in urban situations).  Tree species (with apical dominance leading to the  formation of recognised trunks) of all sizes should be recorded, as should shrubby species (comprising  scrub).     Cover types - all occurrences of trees should be allocated to one of the forestry feature attributes and  qualified by secondary attributes e.g. species and species cover. If any one area of trees includes  distinct variation in age or species composition the unit should be sub-divided into blocks and coded  separately. CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    30        A digital system has been specially developed for CS2007 and is called CS Surveyor, it is based on a  system developed by the Forestry Commission but has been customised as part of a joint collaboration  between CEH and ESRI. The system development has been very rapid and recent and consequently  has not been as thoroughly tested as we would like so it is possible that surveyors will come across  bugs or issues in the field. PLEASE telephone the helpdesk on 01524 595812 or 0773869398  to discuss problems, you can also log your fault on the Wiki under the fault logging session. Updates  to methodology will appear under the Latest News section and should be checked regularly by  surveyors.  The use of a digital system enables surveyors to ensure that each of the mapped components have  been visited and to record whether change has occurred against each of them. This requirement to  record change will affect the way the mapping is carried out as it is a compulsory element of the  survey enforced by the digital system when any changes are made to mapped habitats and features.   As pointed out in the ‘Background’ section above surveyors will be asked to indicate genuine change  and changes that highlight where, in their opinion, earlier mapping (or subsequent data processing)  resulted in the mis-allocation of polygons (mapped areas), linear features or point features to the  wrong BH. This is a key role for surveyors in this survey as they will be both mapping change as well  as correcting the data.    5. USING THE DIGITAL MAPPING SYSTEM CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    31  Starting ArcMap & CS Surveyor    Open Arcmap using Habitats task manager and clicking on Launch Surveyor application. Choose  square to edit.                                            Basic ArcMap    ArcMap is the GIS program, upon which CS Surveyor is built.  Surveyors are not required to have a basic knowledge of how ArcMap operates, since CS Surveyor  includes all of the tools required to allow capture of all necessary data for the Countryside Survey.  This introduction will illustrate how to navigate around ArcMap and use the tools and buttons needed  to do so. CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    32    The ArcMap Interface    There are two main parts to the ArcMap interface, the Table of Contents, and the Map Display.  The Table of Contents displays Layers of data, which are held in a Data Frame.  The Map Display shows the geographical representation of the data which is held in the Table of  Contents.  The CS Surveyor extension also adds a menu item in the ArcMap interface, to allow the surveyor to  access the main functions of the program.        When ArcMap has started up, start and log on to the CS Surveyor extension. This   is done from the ArcMap toolbar.       The CS Surveyor Extension welcome screen opens. Check that the path to the database is correct,  enter your username and password to log on to the extension. CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    33      When you have successfully logged on, the CS Surveyor Extension loads into the GIS, and shows the  relevant survey square in the map screen.    ArcMap with CS Surveyor        The ArcMap Interface with CS Surveyor running CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    34  When CS Surveyor is started, it automatically loads in the data required to allow the surveyor to view  and edit the location and attributes of point features, linear features, and polygon features.    A data frame named Countryside Survey holds the various data layers with their symbology pre-set to  ensure their visibility, and usability.    Navigation tools and buttons in ArcMap      ArcMap navigation tools and buttons    The Zoom in tool allows the user to click at a chosen point on the map display, the result is the map  zooms in and is re-centred on the clicked point. Alternatively a zoom box can be dragged across the  map display to zoom in to the extent of the box.    The Zoom out tool allows the user to click at a chosen point on the map display, the result is the map  zooms out and is re-centred on the clicked point. Alternatively a zoom box can be dragged across the  map display to zoom out recentred on the box.    The Zoom in button makes the map display zoom in centred on the mid point of the display.    The Zoom out button makes the map display zoom out centred on the mid point of the display.    The Pan tool allows the user to pan the map in any chosen direction over the map display. CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    35  The Zoom to map extent button zooms the map display out so that all layers in the data frame are  displayed. In CS Surveyor this will normally be the extent of the 1km square.    The Go back to previous extent and Go forward to next extent buttons allow the user to scroll back  and forwards between previous and next extents on the map display.     Other tools and buttons in ArcMap tools toolbox      ArcMap navigation tools and buttons    The Select Features tool allows the user to select a feature, or features, from one or more layers of  data in the map display.    The Clear Selected Features button, clears any selected features.    The Select Elements tool allows the selection, moving and resizing of graphics, text and similar  elements.    The Identify tool allows the user to view the attributes of any feature in the map display, without  selecting or de-selecting the feature.    The Find tool allows the user to search for a feature by a particular value of an attribute.    The Go to XY tool allows the user to navigate to a point by entering a set of X and Y co-ordinates.    The Measure tool allows the measurement of approximate lengths and areas on the map display. CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    36      To edit areas you will need to be zoomed in to a scale of < 1:5000    Surveyors will need to click on each polygon in the CS2007 layer and either confirm that the  polygon accurately represents what they see in the field, or change accordingly. Countryside  Survey is primarily concerned with reporting extent and change of Broad and Priority Habitat  types. Spatial accuracy is not a key aspect of the survey and therefore surveyors are asked to  concentrate on the extent to which the data accurately represents the habitats in the survey  square rather than their exact locations. Where necessary, surveyors can indicate errors in  spatial accuracy by changing the attributes and or shapes and sizes of polygons and recording  Error change against those polygons.    The task that surveyors will most commonly be carrying out in the field is checking and  confirming and /or changing the attributes assigned to each polygon by previous surveyors.      Area Editing   Click on the Edit button in the ArcMap toolbar  to begin an edit session. This will open the  Landscape Feature Editing toolbox, which has 3 tabs which enable the user to edit each of  landscape feature types.      Edit button on ArcMap toolbar                                                               Landscape Feature Editing Toolbox    Each feature type has its own selection of tools, these are designed to allow the surveyor to  manipulate features to reflect change in the landscape.  The surveyor can use any of the tools, and edit Areas, Lines, and Points, without leaving an  edit session. Click the Areas tab in the Landscape Feature Editing toolbox:  6. METHODOLOGY FOR MAPPING POLYGONS (HABITAT AREAS) CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    37      The surveyor can edit the attributes of an area, copy attributes from a source to target areas,  split an area, merge areas together, modify the boundaries of areas, and update areas using a  copied shape or digitised sketch .          Checking attributes   The attributes of an area or feature are all the possible descriptors for that feature including;  Broad or Priority Habitat, Change status, habitat type, species and physiography.  The keys  above provide detailed guidance on how to assign areas to particular vegetation types (on the  basis of indicator species physiography and other factors). The listed Broad and Priority  Habitats below provide more detailed habitat descriptions and also indicate where the relevant  attributes for each habitat are to be found within the digital recording system.    Editing Area Attributes    Click on the Attributes tab in the Landscape Feature Editing toolbox.  Zoom or pan to the location on the map display to select an area for attribute update. Select by  clicking or dragging a selection box over it. The selected area is shown highlighted in yellow.  The attribute editor will open, and details should be entered for the area. Fields requiring  mandatory values are shown in orange, and those for which values are optional are shown in  blue if you attempt to move on without filling in a mandatory field you will be given an  error message.      6.a  Editing Area attributes CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    38  6.a.i Polygon Level Attributes                                  Area: the area of the polygon is given    Broad (Priority) habitat: Surveyors should choose the appropriate Broad or Priority  habitat for 2007 using the vegetation key and the additional information on  Broad and Priority habitats. The default setting will be the BH from 1998,  you may need to reassess after viewing the component level attributes so  don’t forget what the original 1998 was.    BH (Broad Habitat) Accuracy – was the polygon allocated to the right BH in 98  (allocation ok)? Were the attributes right or wrong?  • Broad habitat ok, attributes ok  • Broad Habitat ok, attributes wrong  • Broad Habitat wrong, attributes ok  • Broad Habitat wrong, attributes wrong  • New baseline for Priority Habitat (Some of the PH’s were not recorded     separately last time and would have just been recorded as part of the Broad  habitat)  • Not previously surveyed    Reason for Change:   •  Error change- surveyor was mistaken previously  •  No change  •  No previous code  •  Real change CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    39    In the case of error or real change where the polygon can be assigned to new Priority Habitat  it is more important to select Broad Habitat accuracy rather than new baseline which can be  deduced from new map codes.    Visit status:  •  In progress  •  Completed  •  Refused access    6.a.ii Determining Change    It is important that surveyors indicate whether observed changes in primary and  secondary attributes are the result of genuine change since the last surveyor or whether  there was an error previously.                                    a. Does the 1998 allocation still apply? i.e. no change has occurred. If so  leave as is.  b. Does a new allocation apply because change has occurred since 1998?  This is REAL change.  c. Does a new allocation apply because the allocation for 1998 is judged to  have been wrong then and would also be wrong now? This is ERROR  change and amounts to a correction of the 1998 data.  N.B. in unenclosed  habitats habitat descriptor & attribute data comes from the 1990 survey  whereas in enclosed habitats attribute data comes from the 1998 survey. CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    40  Unenclosed habitat data will be 17 years old and appreciable vegetation  change could have occurred. (See attached table/box for guidelines on  significant ecological change). This MUST be taken into consideration  when deciding if change is REAL or ERROR.   d. Does a NEW BASELINE Priority Habitat code apply? In this situation  the new attribute reflects a newly applied subdivision of the surveyed  land-cover. For example, discriminating upland hay meadow from  Neutral grassland even though both are included in the Neutral grassland  BH.     6.a.iii Component Level Attributes    An area may have more than one component. Components can be added, copied, or deleted,  and attributes of components can be edited. These edits are all undertaken in the Landscape  Areas Attribute Editor toolbox.      Area Attribute Editing showing selected area and Attribute Editor dialog    To add a new component, click on an existing component and click the New button in the  attribute editor summary pane on the left.    To copy components, click on an existing component, and click the Copy button in the  attribute editor summary pane. CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    41    To delete a component, click on the component to select it, and click the Delete button.  When two or more components have the same primary attribute e.g. moorland grass then you  can only change the primary attribute if you select all of the same components with the same  attribute, i.e. if you select only one of the components you will only be able to select  secondary attributes such as species.     Areas can only have their attributes updated one area at a time.  Each area must contain at least one component.    Theme – organises primary and secondary attributes into intuitive groups (e.g.  physiography, agriculture/natural vegetation) to make selection easier and control  dependent attributes. On the tablet surveyors will choose the appropriate attributes from  the complete list of attributes under each theme    INLAND PHYSIOGRAPHY: Primary attribute and Physiographic feature cover    INLAND WATER: Primary attribute    COASTAL FEATURE: Primary attribute    AGRICULTURE/NATURAL VEGETATION: associated fields include Primary  attribute, Primary qualifier (optional), vegetation type, Species and Species cover    AGRICULTURAL CROPS: associated fields include Primary attribute (these will  be agriculturally related i.e. mostly crops) , Primary qualifier (optional),  vegetation type, Species and Species cover      AGRICULTURE/NATURAL VEGETATION USE: Primary attribute    FORESTRY: associated fields include Primary attribute, Primary qualifier  (optional), Modal DBH, vegetation type, Species and Species cover    FORESTRY FEATURE: Primary attribute only    FORESTRY USE: Primary attribute only    RECREATION: Primary attribute only    STRUCTURES: Primary attribute only CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    42  TRANSPORT: Primary attribute, road verge a and b.    WIDE LINEAR FEATURE: Primary attribute only    UNSURVEYED/MISSING DATA: No fields    DELETED FEATURE: No fields  Vegetation type – organises species into groups (e.g grasses) to aid selection.  Species – as described.  Cover/proportion – choose from <10%, 10-25%, 25-50%, 50-75%, 75-100%  Primary qualifier –.relates to specific terms which support the primary attribute   e.g. ley, amenity grass, parkland          Choose Copy Attr. Button from Landscape Feature Editing toolbox. Zoom or pan to the  location on the map display to select one or more areas which will be target areas, and have  attributes of another area copied to them.  Select areas by clicking on each area or dragging a selection box over them. The selected  target areas are shown highlighted with a blue hatch. The surveyor can change the selection of  target polygons by clicking on selected areas to de-select them, or clicking on additional areas  to add them to the selection.  Now select an area which will be used as the source area to copy attributes from. The selected  source area will be highlighted with a thick blue boundary.  The surveyor can change the source area chosen by selecting a different source area.                          6.b Copy Area CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    43      Click Copy Attributes. The attributes of the source area will be copied to the target areas.   The attribute editor will open, and details should be checked for each area. Target areas will  now have the same attributes as the source area.    There can only be one source area, there can be many target areas.  Attributes copied to target areas overwrite all currently held attributes at  both area and component level.    Changing shape & size – if the polygon in the data no longer represents the  vegetation patch due to a change in its extent or shape, surveyors will be able to  use the following edit functions:          Click ‘split’ on the edit menu box, click on the select polygon icon,   Zoom or pan to the location on the map display where the area is to be split. Click or drag a  selection box to select the area to be split. The selected area is shown highlighted with a blue  hatch.   Using the sketch tool, digitise the split polygon, ensuring the split line is in the correct  location. Using a series of join-the-dots type editing with the stylus, start just outside the  polygon and touch the screen, lift the stylus off the screen and move to where you want the  next  ‘dot’ to be, carry on across the polygon until you are out the other side, then carry on  until you can complete a polygon that will include all the bit you want to split out. Double tap  to finish (this is not easy and may need a few attempts – if so make sure the stylus hits the  same point). The area which will be split is shown highlighted with a blue/red cross hatch.          Sketch Tool              6.c  Split Areas CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    44        Split Area showing area to be split off    Click split to complete the spatial edit.  If the part to split is too small (i.e. below the minimum mappable unit) it will be highlighted  in bright red.                 Click ‘clear’on the dialogue box and start again.    If everything is OK the part to be split will show in red hatching. The attribute editor will  open, with each part of the split area being highlighted in turn, the surveyor should input  attributes for the split areas to complete the edit.  If you have drawn the shape and it is large enough but you are not happy with the shape and CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    45  want to start again click ‘clear’ on the dialogue box and repeat.     If you want to remove a piece of the polygon you have just created click on the shape with a  minus sign.                      6.c.i Modifying the Edit Sketch     If the edit sketch created to split an area is not satisfactory in terms of shape, then it can be  modified by moving its vertices to create the final shape.  Click on the vertex edit tool, the edit sketch now has vertices shown as edit handles. The edit  sketch can now be modified, with vertices added, deleted, and moved, until the surveyor is  satisfied that the edit sketch will produce the split required.                                      Edit sketch with vertices shown – ready to modify    When you have created the split shape the attribute editor will open, with each part of the split  area being highlighted in turn, the surveyor should input attributes for the split areas to  complete the edit. CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    46                        Split Area – Creating a doughnut polygon    This edit should be done as a standard split, but since the intended result is to cut the split  polygon from within the selected polygon, then it should be digitised accordingly.                                 Split edit sketch to create doughnut polygon CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    47    6.c.ii  Using the Copy Tool    Existing polygons from other map layers, for example OS Mastermap, can be copied and used  to make a Split Area edit sketch polygon.  Zoom or pan to the location on the map display where the area is to be split. Click or drag a  selection box to select the area to be split. The selected area is shown highlighted with a blue  hatch.  Click the Copy button in the Inventory Editing – Split toolbox to open the Copy features  toolbox. Select the layer you wish to copy features from, this must be a polygon layer, and  select the feature you wish to copy.  The selected feature is shown with a heavy blue outline. Click the Copy+ button to include  this feature in the edit sketch, the polygon is now shown with a heavy green outline, to  indicate that it is part of the Split edit sketch. Select other features in the same way, clicking  Copy+ to add more features to the edit sketch, and Copy- to remove features from the edit  sketch.  The edit sketch can be further refined using the edit vertex tool, as described above in  Modifying the Edit Sketch.  Areas to be split are shown with a heavy black outline, and a red/blue cross hatch.      Edit sketch made by using the Copy Features tool    Click split to complete the spatial edit.  The attribute editor will open, with each part of the split area being highlighted in turn, the  surveyor should input attributes for the split areas to complete the edit.   The copy tool is particularly useful if a polygon exists on another map layer, OS Mastermap CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    48  for example, and the surveyor wishes to use this to create an identical polygon within the  Landscape Areas layer. The example shown below illustrates a rectangle, copied from an  external data set named 1212_external_polygons, and ready to be split from the surrounding  Landscape Area polygon.        Edit sketch made by using the Copy Features tool    Areas can only be split one at a time.  A Split can be digitised across and around a polygon to create a simple  split or within a polygon creating a doughnut polygon.        Before carrying out a merge, the surveyor will have satisfied him/her self that the attributes of  the areas to be merged are identical.   Additionally the Reason for Change value must be input, in every area to be merged. Other  mandatory fields will also have to be updated as part of this process. Should the Reason for  Change field not have valid input, then the software will not permit the edit to continue, and  the area when selected will be highlighted in red.  After the polygons have been merged all of which have had their previous reason for change  recorded the new polygon has a mandatory requirement for BH accuracy and  reason for  6.d  Merge Areas CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    49  change even though a new polygon has been created. Surveyors should record BH wrong,  attributes wrong for BH98accuracy and No previous code under reason for change.    Zoom or pan to the location on the map display where the areas are to be merged. Click or  drag a selection box to select the areas to be merged. The selected areas are shown  highlighted with a blue hatch.  If required, select the polygon, from within those selected to merge, whose attributes should  be used in the new merged polygon. (If not, then the merged polygon is given a single  Unsurveyed/Missing Data component, and input is required by the surveyor.)      Areas selected to be merged – using attributes of highlighted area    Click the Merge button to complete the spatial edit.  The attribute editor will open, with the new merged area being highlighted in yellow, the  surveyor should check attributes for the merged area to complete the edit.              Many areas can be merged together, but attributes can only be copied  from one of the areas to be merged.  Attributes copied to merged areas overwrite all currently held attributes at  both area and component level. CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    50        Zoom or pan to the location on the map display where the area is to be modified. Click on or  drag a selection box over the boundary between two polygons, which is to be modified.   The selected boundary is shown highlighted in mauve, and edit handles are shown along its  length. Using the topology edit tool the edit sketch can now be modified, with vertices added,  deleted, and moved, until the surveyor is satisfied that the edit sketch reflects how the  boundary is on the ground.  Note that the vertices at the end of the shared boundary cannot be edited at this point, since  they are shared nodes – they share their topology with other features, and can only be  modified in Shared Node Modify.      Boundary selected for Modify edit    Click to one side of the boundary to see how the edited boundary will be changed as a result  of the edit.  Click Save Changes to save the spatial edit.  The attribute editor will open, with each part of the modified area being highlighted in turn,  the surveyor should input attributes for the split areas to complete the edit.    Shared Nodes – These can only be modified if selected individually as a node, for modify  editing.  Using the topology edit tool, select a shared node to modify by clicking carefully on the node  (use the keyboard shortcut of n to prevent the selection of a boundary rather than the node).  6.e  Modify Area CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    51  The node is shown highlighted in mauve.      Shared node which has been modified – ready to save changes    Drag the node to its new position, the adjoining polygon boundaries will move along with the  node as it is moved.  Click on Save Changes to save the spatial edit.  The attribute editor will open, with each part of the modified area being highlighted in turn,  the surveyor should input attributes for the split areas to complete the edit.      Only the boundary between two polygons is edited using Modify.  The points at the end of an edit boundary are shared nodes, and these can  only be edited using shared node modify.            The update edit creates a new landscape area by splitting existing polygons, and then merging  the split areas together.    Zoom or pan to the location on the map display to create an update polygon.  Digitise an update polygon on the map display, the areas which it intersects are highlighted  with a blue hatch, the new area enclosed by the update polygon is shown highlighted with a  red hatch and a black boundary. Any small areas which are below the minimum permitted  6.f  Update Areas Edit CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    52  polygon size as a result of the update edit are shown in red, and will be merged with an  adjacent polygon when the edit is completed.      Update polygon showing interaction with affected areas    At this stage, the update polygon is an edit sketch, so can be modified using the vertex edit  tool, see instructions for use of this tool in Split Polygon above. Additionally the update  polygon can be created from polygons copied from other layers, for example OS Mastermap,  using the Copy Features Tool. See instructions for use of this tool in Split Polygon above.  One of the polygons intersected by the update edit may be selected to have its attributes  copied into the new update area. Alternatively if no area is chosen, then the new area is  created with a single Unsurveyed/Missing Data component.  When the surveyor is satisfied that the update polygon is the correct shape, click the Update  button to complete the spatial edit.  The attribute editor will open, with each area affected by the update edit being highlighted in  turn, the surveyor should input attributes for the updated, and new areas to complete the edit. CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    53    Attribute edits post update edit    Update can be used in place of a series of Split and Merge edits as an  effective way of including a new area which intersects many existing  areas.  Any landscape area feature which will be deleted as a result of an update  edit, must have a value in the Reason for Change field. CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    54          Stop Editing    At the end of editing in CS Surveyor, the Landscape Feature Editing toolbox will be open, as  shown below.      The surveyor has two options to exit from the CS Surveyor edit session, Save Session, and  End Session.  Click on Save Session in order to save the edits which have been undertaken and stop editing.    NOTHING THAT YOU HAVE DONE WILL BE SAVED UNLESS YOU CLICK ON  SAVE SESSION. YOU SHOULD COME OUT OF YOUR SESSION AND SAVE  CHANGES AT REGULAR INTERVALS.                A confirmation dialog opens     Click Yes to end the edit session, and save all changes.  7.

In this next section detailed descriptions of Broad and Priority and ‘other’ Habitats to which  the key leads are given. Within each Broad Habitat primary and secondary attributes relevant  to that Broad Habitat are listed by the theme under which they appear on the tablet.  [N.B.  after each attribute below, the permitted recording unit i.e. Area, Line or Point is indicated by  the letters, A, L and P]    Non-Native species  There is concern about the prevalence of invasive non-native species in the countryside. We  would like surveyors to look out for the following non-natives and to record them where they  occur within a habitat (and cover an area over the MMU). Note that occurrences of these  species can also be used to qualify mapped areas of any habitat type.      8. BROAD & PRIORITY HABITATS and PRIMARY AND SECONDARY ATTRIBUTES FOR  POLYGONS (MAPPED AREAS)   General rules for mapping areas    1.  If a polygon contains woodland with a continuous cover it always goes to a woodland  Broad/Priority habitat regardless of other components.    2.  The minimum mappable area is 1/25th ha (400m2)- 20m x 20m, the feature measures at least   5m in all directions e.g. 5m x 80m (otherwise it is a length and marked with a line). No  vegetation should be mapped as a separate unit unless it comprises this area.     3.  The ONLY case in which an area <MMU should be mapped is where part of a much larger  bigger polygon e.g. a field of wheat, protrudes into the edge of a square. The system will  prevent you from creating an area which is less than the MMU.    4.  A new polygon should be created when a new habitat occurs i.e. if a primary attribute/habitat  type changes. If there is a change in species composition but this does not lead to a change in  habitat type then a new polygon should not be created.    5. Only features above a minimum mappable unit in size (i.e. exceeding 1/25th ha) excepting  ponds should be recorded within woodland.    6. For each Habitat type you should record at least two species even if they are of low cover, the  maximum number of species to be recorded is 4. CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    57      Brassica napus (rape)  Buddleia davidii  Epilobium brunnescens  Heracleum mantegazzianum  Impatiens glandulifera  Mimulus guttatus  Reynoutria japonica  Rhododendron ponticum  Symphoricarpos albus    Woodland Broad and Priority Habitats    Areas of woodland (polygons) should be assigned to the following two Broad or Priority  Habitats. Woodland is different to other habitat types because as well as being assigned a  habitat type it can also be described as a feature or ‘type’ of woodland e.g. belt of trees,  scattered trees etc (see key above). Broad or Priority Habitat can be assigned at both the  polygon and component levels. At the component level the feature or ‘type’ of woodland is  the primary attribute and the habitat type can be a primary qualifier (see below). This is  particularly useful where a mosaic of woodland types within one Broad Habitat is recorded.               This Broad Habitat is used for broadleaf woodland which does not fall into PH. The  Broadleaved Mixed and Yew Woodland BH includes Ulex europaeus scrub but not U.gallii  or U.minor scrub.    Note that if any one area of trees includes distinct variation in age or species composition,  then the unit should ONLY be sub-divided into blocks and coded separately if there is a  change in habitat type. For example, simply going from an elm to sycamore dominated patch  would not warrant a new polygon boundary but if it was from sycamore to beech-dominated  this would key out as a patch of Broadleaved Woodland BH plus a patch of Lowland Beech  PH hence the two polygons would need to be identified as separate units.    Priority Habitats  Lowland beech and yew woodland  Beech can grow on both acidic and calcareous soils, although its association with yew tends  to be most abundant on the calcareous sites.  In the UK beech is considered native only in  9. BROAD HABITAT 1: BROADLEAVED MIXED AND YEW WOODLAND CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    58  southern England and southern Wales. The canopy can include mixtures of beech, ash,  sycamore (non-native), oak, yew and whitebeam. In some areas, this woodland type occurs as  intricate mosaics with lowland mixed deciduous woods. Bramble (Rubus fruticosus) forms a  characteristic ground layer on neutral-slightly acidic soils. Holly is the main understorey  species, less often yew, on acidic soils. It is common in (but not confined to) the High and  Low Weald, the Chilterns plateau, the New Forest, the Cotswolds and the Wye Valley. The  main corresponding National Vegetation Classification (NVC) plant communities associated  with this habitat type are W12 Fagus sylvatica - Mercurialis perennis woodland (base-rich  soils), W14 Fagus sylvatica - Rubus fruticosus woodland (mesotrophic soils), W15 Fagus  sylvatica - Deschampsia flexuosa woodland (acidic soils). Yew stands fall into W13 Taxus  baccata woodland.    Lowland wood-pasture and parkland  The presence of this habitat type will be determined post-survey. However there is a parkland  secondary forest attribute which surveyors can apply to indicate mature trees scattered across  typically grazed grasslands in an extensive managed estate setting.    Upland mixed ashwoods  The term upland mixed ashwoods is used for woods on base-rich soils in the north and west,  in most of which ash is a major species, although locally oak, birch, elm, small-leaved lime  and even hazel may be the most abundant species. Yew may form small groves in intimate  mosaics with the other major tree species and alder may occur where there are transitions to  wet woodland. Upland in the name reflects the abundance of this type of woodland on base- rich soils in upland Britain rather than to the altitude at which individual sites occur indeed  some are only just above sea level.    In terms of National Vegetation Classification (NVC) plant communities this habitat is  characterised by W8 Fraxinus excelsior - Acer campestre - Mercurialis perennis woodland,  sub communities d. Hedera helix, e. Geranium robertianum, f. Allium ursinum and g.  Teucrium scorodonia, and W9 Fraxinus excelsior - Sorbus aucuparia - Mercurialis perennis  woodland, together with W13 Taxus baccata woodland for the yew groves on the  Carboniferous and Magnesian limestones. Less frequent sub-communities that may occur in  mosaic with the above are the relatively dry alder- ash stands W7c and the more southerly and  eastern sub-communities of W8 (a-c).    Upland oakwood  Upland oakwoods are characterised by a predominance of oak (most commonly sessile, but  locally pedunculate) and birch in the canopy, with varying amounts of holly, rowan and hazel  as the main understorey species. The amount of birch in the woods tends to increase in north- west Scotland.  Most oakwoods also contain areas of more alkaline soils, often along streams  or towards the base of slopes where much richer communities occur, with ash and elm in the CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    59  canopy. It is found throughout the north and west of the UK with major concentrations in  Argyll and Lochaber, Cumbria, Gwynedd, Devon and Cornwall.    Wet woodland  Wet woodland occurs on poorly drained or seasonally wet soils, usually with alder, birch and  willows as the predominant tree species, but sometimes including ash, oak, pine and beech on  the drier riparian areas. It is found on floodplains, as successional habitat on fens, mires and  bogs, along streams and hill-side flushes, and in peaty hollows. Wet woods frequently occur  in mosaic with other woodland key habitat types  and with open key habitats such as fens. In  terms of National Vegetation Classification (NVC) plant communities this habitat is  characterised by W1 Salix cinerea - Galium palustre woodland, W2 Salix cinerea - Betula  pubescens - Phragmites australis woodland, W3 Salix pentandra - Carex rostrata woodland,  W4c Betula pubescens - Molinia caerulea woodland: Sphagnum sub-community, W5 Alnus  glutinosa - Carex paniculata woodland, W6 Alnus glutinosa - Urtica dioica woodland, and  W7 Alnus glutinosa - Fraxinus excelsior - Lysimachia nemorum woodland. Some birch stands  classified as W4 are relatively dry and in management terms better treated alongside other  extensive birch stands. As a provisional division, sub-communities W4a and W4b are better  associated with Upland/Northern Birchwoods.     Broad and Priority Habitats are selected at the polygon level. At the component level all  woodland attributes should be recorded under the Forestry theme in the following fields;    Theme: Forestry  Primary attribute: (one from)  Belt of scrub (A, L): 2 to 4 bushes wide with a width to length ratio of at least 1:4, parallel- sided and with a maximum width of 50m. Linear feature if <5m wide.  Belt of trees (A, L): 2 to 4 trees wide with a width to length ratio of at least 1:4, parallel-sided  and with a maximum width of 50m. Linear feature if <5m wide.   Belt of trees width > 20m (A): 2 to 4 trees wide with a width to length ratio of at least 1:4,  parallel-sided and with a maximum width of 50m. Width of belt >20m.  Clump of trees: a small woodland or group of trees (6 or more) and of less than 0.25 ha.   Dead lying trees (A, L, P)  Dead standing tree(s) (A, L, P): recorded either singly or as a description for an area of  woodland.   Patch of scrub (A, P): an area of continuous scrub (canopy >25%) of any size consisting  exclusively of shrubby species or trees in shrubby form, often with tree regeneration.  Individual trees of more than twice the average height of the scrub should be separately  marked as individuals or scattered.   Ploughed: to be used where land has been ploughed (or scarified) and fenced in advance of  forestry planting. Should not be used once planting has taken place.  Ride/firebreak CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    60  Woodland/Forest (A): an area of trees of more than 0.25 ha (but see Belt) and a crown cover  of more than 20% (see 285 for areas fenced and ploughed ready for afforestation).   Primary qualifier: All of the above Broad and Priority Habitats and:  Parkland: a series of isolated mature trees over usually grazed grassland, often associated  with large country houses or recreational areas.   Null    Modal DBH: should be used in conjunction with any of the species attributes describing  either individuals or areas of shrubs or trees and, in the case of areas refers to the average  DBH of the species making up the top canopy. This should be recorded in the following  categories: <3cm, 3-20cm, 21-50cm, 51-75cm, >75cm.    Vegetation type: Trees    Species:  Alder   Ash   Beech   Birch   Bramble   Elder   Elm  Field maple  Gorse  Hawthorn   Hornbeam   Lime   Oak   Poplar   Rowan   S.Chestnut   Sycamore   Willow         Mixed Broadleaved: This attribute indicated that the stand was not associated with a  woody dominant that covered >25% of the canopy. This attribute may still apply but in  any event the stand needs to have new information provided that indicates at least 1 but  up to 4 of the most abundant species in the canopy.   Unspecified Broadleaf: (do NOT give species).    Species Cover: these are for use with the tree species attributes and should refer to the  percentage cover of the dominant canopy layer, as if viewed from above. No more than three  attributes should be used to describe the canopy of any one polygon. This should be recorded  in the following categories: <10%, 10-25%, 25-50%, 50-75%, 75-95%, 95-100%.    Associated features of  woodland which should be added as additional components  where relevant under the themes, Forestry Features and Forestry Use are listed below.    Theme: Forestry Features  Primary attribute(s): (one from)  Deer fences  Felling/Stumps: (coppice should be recorded here)   Fenced (single trees)   Grazing (stock): to be used if there is any evidence of agricultural stock using the feature for CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    61  grazing.   Grazing/browsing (non-stock): to be used if there is any evidence of grazing,   Grey squirrel damage  Natural regeneration: to be used only where tree species <1.3m high, which have grown  naturally from seed (or suckers) are outside the canopy of a dominant woodland feature.   Open glade and rides     Pheasants and pheasant pens  Planted: Planted may be used with any of the cover types where it is obvious that planting  has taken place, rather than self-seeding.   Pollarded/Shredded  Regrowth - cut stump: applies to isolated regenerating trees   Signs of recent management  Staked trees: to be used for isolated trees only and not where 288 applies.   Tree protectors: light-weight plastic tubes (about 1 m high) which provide protection as well  as a favourable micro-climate for planted trees.   Underplanting: where semi-natural woodland has been under-planted with standard exotic or  native species.   Windblow: can be used to qualify an area of forest or a single individual which has clearly  been blown over, or had the top blown out, by wind.     Theme: Forest Use   Primary attribute(s): (one from)  Landscape   Nature conservation   Public recreation  Sporting   Shelterbelt   Timber production    Guidance notes for Orchards     Surveyors need to be aware that there is a new emphasis on recording orchards in CS2007 as  traditional orchards are under consideration to be a PH. This will require adding information  to existing attribute data in an attempt to locate traditional orchards. This will usually mean  simply adding Orchard (found under Theme: Agricultural Crops) to an existing polygon  mapped as scrub, woodland or scattered trees.    Although the vegetation of interest will include trees or shrubs, individuals will vary in their CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    62  density so that when a stand was mapped it may have been mapped with a non-woody  attribute and BH  plus a scattered trees forestry attribute, or mapped entirely as woodland or  scrub. In both cases, information can be used to infer the management intensity of the stand  and hence a possible separation of traditional from modern intensive orchards. The Orchard  attribute should therefore always be applied as an additional attribute. In intensive orchards  where bare herbicide-cleared soil is present between trees, the BH should be Arable and  Horticulture and the primary attribute should be Orchard.    Where orchards occur as part of curtilage around houses and farm buildings, use  Gardens/ground with trees as the habitat descriptor and orchard as an additional attribute.          The Broad Habitat includes all coniferous woodland that is not native pine woodland PH.    Priority Habitat  Native pine woodland  Native pine woodlands are relict indigenous forests dominated by self-sown Pinus sylvestris  which occur throughout the central and north-eastern Grampians and in the northern and  western Highlands of Scotland. The main tree species is Scots pine although birches Betula  spp., rowan Sorbus aucuparia, alder Alnus glutinosa, willows Salix spp., bird cherry Prunus  padus are also found. Sessile oak Quercus petracea also occurs infrequently, mainly in the  north-east of Scotland. A shrub understorey, where browsing levels are low, includes  common juniper Juniperus communis, aspen Populus tremula, holly Ilex aquifolium and hazel  Corylus avellana.     Broad and Priority Habitats are selected at the polygon level. At the component level all  woodland attributes should be recorded under the Forestry theme in the following fields;  Theme: Forestry  Primary attribute: as for BH 1    Primary Qualifier: Broad and Priority Habitat as above, parkland.    Modal DBH: as for BH     Vegetation Type: Trees    10. BROAD HABITAT 2: CONIFEROUS WOODLAND CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    63      Species:  Fir - Douglas   Larch   Pine - Corsican   Pine - Lodgepole   Pine - Scots   Spruce - Norway   Spruce - Sitka   Unspecified conifer   Mixed conifers: This attribute indicated that the stand was not associated with a  woody dominant that covered >25% of the canopy. This attribute may still apply but  in any event the stand needs to have new information provided that indicates at least 1  but up to 4 of the most abundant species in the canopy.     Species Cover: as for BH 1                 See also associated features of  woodland under the themes, Forestry Features and  Forestry Use as listed under BH 1 (above). CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    64  11.  BROAD HABITAT 3: BOUNDARIES AND LINEAR FEATURES    Most features will be assigned to this BH post-survey. This is because membership of the BH  is determined by the type of attribute eg. fence, hedge etc. Where a combination of linear  features is wide enough to form an area e.g. ditch, line of trees, fence, wall, then these should  be mapped as areas and assigned to this Broad Habitat.  The Broad Habitat is selected at the  polygon level.     Theme: Wide Linear feature  Primary attribute:  Wide linear feature: this should be used either where a single event (see Mapping linear  features section) on a linear feature is greater than 5m wide and so should be recorded as an  area or where there are multiple events on a linear feature which combined are greater than  5m in width (see below). The events will be recorded in the linear mapping.       12. BROAD HABITAT 4: ARABLE AND HORTICULTURAL    The primary attributes for this BH are straightforward - young crops may be difficult to  recognise (the notes following each attribute may help). The Broad Habitats is selected at the  polygon level. At the component level all attributes should be recorded under the three  agricultural themes in the following fields;    Theme: Agricultural Crops  Primary attribute(s): (one from)  Barley (A): - barley has dull green leaves and auricles.   Blanket herbicide (A)  Commercial horticulture (A): to include strawberries, salad crops, cabbages and onions etc.  Evening primrose (A)  Field Beans (A)  Flowers (A) CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    65  Hemp (A)  Kale (A)  Maize (A)   Miscanthus (A)  Oats (A): oat plants have broad soft glaucous leaves with no auricles.   Oilseed rape (A)   Orchard (A): commercial enterprises only – not to include, for example a few fruit trees in a  back garden where orchards occur as part of curtilage (see note below) around houses and  farm buildings, use Gardens/ground with trees as the primary attribute and Orchard as the  secondary.  Other crop (A)    Peas (A)  Perennial crops (A): to include raspberries, currents and vineyards.  Phacelia (A)  Ploughed (A): the crop harvested before ploughing should be identified (from fragments that  remain) and this attribute used as an extra description after the crop primary attribute. If no  crop fragments can be found then use this as a primary attribute.  Potatoes (A)  Rye (A)  Stubble (A)  Sugar beet (A)  Turnips/Swedes/Roots (A)   Undersown crop (A): may be organic, often cereal crops undersown with a lolium  perenne/trifolium repens ley.   Unidentified cereal (A)  Wheat (A): wheat plants have broad, glaucous blades with auricles    Primary qualifier:  Field edge/Headland  Null    Vegetation type: Null    Species: Null     Species cover: Null    Theme: Agriculture/Natural Vegetation  Primary attribute:  Annual/early successional with open ground (A):  includes unsown setaside and apparently CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    66  fallow land dominated by annual weed species often with much open ground present.  Perennials may be present but if they are a significant component of the vegetation cover it  implies greater time since last disturbed and a Neutral Grassland category would likely be  more appropriate. This code should be used as the primary and an additional agricultural use  code can be used to signify setaside.  Setaside (A): Set-aside is arable land which has been temporarily removed from production  to allow the farmer to qualify for Arable Area Payments. While there are various technical  kinds of set-aside, the main points to note that:  •  it can be whole or part of a field; if the latter, it must be at least 20 m wide;  •  most set-aside is first-year, which comprises a mixture of crop volunteers and arable  weeds (this is characteristic); much will already have been sprayed with non-selective  herbicides to give a dead, yellow cover, which can hide populations of seedlings;  •  older set-aside is more grassy, and more difficult to identify with confidence; if the  cover is patchy, with cereals and arable plants among grasses, it is likely to be set- aside;  There are a range of covers in set-aside (grass, crop mixtures, industrial crops) which cannot  be identified as set-aside from the field evidence alone - only the farmer will know. As it is  impossible to be sure that an area of land is setaside apart from receiving confirmation from  the farmer it would be better to use the primary attribute above.  Primary qualifier: do not record or Null    Vegetation type: likely to be Forbs or Grasses    Species: BRC list dependent on vegetation type chosen    Species cover: categories as above    Other features on arable land – Margins    Agricultural margins will be recorded according to their composition. The most common  types of margin likely to be encountered are perennial grass margins, with or without  supplementary wildflowers. These margins will recorded as areas of Neutral and or Improved  grassland.  Other rarer types include:  •  Uncropped strips, usually cultivated each year;  •  Wild bird seed cover e.g. kale, quinoa  •  Pollen and nectar mixes, usually with a high proportion of legumes;  The most popular margin options are likely to be 6m in width and these may be additive, i.e.  one type of 6m margin immediately adjacent to another type. They should be mapped as areas  where they exceed the MMU. CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    67  13.  BROAD HABITAT 5: IMPROVED GRASSLAND    This is an extensive Broad Habitat comprising of low botanical quality grassland with high  grazing value. The Broad Habitat is selected at the polygon level. At the component level all  attributes should be recorded under the Agriculture/Natural vegetation and the  Agriculture/Natural vegetation use themes in the following fields;  Theme: Agriculture/Natural Vegetation  Primary Attribute(s):  Fertile grass (A): Species-poor, grass dominated swards, often sown for agricultural or  recreational use, or created by modification of unimproved grasslands by fertilisers and  selective herbicides. They are particularly characterised by the abundance of rye grass Lolium  spp. and white clover Trifolium repens. Amenity grasslands e.g. playing fields should also be  recorded in this BH but should also be recorded as amenity grassland.    Primary Qualifier(s): (one from)  Ley: a short-term grassland, re-seeded less than five years previously. Characterised by  evidence of ploughing, bare soil between grass plants, scarcity of broadleaf species and is  often dominated by a single grass species eg Lolium. This attribute should only be used if  there is absolutely no doubt about these factors (eg from landowner information or recent  sowing). Any field with more than 10% Lolium multiflorum (a short-lived ley species) would  be included here.   Amenity grass >1ha (A): This should be used as a secondary descriptor with fertile or neutral  grassland as a primary. It is used to describe non-agricultural grass which is clearly being  used for amenity purposes (not recreation); to be recorded in units of 1ha or more eg parks,  large lawns etc. Golf courses should be recorded separately.  Mown: to be used for any grassland type that has been mown such that the 'normal' vegetative  structure of grasses is not present and therefore hinders species identification.   Anthills on grassland  Ridge and furrow present  Null    Vegetation type: likely to be Grasses.    Species: In previous surveys major agricultural grasses and semi-natural ground cover species  were recorded if they covered 25% or more of a mapped unit, irrespective of the number of  canopies present (ie total cover can reach more than 100%). This meant that species rich  parcels where no species reached 25% had no associated species recorded. We would like  surveyors to include at least 2 species for each polygon even if they are present at <10% cover  (N.B. This means having at least 2 components for each polygon containing major  agricultural grasses and semi-natural ground cover species). This ensures that ALL vegetated CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    68  polygons are associated with at least 2 species records. Where there are more than 2 abundant  species the maximum number to be recorded will be 4. A comprehensive BRC species list  will be available to select from, but will depend on the vegetation type selected.    Species Cover: These cover % attributes should be used with the species attributes and,  where a mosaic of vegetation categories exists, with land cover types. Usually, no more than  four cover attributes may be used to describe any area. This should be recorded in the  following categories: <10%, 10-25%, 25-50%, 50-75%, 75-95%, 95-100%.    Theme:Agriculture/Natural vegetation Use  Beef: cattle which tend to be of stocky build and do not have udders - should also include  'sucklers' (0-6 mths) and 'rearers' (6 mths onwards)   Cattle (unspecified): only to be used if it is not possible to determine whether the cattle are  dairy or beef (note: this attribute was used for ‘breeder’ cattle in 1990).   Dairy: cattle which have udders – especially Fresians –   Deer: only to be used if there is firm evidence including presence of animals or dung,  artificial feeds, estate information   Goats   Hay: should only be used if there is firm evidence eg wisps of dry grass after harvesting.  If  there it is impossible to tell whether a field has been left for hay or silage, then both attributes  should be used, rather than not using a attribute.  Horses  Pigs  Sheep  Silage: Silage fields can be distinguished from hay fields only after cutting (silage-cut stems  are fresh, bright green: hayfields usually produce dried grass remnants), or by asking the  farmer.   Use unknown (A): should be used if the primary use of the land cannot be identified.          This Broad Habitat covers a wide range of vegetation types. The Broad Habitat is selected at  the polygon level. At the component level all attributes should be recorded under the  Agriculture/Natural vegetation theme.    Priority Habitats  Lowland hay meadow  Cover of grass species and clover are usually less than 50%. Typically rich in forb species  with frequent PH lowland meadow indicators including Lathyrus pratensis, Lotus  14.  BROAD HABITAT 6: NEUTRAL GRASSLAND CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    69  corniculatus, Leucanthemum vulgare, Galium verum, Primula veris, Centaurea nigra,  Leontodon hispidus, Ranunculus bulbosus or on flood meadows some of  Caltha palustris,  Sanguisorba officinalis, Filipendula ulmaria and Alopecurus pratensis.      Upland hay meadow  The habitat comprises the single NVC community MG3, Anthoxanthum odoratum -  Geranium sylvaticum grassland and is characterised by a dense growth of grasses and  herbaceous dicotyledons up to 60 - 80 cm high.    Broad Habitat: Neutral grassland     Theme: Agriculture/Natural Vegetation  Primary attribute(s): (one from)    Perennial vegetation: tall herb/grass(A): Vegetation containing some annual weeds but  consisting mainly of long lived perennials with  grass cover less than  <50% cover. Species  include Urtica dioica, Galium aparine, Chamanerion angustifolium, Cirsium arvense,  Bromus sterilis and Poa trivialis. Includes stands dominated by invasive aliens such as  Reynoutria japonica, Impatiens glandulifera and Heracleum mantegazzanium.   Recently sown neutral grass(A): Recently sown mixtures of fine-leaved grasses such as  Anthoxanthum, Poa pratensis, Festuca rubra, Cynosurus and Trisetum. 50-100% grass cover.   Herb species rare or absent. Often on sown field margins.  Semi-improved Neutral grassland (A): This includes all semi-improved and unimproved  grassland occurring on circum-neutral soils.  It includes enclosed and managed grassland such  as pastures, a range of grasslands which are inundated with water periodically, permanently  moist or even waterlogged grassland, where the vegetation is dominated by grasses, and tall  and unmanaged grassland. There was no category ‘neutral grassland’ in previous surveys so  many areas of this type of grassland may have been described as fertile grass and may have  been assigned either to the Improved or Neutral grassland BHs.    Tall unmanaged neutral grass(A): Long-lived perennials with little or no open ground.  Vegetation with over 50% grass cover. Arrhenatherum, Dactylis and Elymus repens usually  dominate but scattered shrubs and tall herbs may be present (eg. Artemisia vulgaris, Cirsium  arvesis, Cirsium vulgare, Digitalis purpurea, Heracleum sphondylium, Chamaerion  angustifolium N.B. does not include wetland indicators e.g.Filipendula ulmaria, Epilobium  hirsutum, Urtica dioica, Filipendula ulmaria, Phragmites). Associated with linear features  such as road verges, field boundaries, tracksides and ditchbanks but in these situations will  only be mapped if >MMU or >5m wide. CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    70  Priority Habitats     Theme: Agriculture/Natural Vegetation  Primary attribute(s):  Lowland hay meadow  Upland hay meadow    Primary Qualifier(s): (if required, one from)  Ley    Amenity grass  Mown  Anthills on grassland  Ridge and furrow present  Null    Vegetation type: likely to be Grasses/Forbs.

The Broad Habitat is selected at the polygon level. At the  component level all attributes should be recorded under the Agriculture/Natural vegetation  theme.    Priority Habitats  Lowland calcareous grassland  This PH is defined as the first nine calcareous grassland National Vegetation Classification  communities, CG1 to CG9. With the exception of CG9, Sesleria albicans - Galium sterneri  grassland, which straddles both lowlands and uplands, these communities are largely  restricted to the warmer and drier climates of the southern and eastern areas of the United  Kingdom.     Upland calcareous grassland  Most examples occur above 250-300 m altitude, but the habitat is also found within  unenclosed moorland at lower elevations, and descends to sea level in north-west Scotland. It  comprises the NVC communities CG9 to CG14. These include upland forms of Sesleria CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    71  albicans grassland (CG9), Festuca ovina - Agrostis capillaris swards (CG10, CG11 and  CG12), and Dryas octopetala communities (CG13 and CG14). Montane forms of calcareous  grassland are often enriched by a distinctive assemblage of Arctic-Alpine plants, such as  Alchemilla alpina, Polygonum viviparum and Silene acaulis.    Theme: Agriculture/Natural Vegetation  Broad habitat  Primary attribute:  Calcareous grassland (A): Vegetation with scattered sedges, many calcicoles present in  often species rich turf on calcareous soils usually rendzinas on chalk or limestone. Indicators  include Bromopsis erecta, Lotus corniculatus, Linum catharticum, Sanguisorba minor,  Carlina vulgaris, Sesleria albicans, Helianthemum nummularium, Cirsium acaule. These  vary from mostly coastal grasslands through to upland and mountain grasslands rich in arctic- alpines.

At the component level all attributes  should be recorded under the Agriculture/Natural vegetation theme.    Priority Habitat  Lowland acid grassland   It is defined as both enclosed and unenclosed acid grassland throughout the UK lowlands CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    72  (normally below c. 300m). Includes the Festuca ovina - Agrostis capillaris - Rumex  acetosella (U1), Deschampsia flexuosa (U2), Agrostis curtisii (U3) and Festuca ovina -  Agrostis capillaris - Galium saxatile (U4) NVC grassland plant communities. Inland  vegetation, but not coastal dunes. It is characterised by a range of plant species such as  Galium saxatile Festuca ovina, Agrostis capillaris, Rumex acetosella, Carex arenaria,  Deschampsia flexuosa, Agrostis curtisii and Potentilla erecta, with presence and abundance  depending on community type and locality.     Theme: Agriculture/Natural Vegetation  Broad habitat Acid grassland  Primary attribute(s):  Acid grassland (A): Fine grasses predominate in generally in dry situations eg. Agrostis  curtisii, Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum odoratum usually on brown podzolic soils or  rankers. Acid indicators present eg. Galium saxatile, Potentilla erecta, Pleurozium schreberi  and Rumex acetosella  Moorland grass (A): Dominated by coarser grass species, usually occurring in a moorland  setting but is also present within lowland heath landscapes in southern Britain and in the  Scottish lowlands.  Usually dominated by Nardus or Molinia but often with significant  amounts of Deschampsia flexuosa and Juncus squarrosus.  Sphagnum species may be present  but if so, associated with Anthoxanthum odoratum and/or Juncus species.  Dwarf shrubs and  peatland species may be frequent but are usually less than 25% cover and are never dominant.   Usually on peaty gley soils but also on some peats.

BROAD HABITAT 9: BRACKEN    The Broad Habitat is selected at the polygon level. At the component level all attributes  should be recorded under the Agriculture/Natural vegetation theme. As this Broad Habitat is  defined by a very high cover of one species very few other attributes are required.    Theme: Agriculture/Natural Vegetation  Primary attribute:  Bracken: This primary descriptor should only be used where vegetation consists of Bracken  at >=95% cover with or without a sparse herbaceous understorey.  Stands that have not yet  peaked in seasonal biomass should still be recorded as dense Bracken if you believe peak  cover is likely to be at least 95%.  If cover of bracken is less than this then it should be  recorded as the underlying vegetation (probably acid grassland) with bracken as a species and  its cover value recorded.

The Priority Habitats  are upland and lowland dwarf shrub heath, these will be allocated post survey using a  GIS mask.    Theme: Agriculture/Natural Vegetation  Primary attribute:  Dwarf shrub heath (A): Includes vegetation dominated by species from the heath family or  dwarf gorse species. It includes the moss and lichen dominated heaths of the East Anglian  Breckland but not of mountain summits which should be included in the "Montane habitats"  BH type. Heathland characterised by presence of Erica spp., Calluna, Empetrum, Vaccinium  or Ulex minor/gallii. Dry and wet heath are included in this category so there may be  occasional to frequent indicators of wet conditions such as Erica tetralix, Sphagnum, Molinia  and/or Narthecium but wet heath differentiated from blanket bog by absence of species of  wet/deeper peats.

BROAD HABITAT 11: FEN/MARSH/SWAMP    This BH includes vegetation that is ground water fed; and permanently, seasonally or  periodically waterlogged on peat, peaty or mineral soils where grasses do not predominate. It  also includes emergent vegetation or frequently inundated vegetation occurring over peat or  mineral soils. The Broad Habitat is selected at the polygon level. At the component level all  attributes should be recorded under the Agriculture/Natural vegetation theme.    Priority Habitats  Fen Priority Habitat  This habitat includes the  primary attributes Fen and/or Flush: Fen: Fens are minerotrophic  peatlands that receive water and nutrients from the soil, rock and ground water. Species  include Carex paniculata, C. acutiformis, C.rostrata, C.elata, C.riparia, Iris pseudacorus,  Filipendula ulmaria, Phragmites australis (but not virtually pure stands), Equisetum  fluviatile, Eupatorium cannabinum, Lythrum salicaria and Epilobium hirsutum. Flush:  Localised, usually narrow areas (which may coalesce where adjacent) influenced by lateral  water movement.  Calcareous flushes are dominated by species such as Linum catharticum,  Carex hostiana and C. dioica, Campyllium stellatum and Parnassia palustris.  Non- calcareous flushes are usually dominated by Juncus effusus, J articulatus/acutiflorus and  Carex echinata, often with Sphagnum.  Usually found on peaty gley soils.    Purple moor grass rush pasture  Purple moor grass and rush pastures occur on poorly drained, usually acidic soils in lowland  areas of high rainfall in western Europe. Purple moor grass Molinia caerulea, and rushes,  especially sharp-flowered rush Juncus acutiflorus, are usually abundant. Key species  associated with purple moor grass and rush pastures include: Hypericum undulatum, Carum CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    75  verticillatum, Cirsium dissectum, Crepis paludosa, Platanthera chlorantha, Galium palustre,  Cirsium palustre,  Ranunculus flammula, Agrostis canina, Mentha aquatica, Achillea  ptarmica, Equisetum palustre, Cardamine pratensis, Epilobium palustre, Juncus  subnodulosus, Carex pulicaris, C.hostiana, Epipactis palustris, Geum rivale, Gymnadenea  conopsea, Serratula tinctoria and Angelica sylvestris.     Reedbed  Reedbeds are wetlands dominated by stands of the common reed Phragmites australis,  wherein the water table is at or above ground level for most of the year. They tend to  incorporate areas of open water and ditches, and small areas of wet grassland and carr  woodland may be associated with them.     Theme: Agriculture/Natural Vegetation  Broad Habitat Fen, Marsh, Swamp  Primary attribute(s):  Aquatic marginal veg (A): vegetation fringing open water often developed as a narrow part  of a hydrosere between standing water and upslope vegetation. Species include Valeriana  officinalis, Epilobium hirsutum, Filipendula ulmaria, Oenanthe crocata.  Marsh (A): Nutrient-rich wetland on predominantly inorganic soil dominated by rushes or  sedges.  Commonly found indicative species are Juncus artic./acutiflorus and J. effusus.   Carex panicea, C. demissa, C. nigra, C. flacca  and C. hostiana; Iris pseudacorus frequently  present, particularly in west. Found on wet, mineral soils.

BROAD HABITAT 12 : BOG    The Broad Habitat is selected at the polygon level. At the component level all attributes  should be recorded under the Agriculture/Natural vegetation and Inland Physiography themes.    Priority Habitats  Blanket bog   The term blanket 'bog' strictly applies only to that portion of a blanket 'mire' which is  exclusively rain-fed. Peat depth is very variable, with an average of 0.5-3 m being fairly  typical but depths in excess of 5 m not unusual. The principal vegetation (NVC) types  covered are M1, M2, M3, M15, M17, M18, M19, M20 and M25, together with their  intermediates. Other communities, such as flush, fen and swamp types, also form an integral  part of the blanket bog landscape but should be mapped separately if areas are greater than the  MMU (20x20m) Dominant species include Calluna vulgaris, Erica tetralix, Trichophorum  cespitosum, Eriophorum vaginatum and Sphagnum species, Rubus chamaemorus is typically,  although not exclusively, confined to high altitude bogs, Arctostaphylos alpinus to northern  bogs, and Schoenus nigricans, as an ombrotrophic species, to western bogs. Even the various  bog moss Sphagnum species, which are a constant element of most blanket bog communities,  are not entirely cosmopolitan and indeed are largely replaced by Racomitrium lanuginosum  over extensive areas in the north and west, particularly in the Western Isles. For mapping  purposes, the most important defining feature is dominant to occasional E.vaginatum.     Lowland raised bog  In the UK lowland raised bogs are a particular feature of cool, rather humid regions such as  the north-west lowlands of England, the central and north-east lowlands of Scotland, Wales  and Northern Ireland, but remnants also occur in some southern and eastern localities, for  example Somerset, South Yorkshire and Fenland. Plant communities that are typical of  natural raised bogs include the bog pool communities M1 to M3 and M18 Erica tetralix -  Sphagnum papillosum raised and blanket mire. In addition a number of communities,  including M15 Scirpus cespitosus - Erica tetralix wet heath, M19 Calluna vulgaris -  Eriophorum vaginatum blanket mire, M20 Eriophorum vaginatum blanket and raised mire,  M25 Molinia caerulea - Potentilla erecta mire. Peatland species predominate eg.  Tricophorum, Eriophorum angustifolium, Sphagnum spp, Vaccinium oxycoccus and  Andromeda polifolia. Often in lowland areas in unimproved/unafforested areas of  flood  plains. A good indicator is the location of the bog on level ground with a gently domed  structure and an absence of calcicolous and mesotrophic wetland species. CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    77  Broad Habitat Bog  Theme: Agriculture/Natural Vegetation  Primary attribute:  Other bog (A): This broad category includes all vegetation (other than blanket bog) that is  dominated by peatland species and should be identified by the plants present and not by  topographic position since across the whole of Britain there is no consistency in the position  of bogs within the landscape.  The category therefore includes raised bogs and valley bogs but  note that the soligenous mires dominated purely by Molinia and Juncus species would be  included under moorland grass as no other peatland species are present.  Calluna may be up  to 50% cover but usually less.  Molinia and Sphagnum species are usually present, often over  25%.  Tricophorum is also often present as a significant cover species.  Other species which  may be locally dominant include Myrica gale, Eriophorum angustifolium and Nardus stricta.  Indicative species include Narthecium ossifragum, Drosera spp., and Pedicularis ssp.    Theme: Inland Physiography  Primary attribute(s):  Peat hags (A): includes any bare or eroding peat which is not vegetated and should be  qualified by a % cover attribute  Current peat workings (A): where peat has obviously been extracted in the current or  previous season - should be qualified by a % cover attribute   Old peat workings (A): and may be qualified by a % cover attribute     Physiography cover: the following cover proportions should be used in conjunction with the  primary attributes above and should relate to the percent of the area as seen from above: 95 -  100% peat, >50% peat, 10-50% peat.

BROAD HABITAT 13: RIVERS AND STREAMS    The Broad Habitat is selected at the polygon level. At the component level all attributes  should be recorded under the Inland Water theme.    Theme: Inland Water  Primary attribute(s):  Canalised river (A): rivers which have been modified (eg sections straightened, banks  smoothed), but which still follow the same basic direction as the natural watercourse.   River (A): defined as being more than 2.5m wide; a stream is less than 2.5m. (2.5 m would be  a very brave leap).     22.  BROAD HABITAT 14: STANDING OPEN WATERS AND CANALS    The Broad Habitat is selected at the polygon level. At the component level all attributes  should be recorded under the Inland Water, Agriculture/Natural vegetation and Structures  themes. Ponds occur in this BH and these will require detailed mapping in this survey.     Theme: Inland Water  Primary attribute(s):  Pond (A, P): –a body of standing water 25m2 - 2 ha in area which usually holds water for at  least 4 months of the year (this definition was used in the Lowland Pond Survey 1996 and  may be difficult to apply in a one-off visit – particular attention should be paid to the type of  vegetation associated with the feature). N.B. Ponds are a key feature of the survey in 2007,  hence the following detailed section on the identification and mapping of ponds.  Pond, sampled: pond which will be sampled in this survey  Lake - natural (A, P): any inland water body bigger than a pond, should be mapped using  this attribute.   Lake - artificial (A, P): usually distinguished by the presence of a dam or embankment.   Area of many small waterbodies   Canal (A): constructed where no watercourse existed previously.   Theme: Agriculture/Natural Vegetation  Primary attribute:  Aquatic macrophytes (A): aquatic vegetation where macrophytes persist as emergents within  standing water . Species include Typha spp., Ranunculus fluitans, Phragmites australis.     Primary Qualifier: do not record.    Vegetation type: Bryophytes, Forbs, Grasses, Monocots (other), Sedges, Trees, Woody. CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    79  Species: BRC list according to selected vegetation type.    Species Cover: This should be recorded in the following categories: <10%, 10-25%, 25-50%,  50-75%, 75-95%, 95-100%.    Theme: Structures  Primary attribute:  Gravel pit  Use:  Sporting/Recreational  Further Information on the identification and mapping of ponds  Overview   •  During mapping every pond in every square needs to be identified, and basic  attributes need to be recorded for every pond.  Data will be recorded on a paper  fieldsheet “CS2007 Pond Mapping Recording Sheet”, a copy is included at the end of  this section.  •  One pond in every square that contains ponds is then selected for a more detailed  condition assessment, which consists of a survey of plants, environmental  characteristics and water chemistry carried out by the freshwater surveyors.  This  pond is named the “survey pond” (Pond, sampled in Surveyor).    •  As part of the mapping process you need to select the survey pond based on the list of  all ponds in the square collected during mapping on the CS2007 Pond Mapping  Recording Sheet.  Full details of this process are given in the section entitled  “Selecting one pond per square for condition survey”.  •  This means the pond condition assessment cannot be carried out until all ponds in the  square have been mapped.  Identifying ponds  The pond definition to be used for CS2007 is “a body of standing water 25m2 to 2ha in area  which usually holds water for at least four months of the year”.  Note, this includes ponds below the CS Minimum Mappable Unit area, and the data recorded  for every pond includes an estimate of area for these small ponds.  In order to work out the size of a pond to see if it fits this definition you must correctly  identify the outer boundary of the pond.  This is defined as the 'upper level at which water CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    80  stands in winter', so is probably a larger area than the current water area.  The outer boundary  can be identified from one or more characteristics.  It is often best identified by a change in  the distribution of wetland plants, particularly by a rapid transition to terrestrial species, often  marked by a fringe of rushes.  Where solid features such as trees, walls or pipes occur within  the water area a “water mark” will usually be evident. In some cases, where willow trees are  present thick bundles of fine roots out of the water can indicate the depth to which the roots  have been submerged. Sometimes a break of slope is present at the winter waterline. If the  pond has an outflow this will determine the upper winter water level.  The pond definition is deliberately broad and includes temporary waterbodies which may be  dry at the time of survey.  It also includes ponds of man-made and natural origin.  It includes  a variety of water body types such as quarry pools, heathland ponds, moats, small ornamental  lakes, oxbow ponds, peat pools, pingos and dune slack pools.  In some cases it will be  difficult to identify ponds, to define their outer limits or to distinguish them from other water  body types. Some help with these is given below.  Identifying temporary ponds  Ponds which are dry at the time of survey may be difficult to identify.  The Lowland Pond  Survey carried out in summer 1996 found 41% of ponds were dry or nearly dry (based on data  from 150 Countryside Survey squares in lowland Britain).  Ponds that are dry or nearly dry at  the time of survey can be identified from the following features:  •  wetland vegetation present;  •  bare mud / deposits of soft sediment (may show poaching by stock);  •  strandline deposits;  •  a basin in which water will accumulate in winter;  •  an evident break of bank slope; and  •  water marks on trees / walls etc.  If it is evident from these signs that a currently dry area is a temporary pond that “usually  holds water for four or more months of the year” then record it as a pond.  The images below show examples of temporary ponds when they are dry and wet, note how  difficult they can be to spot when dry. CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    81            Distinguishing ponds from other standing waters - identifying ponds in fen, marsh and other  mires  In areas of fen and marsh ponds may sometimes merge into the surrounding wetlands without  an obvious boundary. In such cases it is sometimes still possible to identify a change from  wetter to damp-ground vegetation. If the boundary is still difficult to locate, use a break of  slope to define the pond and note this on the fieldsheet.  Distinguishing ponds from other standing waters - identifying ponds in bogs  In some blanket bogs it may be difficult to distinguish a pond because it is linked to many  other small interconnected pools.    Where maps from CS2000 are not available the surveyor will need to decide where the pond  boundary falls. Sometimes the decision will be fairly arbitrary. In this case it is important to  define the pond so it can be easily identified again in the next round of Countryside Survey.   It may help to use fixed features and define an area from that point (e.g. 30m x 30m area next  to the corner of a boardwalk). CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    82  Identifying boundaries of connected ponds  Where waterbodies are connected by channels the surveyor will need to decide whether they  are a single pond or multiple ponds.  Factors to consider are the maximum winter water level,  the width and depth of joining channels, and the similarity in type of the waterbodies.   Waterbodies which would only be joined during occasional flood, or which are joined by  small narrow channels should be considered as separate.  Distinguishing ditches from ponds  Where ditches contain standing water they may appear to fit the pond definition.  A ditch can  be defined as a man-made waterbody more than 20 times long than it is wide and these should  not be recorded as ponds.  Distinguishing dammed streams from ponds  Where streams are dammed they should not be included as ponds if there is flow through  them or if they are less than approximately 15 times the width of the stream.  Distinguishing flushes from ponds  Flushes tend to form on a slope and do not have a ‘basin’ form in which water will  accumulate in winter.  Pond attributes to record  If a square currently contains ponds, or if a pond is shown on mapping from the previous  round of Countryside Survey (CS2000) then the mapping surveyor will need to complete the  “CS2007 Pond Mapping Recording Sheet” see section on POND SURVEY MAPPING at the  end of this section.    23.

BROAD HABITAT 18: SUPRA-LITTORAL ROCK      Supralittoral rock occurs above high water mark, in areas influenced by wavesplash and sea- spray. Features that may be present include vertical rock, boulders,gullies, ledges and pools,  depending on the wave exposure of the site and its geology. Salt-tolerant species are the  characteristic colonisers.  Typical plants in such areas include Cochleria officinalis, Plantago  maritima, Tripleurospermum maritium, Sedum rosea, Ligusticum scoticum, Silene maritima  Armeria maritime, Crithmum maritimum, Plantago coronopus and, in some rich areas, Arctic  species such as purple saxifrage Saxifraga oppositifolia and Silene acaulis. The Broad Habitat  is selected at the polygon level. At the component level all attributes should be recorded under  the Agriculture/Natural Vegetation and Coastal features themes.  Priority Habitat  Maritime (cliffs and slopes) vegetation  This habitat type is found on sea cliffs or other coastal situations and usually herb-rich due to  salt spray. Halophytes always present eg Plantago maritima, Plantago coronopus, Armeria  maritima and Tripleurospermum maritium.  Broad Habitat Supra-littoral rock  Theme: Agriculture/Natural Vegetation  Primary attribute:  Maritime vegetation CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    88  Theme: Coastal features (coastal features should only be mapped above Mean High Water  Mark).

BROAD HABITAT 19: SUPRA-LITTORAL SEDIMENT    The Broad Habitat is selected at the polygon level. At the component level all attributes  should be recorded under the Agriculture/Natural Vegetation and Coastal features themes.    Priority Habitats  Sand dune (vegetated)   Sand dune vegetation should be recorded where the area is vegetated at 25% or greater,  otherwise the physiography attribute sandy shore (36) should be used.  Typical species  include Ammophila arenaria, Leymus arenarius, Elymus farctus, Viola tricolor, and  Euphorbia portlandica.  Dune slacks should also be included with typical species such as  Salix repens.    Strandline vegetation  Vegetation will establish on shingle beaches when there is a matrix of finer material such as CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    89  sand or silt, and where the structure is stable. Herb-rich open pioneer stages colonise the  seaward edge with species such as Crambe maritima, Lathyrus japonicus, Armeria maritima,  Glaucium flavum and Eryngium maritimum.    (Machair: is a distinctive sand dune formation that is only found in the north and west coast of  Scotland  and in western Ireland. The main habitats of machair are dry grassland, damp  grassland, marsh and standing water and the vegetation broadly described as a herb-rich  sward. Early colonisers are Ammophila arenaria, Halimione  portulacoides and Carex  arenaria, followed by Trifolium pratense  and Lotus corniculatus, which fix nitrogen making  the soil more suitable for herbs and grasses. CS surveyors should record Machair as its  component parts, they should NOT  classify to Machair as this will be done post-survey.)

BROAD HABITAT 21: LITTORAL SEDIMENT    The Broad Habitat is selected at the polygon level. At the component level all attributes  should be recorded under the Agriculture/Natural Vegetation and Coastal features themes.    Priority Habitats  Saltmarsh   This PH should only be recorded where the area is vegetated, otherwise bare mud  (Physiography section) is appropriate.  Typical species include Salicornia, Puccinellia,  Triglochin maritima and Aster tripolium. In complex situations which cannot be mapped, the  polygon should be assigned to a mosaic and proportions of ‘bare mud’ and vegetated ground  in a polygon indicated.     Mudflats    Broad habitat  Theme: Coastal features  Primary attribute:  Bare mud (A)    Priority Habitat  Theme: Agriculture/Natural Vegetation  Primary attribute:  Saltmarsh  Mudflats    Primary Qualifier: do not record.

BROAD HABITAT 22: SEA    The Broad Habitat Sea is selected at the polygon level. At the component level the primary  attribute Sea should be recorded under the Coastal features themes.  Theme: Coastal features  Primary attribute:  Sea (A): this may seem obvious but is helpful in estuarine and coastal marsh situations -  always record.       30. BROAD HABITAT: MOSAIC    If it is impossible to delimit an area of Broad and Priority Habitat because the habitats are  spatially indistinguishable or within a wider area patches are smaller than the MMU then the  polygon may be described as a mosaic. You will need to include the Broad/Priority Habitat  description at the component level and against each primary code you will be asked to assign  a percentage cover of the habitat. The percentages for these must add up to 100%.    Example  A mosaic of Bog and Dwarf Shrub Heath in an upland area would be assigned Mosaic at the  polygon level with at least two components.    Component 1  Theme: Agriculture/Natural Vegetation  Primary attribute:  Other Bog    % area:   30%    Primary Qualifier: do not record.    Vegetation type: Bryophytes, Forbs, Grasses, Monocots (other), Sedges, Trees, Woody.    Species: BRC list according to selected vegetation type.

NON-SPECIFIC PRIMARY ATTRIBUTES    All of the following can be recorded under a range of Broad/Priority Habitats;    Theme: Inland Physiography  Bare ground/disturbance/bare soil  For the following primary attributes the species composition of the field layer beneath the  scattered trees or shrubs determines the Broad/Priority Habitat.  Physiography cover: The following cover proportions should be used in conjunction with the  primary attribute above.  95 - 100% bare ground:   >50% bare ground:   10-50% bare ground:  N.B. This was not possible at the start of CS2007 so surveyors were asked to record the %  cover as rock – for want of a bare ground option.  Theme: Forestry  Scattered trees (A): 6 or more trees which do not make a wood or clump (see definitions)  because their crowns are not contributing 20% cover of the mapped unit and the trees are not  more than 50 m from other trees (in which case they are mapped as individuals).   Scattered trees – 2-5 (A, P):  2-5 trees which do not make a wood or clump (see definitions)  because their crowns are not contributing 20% cover of the mapped unit and the trees are not  more than 50 m from other trees (in which case they are mapped as individuals).   Scattered scrub (A, P): scattered as for trees.     Theme: Inland Water  Signs of drainage CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    94                                                         32.  POND SURVEY MAPPING      Pond attributes to record on Pond Mapping recording Sheet    If a square currently contains ponds, or if a pond is shown on mapping from the previous  round of Countryside Survey (CS2000) then the mapping surveyor will need to complete the  “CS2007 Pond Mapping Recording Sheet”.  One line on the sheet needs to be completed for  every pond in the square, and for ponds that were previously recorded but are no longer  present.  For every pond the following attributes need to be recorded:   i)  Pond polygon ID – this will be available from the Surveyor mapping system.  If  for any reason it is not available put the fullest Grid Reference possible.  ii)  Area of pond (maximum winter water level) in m2.  Note – this is already  recorded on the tablet PC if the pond is above the Minimum Mappable Unit  (MMU) size.  It also needs to be recorded here because it may be different from  the PC record if (i) it meets the pond definition but is below the MMU size (i.e. is  between 25 m2 and 400 m2 ), or (ii) the pond falls on the boundary of the square –  here record the entire area of the pond, not just the area within the square.  iii)  Does the pond contain water? Record Yes or No, if only wet mud is present  record No.  iv)  If the pond is shown on the CS2000 map, but is now lost give the reason for loss,  where L = land drainage, I = infilling, B = built over, O = other (list in notes), U  = unknown  v)  If the pond is not shown on the CS2000 map give the reason why, where N = the  pond is in an areas of the square that was not previously mapped, C = the pond  has been created since then, and U = the pond was not recorded for an unknown  reason – note leave this blank if this is a new Countryside Survey square so it has  not been mapped at all.  vi)  If this is a new pond (i.e. C was recorded in the previous column) then give the  reason (or reasons) for creation if any evidence can be seen: F = fishing, S =  shooting, W = wildfowl, L = wildlife, G = golf hazard, X = ornamental fish, O =  other (list in notes), U = unknown.  Record any additional notes in the notes column.  As soon as all the ponds in a square have been recorded, you should carry out the process of  identifying the survey pond and then give this fieldsheet to the freshwater surveyors so they  can carry out the condition survey. CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    95  Selecting one pond per square for condition survey  Overview  If the survey square contains one or more ponds, a single pond per square will be surveyed to  assess its condition.  This pond is referred to here as the “survey pond” (‘Pond, sampled’ in  Surveyor).  The survey pond needs to be randomly selected from the ponds available.  To help with this,  if the square has been surveyed previously for CS2000 a survey pond has been randomly pre- selected in advance. A list of preselected ponds will be available on the tablet PC called  “preselected ponds.xls”. A shortcut to preselected ponds.xls will be provided on the tablet  making its location obvious.  You will need to identify whether the pre-selected pond can be used or whether the pond  selection process to randomly chose a survey pond needs to be applied in the field.  This is  because additional ponds may be recorded in the current survey that were not in the CS2000  dataset and it is important to include these ponds in the random selection process.  You cannot  do this until all the ponds in the square have been mapped and you have the completed  CS2007 Pond Mapping Recording Sheet.  The pond selection process will need to be applied in the field if:  1. the square has not previously been mapped in CS2000,   2. mapping of the square for CS2007 has found new ponds in the square that were  not recorded in CS2000 (e.g. because they are newly created, or in an area of the  square that was not mapped in CS2007, or because they were not mapped for an  unknown reason, i.e. if anything is recorded in the shaded column in the CS2007  Pond Mapping Recording Sheet)  3. the pre-selected pond no longer exists, or  4. access to the pre-selected pond has been refused.  The decision tree below explains this process.  Method for selecting a survey pond  1. Examine the completed Pond Mapping Recording Sheet.  2. If the square only contains one pond this will be the survey pond.    3. If it contains more than one pond select the survey pond use the table of random numbers  Appendix 4 to select which pond number on the Pond Mapping Recording Sheet will be  the survey pond. CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    96  4. Cross off the number used on the table below and on the next occasion use the next  number in the row.    For example, if the square contains six ponds look in the table below at the row for six ponds  in a square.  The pond selected would be number five on the Pond Mapping Recording Sheet.   On the next occasion where there were six ponds in a square the pond numbered one on the  sheet would be selected.  For the few squares which contain more than 20 ponds pick a random number yourself before  looking at the list of ponds.  It may be that in applying this process the pond finally selected for survey is the same one that  was originally pre-selected.  This is an acceptable outcome, the reason for reapplying the  process would be to ensure that new ponds had the opportunity to be included through the  random selection process.    Decision tree for deciding whether the pre-selected survey pond can be used, or whether  the pond selection process needs to be carried out in the field.  Was the square mapped in CS2000?                        Yes                           No              Has mapping for CS2007 identified                   Carry out the pond selection process in the  new ponds not recorded in CS2000                    field  (newly created or not previously mapped)?      No                                                        Yes   Does the pre-selected pond*  still exist and is access possible?    Yes                                                   No                        Use the pre-selected survey pond      Recording the pond selected  Fill in the section at the bottom of the Pond Mapping Recording Sheet as follows. CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    97  Record whether or not the pre-selected survey pond will be used as the survey pond.  If the pre-selected survey pond cannot be used, give the reason why:  A if additional ponds have been recorded in the square i.e. if anything is recorded in the  shaded column showing reasons why ponds recorded now were not recorded in the  CS2000 dataset,  B if the pre-selected pond no longer exists, or  C if access permission has been refused.  Circle the number of the pond which will be the survey pond in the first column of the form.   Record the selected pond using the ‘Pond sampled’ primary attribute under the Inland Water  theme on either the Areas or Points tab (depending on whether the pond is an area or a point)  in the Landscape Feature Editing toolbox in Surveyor (on the tablet) to reflect the correct  pond.  The Survey pond details should also be filled in on the ‘preselected ponds.xls’ sheet on  the tablet. CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    98        Point features are individual landscape elements that occupy less than an area of 20x20m. Surveyors  will need to click on each point in the CS2007 layer and either confirm that the point accurately  represents what they see in the field, edit point attributes or delete the point accordingly. Spatial  accuracy is not a key aspect of the survey but where necessary, surveyors can also move points.  Points can also be added to indicate new features.    The task that surveyors will most commonly be carrying out in the field is checking and confirming  and /or changing and adding to the attributes assigned to each point by previous surveyors.     Checking attributes   The attributes of a point feature are all the possible descriptors for that feature. Features which will  be recorded as points on the map are listed below (POINT ATTRIBUTES). They include trees,  standing water bodies and ponds and are listed under all the available themes.     Checking and changing Point Attributes on the tablet    For all point editing tasks surveyors will need to click the Points tab in the Landscape Feature Editing  toolbox:      Having clicked on the Attributes button the surveyors will then need to zoom or pan to the location  on the map display to select a point for attribute update. Points can be selected by dragging a box  around them as an alternative to trying to click on the point. The selected point is shown highlighted  in yellow. The attribute editor will open, and details should be checked and/or changed for the point.  Fields requiring mandatory values are shown in orange, and those for which values are optional are  33.  METHODOLOGY FOR MAPPING POINT FEATURES CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    99  shown in blue.    A point may have more than one component. Components can be added, copied, or deleted, and  attributes of components can be edited. These edits are all undertaken in the Landscape Points  Attribute Editor toolbox.          Editing Point Attributes on the tablet    To add a new component, click on an existing component and click the New button in the attribute  editor summary pane on the left.  To copy a component, click on an existing component, and click the Copy button in the attribute  editor summary pane.  To delete a component, click on the component to select it, and click the Delete button.    On completing attribute edits and selecting ‘Completed’ from the visit status field at the point level  the point will change in appearance (see below) when the map screen is refreshed.          The map must be at a scale of 1:5000 or less before the surveyor can select  points for attribute update.  Points can only have their attributes updated one at a time.  Each point must contain at least one component. CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    100 100.  POINT ATTRIBUTES    Definitions of tree/shrub features (Forestry theme) to be recorded as points:     Trees/scrub should be recorded in any situation except inside the curtilages of buildings or  communication routes (e.g. roads, railways) or as individuals immediately adjacent to non- agricultural curtilages.     Individual trees should be recorded as points from all recreation land such as golf courses and playing  fields (except in urban situations). Where large numbers of individual trees are present the surveyor  should use their judgement to ensure that this is adequately reflected in the dataset without spending  inordinate amounts of time making a detailed map of each individual tree location.     Tree species (with apical dominance leading to the formation of recognised trunks) of all sizes should  be recorded, as should shrubby species (comprising scrub).  Veteran trees (maximum 2 of each  species)  should be recorded as outlined below.  Note on Buffer zones  Many landowners are being paid to ‘buffer’ the point features that you will be recording, i.e. protect  them from the management of the adjacent field. Record Yes (for buffer present)/No against  ‘buffer  zones’ for each of these features.    Theme: Forestry  Primary attribute:   Individual trees (P) If greater than 50m apart trees should be recorded as individual trees. Similarly  lines of trees of less than 20 m in length, trees standing singly in hedges and isolated coppice stools  should be recorded as individual trees. Groups of 2-5 and ≥6 trees closer than 50m to one another  should be recorded as scattered trees.   Individual scrub (P): an individual of a shrubby species or a tree in shrubby form more than 50m  from another individual.   Clump of trees (A, P): a small woodland or group of trees (6 or more) and of less than 0.25 ha.   Scattered trees 2-5 (A, P):  2-5 trees which do not make a wood or clump (see definitions) because  their crowns are not contributing 20% cover of the mapped unit and the trees are not more than 50 m  from other trees (in which case they are mapped as individuals).   Scattered scrub (A, P ): scattered as for trees  Patch of scrub (A, P): an area of continuous scrub (canopy >25%) of any size consisting exclusively  of shrubby species or trees in shrubby form, often with tree regeneration. Individual trees of more  than twice the average height of the scrub should be separately marked as individuals or scattered.   Dead standing trees (P)  Dead lying trees CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    101   Buffer zone:Yes/no    Vegetation type: (choose woody)    Species: Access to BRC list of trees and shrub species    Species proportion: Individual tree, <10%, 10-25%, 25-50% , 50-75% , 75-95% , 95-100%    Modal DBH: Modal diameter at breast height should be recorded in the following categories; <3cm,  3-20cm, 21-50cm, 50cm-75cm, <75cm (change), 75-1m, 1m-2m, >2m. (N.B. DBH should be  recorded where trunk is undamaged/not lumpy). For trees with multi-stems DBH will be measured at  the highest point below where the tree forks, even if this is very close to the ground. If this is not  possible DBH of individual stems should be recorded.     Theme: Veteran tree  In each square you are also asked to record up to 10 veteran trees (maximum 2 per species). Use the  Rule of Thumb column in Appendix 5 to decide whether a tree should be recorded as a veteran.  Record the following details for (up to) the first two veteran trees of each species which you  encounter in the square. Veteran trees can be part of a line of trees and should be marked with a point  against which the following details are recorded on the tablet.

Hence there is a detailed protocol regarding pond mapping included above.  Primary attribute:  Lake – Natural (A, P) : any inland water body bigger than a pond, should be mapped using this code  Lake – Artificial (A, P): usually distinguished by the presence of a dam or embankment  Spring (P): usually marked on the map but implies a continual supply of water at ground surface.  Well (A, L, P)  Gorge (L, P)  Waterfall  Pond (A, P): a body of standing water 25m2-2Ha in area which usually holds water for at least 4  months of the year (this is a standard definition of a pond but is obviously sometimes difficult to  apply, particular attention should be paid to the type of the vegetation associated with the feature).  Ponds are points when smaller than the minimum mappable unit of 20x20m and areas when over that  size.  Pond, Sampled: as above, but this pond has been pre-selected for detailed sampling. If the pond  mapping exercise reveals that the pre-selected pond needs re-selecting the pond attributes should be  changed using the attribute editor.  Buffer zone: Yes/no    Theme: Inland Physiography  Primary attribute:  Rock outcrop & cliff <5m (A, L, P): areas of bare rock should be included  here together with a %  cover category (12-14)   Soil erosion (A, L, P): includes both human and natural erosion in any  situation   Surface boulders (A, P): boulders are defined as >50 cms in any direction and should be mapped as  an area with a % cover attribute (12-14)     Theme: Structures  Primary attribute:  Building (A, P): usually present on the map. Gardens/Grounds apply to curtilages associated   with residential or other buildings. Gardens/Grounds may be mapped and attributed in groups if   they are all alike.

CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    105 The surveyor can select a different point to delete, and the originally selected point is no longer  selected.  Click the Delete Point button to finish the spatial edit.  The point will be deleted, and the surveyor will be returned to the Landscape Editing Points toolbox.    The map must be at a scale of 1:5000 or less before the surveyor can delete  points.  Points can only be deleted one at a time.  Points which do not have a valid Reason for Change value cannot be deleted.    Copy Point Attributes  Having clicked on the Points tab in the Landscape Feature Editing toolbox click on the Copy Attr.  Button. Zoom or pan to the location on the map display to select one or more points which will be  target points, and have attributes of another point copied to them.  Select points by clicking on each point or dragging a selection box over them. The selected target  points are shown highlighted in yellow.  Now select a point which will be used as the source point to copy attributes from. The selected source  point will be highlighted in blue.  The surveyor can change the source point chosen by selecting another source point.  Click Copy Attributes. The attributes of the source point will be copied to the target points.  The  attribute editor will open, and details should be checked for each point. On completing attribute edits  and selecting ‘Completed’ from the visit status field at the polygon level the point will change in  appearance (see below) when the map screen is refreshed.    The map must be at a scale of 1:5000 or less before the surveyor can select  points to copy attributes.  There can only be one source point, there can be many target points.  Attributes copied to target points overwrite all currently held attributes at  both point and component level.          Linear features are landscape elements less than 5m wide that form lines in the landscape. CS reports  on the length and condition (and changes in these over time) of a range of linear features including  woody linear features, walls, fences and other linear features outlined below. Linear features have a  minimum length of 20m and may include gaps of up to 20m.  40.  METHODOLOGY FOR MAPPING LINEAR FEATURES CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    106   Background  All linear features (minimum length 20m, maximum width 5m) should be recorded unless they form  part of a curtilage or they are within the woodland canopy. However, linear features running along  the edge of woodlands must be recorded. Linear features which form part of curtilage, (i.e. land  intimately associated with buildings) at the boundary of urban and rural land should not be recorded.  N.B. Some features which should have been represented as areas were consistently coded by some  surveyors as lines in CS2000. Canals, canalised rivers and rivers should all appear as areas in the  dataset. Surveyors are asked to correct any instances where these features appear as lines in the  dataset.    Linear features on the GIS system will appear as continuous lines. Each continuous line represents a  linear feature which may consist of a number of different parts named ‘events’ on Surveyor. These  events may be either additive, e.g. a linear with both a fence and a woody linear feature running  along its whole length, or replacements e.g. a field boundary in which the woody linear feature is  replaced by fence where it is gappy.      Where the linear features (although individually each less than 5m wide) take up an area larger than  the minimum mappable unit a polygon should be created and assigned the BH ‘Boundary and Linear  features’ described as a wide linear feature (see BH 3 Boundaries and Linear features) . Each linear  feature should continue to be collectively represented by a single line with multiple events e.g. two  woody linear features (one a line of trees, the other a managed hedge), earth bank, ditch and fence.  (This is to avoid the necessity of trying to accurately draw each component and assess its area).       Recording Events  Within the GIS system the different events on the linear features already mapped in the square will be  defined (as below) and their extent given e.g. Fence, 30-70m, which describes the event as a fence  between 30 and 70m along the length of the line along which it is mapped. Surveyors should be  conservative about altering events on linear features and only alter where the data is seriously  inaccurate. Any alterations to the linear features or events should be made using the Surveyor system  to create a new line, cut a line, delete a line, modify the shape of a line, reshape a line, reshape a line  to follow another feature and edit the attributes of the events along the linear feature. New lines  should be drawn on the tablet as accurately as possible, using existing features for reference, as well  as making full use of range finders, measuring tapes and compasses to position and measure them.  Where there is a step change in the events along a linear feature they should be coded and recorded as  different events with their own set of attributes e.g. where a management of a WLF changes along its  length resulting in a difference in height or where a section of hedge has a totally different species  composition. CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    107 Checking event attributes   The attributes of an event are all the possible descriptors for that event. Features which will be  recorded as events on the map are listed below (EVENT ATTRIBUTES). They include fences, walls,  woody linear features etc and are listed under all the available themes.     41.  Checking and changing Event Attributes on the tablet    For all Event editing tasks surveyors will need to click the Lines tab in the Landscape Feature Editing  Toolbox.                                          Having clicked on the Attributes button the surveyors will then need to zoom or pan to the location  on the map display to select a line for event attribute update. Lines can be selected by dragging a box  across them as an alternative to trying to click on the line. The selected line is shown highlighted in  red. The attribute editor will open, and details should be checked and/or changed for the linear  feature. At the line level (top folder), only line length can be altered (see below). Event folders  (which sit underneath the top folder) in the summary pane of the Attribute Editor are shown in red  when they contain fields for which input is mandatory and in green when no input is required. Fields  requiring mandatory values are shown in orange, and those for which values are optional are shown  in blue. CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    108   Line with a single Event - Attribute Editing  42.  Editing Event Attributes on the tablet  To add a new event, click on an existing event and click the New button in the attribute editor  summary pane on the left.  To copy an event, click on an existing event, and click the Copy button in the attribute editor  summary pane.  To delete an event, click on the event to select it, and click the Delete button.    Event length can be set using the keyboard with the cursor in the Event From or Event To fields in  the Attribute Editor, or the increment/decrement buttons which are at the right hand end of these  fields. Finally the length of an Event can be set on the map display, as follows:                                                               Click the Set button which is accessed through the Attribute Editor, and is positioned immediately to  the right of the Event From and Event To boxes. To position the ‘Event From’ point, click on that  row in the Attribute Editor, select one end of the line (the number in the field will indicate whether  you are at the Event From or the Event To end of the line). Moving the pen along the line will allow  you to set the new starting point. Similarly to set the Event To point, click on that row in the   Attribute Editor, select the To point along the line, and click. As the cursor is drawn along the line,  the event length, which is highlighted in yellow, is shown following along the line.                  Event from and to points being set on map display CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    109                                                                                                                                                               On completing attribute edits the line will change in appearance based on the Theme Type when the  map screen is refreshed.    The map must be at a scale of 1:5000 or less before the surveyor can select  lines for event attribute update.  Lines can only have their event attributes updated one at a time.  Each line must contain at least one event.  Events must be a minimum of 5.0m long.      43.  Copy Events    Zoom or pan to the location on the map display to select one or more lines which will be target lines,  and have events from another line copied to them.   Click on the Copy Attr. Button and select target lines by clicking on each line or dragging a selection  box over them. The selected target lines are shown highlighted in red.  Now having clicked on the ‘i’ button, select a line which will be used as the source line to copy  events from. The selected source line will be highlighted with a thick blue line.  The surveyor can change the source line chosen by selecting another source line.  Click Copy Attributes.  The attributes of the source line will be copied to the target lines.  The attribute editor will open, and  details should be checked for each line.   On completing copy line attribute edits, the target lines will have the same appearance as the source  line when the map screen is refreshed. CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    110       Copy events showing source (left) and target (right) lines    The map must be at a scale of 1:5000 or less before the surveyor can select  lines to copy attributes.  There can only be one source line, there can be many target lines.  Events copied to target lines are added to events already attributed to target  lines.      44.  LINEAR FEATURES - EVENT ATTRIBUTES    The following lists linear events and their available attributes alphabetically under the themes in  which they occur.    Note on Margins  The margins will be additional to the cross compliance margin (N.B. not required in Wales), which is  a 2m margin measured from the centre of the hedge that all landowners receiving the Single Farm  Payment are required to retain at the edges of fields. Margin types are described in the Mapping areas  section. The most popular margin options are likely to be 6m in width and these may be additive, i.e.  one type of 6m margin immediately adjacent to another type.

Introduction to woody linear features                                                                                                                              In most landscapes the linear features that are most important for biodiversity are the woody linear  features. The term ‘woody linear features’ (WLFs) has been coined to account for the tremendous  diversity of WLFs to be found in the countryside including everything from a traditionally managed  hedge to a planted avenue of trees or a line of old scrub which may at one time have been a managed  hedge. WLFs (as defined using CS methodology) fall into two broad categories based on the extent to  which the trees within them take their natural shape.   •  ‘Natural shape’ means unhindered/unmanaged growth for at least a decade. Where  trees take their natural shape the feature will essentially be a line of trees or scrub.  •  Where trees/scrub has been managed relatively recently the WLF will fall into the  hedge category.   When coding a WLF, surveyors will be asked to decide primarily whether trees take their natural  shape and will then provide relevant information (as below) against each of these feature types in  order to enable us to group and assess the data appropriately.    Recording Woody Linear Features  Where gaps of 20m or over exist in these features they should be mapped either in individual sections  of minimum length 20m (including gaps <20m) or as individual trees/scrub, as appropriate.  Where  woody linear features are greater than 5m wide at their base or more than one tree wide they should  be mapped as a belt of trees or scrub (as appropriate).  There is a field for belts of trees >5m in width.     When coding a WLF attributes will be recorded in the following fields alongside the length and  position of the feature as represented by the line drawn in the GIS data (field as it appears in  Surveyor is recorded in brackets):  The primary question for surveyors mapping Woody Linear Features is then:  Excellent condition  Sound with minor defects  Major signs of advancing or potential deterioration  In early stages of dereliction  Derelict  Remnants CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    115  ‘Do individual trees within the feature take their natural shape?’  Yes (WLF natural shape), No  (WLF unnatural shape).

Other Line Editing tasks on the tablet  For all Event editing tasks surveyors will need to click the Lines tab in the Landscape Feature Editing  Toolbox.    48.  Create New Line    Zoom or pan to the location on the map display where the new line is to be added. Click New and use  the pen to click on the map display to create a new line. Double click to finish the edit sketch. The  new line is shown highlighted in pink. Should the shape of the line need to be refined, use the vertex  edit button to highlight the vertices and the pen to move them to the desired positions.  Click the Create Line button to finish the spatial edit.  The new line is created, and contains a single Unsurveyed/Missing Data event. In order to record an  event on the linear feature, attribute editing protocols need to be followed as described above.    The map must be at a scale of 1:5000 or less before the surveyor can edit  lines.  Lines cannot be added outside the survey square.  Lines can only be added one at a time.  Lines must be 5.0m long minimum.  A line cannot cross over itself.  When a line crosses another line, all of the lines are automatically split at the  intersection point.   Every new line is created with a single Unsurveyed/Missing Data event which  runs over the entire length of the line.               49.  Modify Line    Zoom or pan to the location on the map display where the line is to be modified. Click on or drag a  selection box over the line, which is to be modified.   The selected line is shown highlighted in pink, and vertices which can be used to edit the shape of the CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    120 line are shown along its length. Using the pen the sketch can now be modified, with vertices added  (by holding the pen along the line and right clicking until a menu appears with Insert Vertex as an  option), deleted (by selecting a vertex, right clicking and selecting Delete Vertex on the menu), and  moved (by clicking on a Vertex until the symbol changes and dragging to a new location), until the  surveyor is satisfied that the line reflects how the feature looks in the field.  Note that vertices at the end of shared boundaries cannot be edited at this point, since they are shared  nodes – they share their topology with other features, and can only be modified in Shared Node  Modify.      Line selected for Modify edit    Click to one side of the sketch to complete the modify, and view how the line will be changed as a  result of the edit.  Click Save Changes to save the spatial edit and return to the Landscape Editing – Lines toolbox.    50.  Shared Nodes – These can only be modified if selected individually as a node, click modify in  the lines editing toolbox.  Using the pen, select a shared node to modify by clicking carefully on the intersection between two  or more lines (or use the keyboard shortcut of n to prevent the selection of a boundary rather than the  node). Be patient, it can be difficult to select a node but when you manage it the node is shown  highlighted as a pink spot. CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    121   Shared node (marked with a pink cross) which has been modified – ready to save changes    Drag the node to its new position, the adjoining lines will move along with the node as it is moved.  Click to one side of the sketch to complete the modify, and see how the edited lines will be changed  as a result of the edit.  Click Save Changes to save the spatial edit and return to the Landscape Editing – Lines toolbox.    If a modify edit would result in a line, or an event which is less than the  minimum linear feature length, the edit will not be permitted.  If the points at the end of a line are shared with another line, these can only  be edited using shared node modify.  When using shared node modify the edit cannot cause any revised lines to  intersect any other revised line.  When using shared node modify the edit cannot cause any revised lines to  intersect any other linear feature.    51.  Cut Line    Zoom or pan to the location on the map display where the line is to be cut. Click or drag a selection  box to select the line to be cut. The selected line is shown highlighted in red. Using the sketch tool  (polygon with a + sign) digitise the cut polygon along the line. The length which will be cut from the  line is shown highlighted as a pink/white chain dotted line, and the length which will remain is shown  in red. CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    122   Line with cut polygon over a section – ready to cut    Click the Cut button to complete the spatial edit and return to the Landscape Editing – Lines toolbox.     52.  Modifying the Edit Sketch  If the polygon created to cut a line is not satisfactory in terms of shape, then it can be modified by  moving its vertices to create the final shape.  Click on the vertex edit button (polygon with vertices), the line now has vertices which can be used  to modify the line by adding/deleting (using the right click) or moving until the surveyor is satisfied  that the edit sketch will produce the cut required. CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    123   Edit sketch with vertices shown – ready to modify    Once the surveyor is satisfied that the edit will produce the required line click the Cut button to  complete the spatial edit and return to the Landscape Editing – Lines toolbox.    53.  Using the Copy Tool    Existing polygons from other map layers, for example OS Mastermap, can be used to make a Cut  Line edit sketch polygon, e.g. if a linear feature has been eliminated from a field (represented by a  polygon) this tool can be used to cut it accurately.  Zoom or pan to the location on the map display where the line is to be cut. Click or drag a selection  box to select the line to be cut. The selected line is shown highlighted in red.   Click the Copy button in the Inventory Editing – Lines toolbox to open the Copy features toolbox.  Select the layer you wish to copy features from (Landscape Areas) and select the feature you wish to  copy.  The selected feature is shown with a heavy blue outline. Click the Copy+ button to include this  feature in the edit sketch, the polygon is now shown with a heavy green outline, to indicate that it is  part of the Cut edit sketch. Select other features in the same way, clicking Copy+ to add more  features to the edit sketch, and Copy- to remove features from the edit sketch.  The edit sketch can be further refined using the edit vertex tool, as described above in Modifying the  Edit Sketch.  The length which will be cut from the line is shown highlighted as a pink/white chain dotted line, and  the length which will remain is shown in red. CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    124       Edit sketch made by using the Copy Features tool    Click the Cut button to complete the spatial edit and return to the Landscape Editing – Lines toolbox.    More than one line can be cut with a cut edit.  Lines can be cut in more than one place – user is given feedback if more than  one linear feature will result of the edit.  If a cut edit would result in a line, or an event which is less than the minimum  linear feature length, the edit will not be permitted.  A line cannot be deleted by a cut edit.    54.  Delete Line    Zoom or pan to the location on the map display where the line is to be deleted. Click Delete and  select the line to be deleted by clicking on it, or dragging a selection box over it. The selected line is CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    125 shown highlighted in red, provided all events attached to the line have a valid Reason for Change  value – if not, then the line attributes must be edited prior to the delete edit, and the selected line will  be highlighted as a red/white chain dotted line.       Line selected for delete with no reason for change set on an event    The surveyor can select a different line to delete, and the originally selected line is no longer selected.  Click the Delete Line button to finish the spatial edit.  The line, and all events associated with that line, will be deleted, and the surveyor will be returned to  the Landscape Editing Lines toolbox.    The map must be at a scale of 1:5000 or less before the surveyor can delete  lines.  Lines can only be deleted one at a time.  Lines which have an event which does not have a valid Reason for Change  value cannot be deleted.    55.  Reshape Line 1 – following a digitised line    Having clicked on the Reshape button zoom or pan to the location on the map display where the line  is to be reshaped. Click on or drag a selection box over the line, which is to be reshaped. The selected  line is highlighted in red.  Click the reshape line button (zig-zag with +) and use the pen to draw a reshape line along the  selected line, intersecting the line at the beginning and end of the edit. Double click to complete the  reshape line edit sketch. CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    126   Reshape edit sketch along existing line    The reshape line is shown in red, the part of the line which will be deleted is shown as usual, and  unaffected parts of the line are shown in red.  The surveyor can edit the reshape line by using the pen having clicked on the vertex edit button.  Click the Reshape button to complete the spatial edit.  The reshape edit is saved, and the surveyor is returned to the Landscape Editing – Lines toolbox.      Completed reshape on a line CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    127 The map must be at a scale of 1:5000 or less before the surveyor can reshape  a line.  If a reshape edit would result in a line, or an event which is less than the  minimum linear feature length, the edit will not be permitted.    56.  Reshape Line 2 – Following a copied line  Zoom or pan to the location on the map display where the line is to be reshaped. Click on or drag a  selection box over the line which is to be reshaped. The selected line is highlighted in red.     Line selected for reshape follow line shown in red    Use the pen to draw a reshape graphic along the selected line, intersecting the line at the beginning  and end of the edit. The reshape graphic must intersect the line to be reshaped, and any line or  polygon boundary which is to be utilised for the reshape follow copied line operation. Use the Copy  tool to select the feature required to use in the follow line edit. CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    128   Reshape using landscape area boundary copied feature    The edit sketch graphic line is shown in pink – this defines the start and end points of the reshape.   The original line remains unchanged. The line to be followed by the edit is shown in red – hence the  red line previews the result of the edit.  The reshape graphic can be modified if need be, using the vertex edit button and the pen.  Click the Reshape button to complete the spatial edit.  The original line has been moved, to follow the landscape area boundary as shown below.      Completed reshape following copied line edit CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    129 The map must be at a scale of 1:5000 or less before the surveyor can reshape  a line.  If a reshape edit would result in a line, or an event which is less than the  minimum linear feature length, the edit will not be permitted.    57.  Checking Visit status on linear features  Unfortunately the process for checking visit status on linear features is not as straightforward as it is  for either points or areas. In order to check which linear features within a square have not been  visited surveyors will need to click on the Select By Attributes field as shown below.        In the Select by Attributes Toolbar the surveyor will then need to click in the Layer field and select  Landscape Events from the dropdown menu, then scroll to VISIT_STATUS and double click  following which the VISIT_STATUS field will appear in the bottom window. The surveyor will then  need to click on ‘=’ on the buttons above, followed by ‘0’ on the tablet keyboard (available at the  bottom left of the screen). On clicking the ‘Apply’ button enabled at the bottom of the screen,  unvisited lines will appear highlighted blue. See screen shot below. CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    130 Note on LOOP features    A loop feature looks like this:        There are 85 loops in the data (see Appendix 6 – additionally surveyors will be alerted to these loops  when they download data from squares which have them). The event data for these loops is  corrupted. Therefore surveyors need to adopt the following procedure in order to edit these loops.  Change the theme on each of the events to Deleted Feature, Reason for Change: No Change, Visit  Status: Completed. Once this has been done click on ok and save and then follow the delete line  protocol above to delete each of the four lines. Surveyors then need to reinstate the feature as it is in  the field by adding a line and the attributes of the events along it (both protocols are described  above).     . CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0    1  Appendix 1: Using old Field Assessment Booklets (FAB’s)      Surveyors will be provided with electronic copies of the FAB’s which it will be possible to  look at if there are particular issues with a habitat, e.g. it is difficult to determine what type of  change has occurred.                           The old Fieldhandbook for CS2000 is also available electronically for reference on the tablet  if you require more detail than is presented here for interpretation.    CS2000    Features were mapped in six themes in CS2000, Agriculture/Natural vegetation,  Physiography, Buildings/Structures, Forestry, Boundaries and BH (only unenclosed BHs i.e.  Acid grassland, Calcareous grassland, Bog, Fen, marsh,swamp, Heath,  inland rock were  mapped) and each theme had its own paper map. On this map each feature whether it was a  line of trees or an area of habitat was given a unique identifying number within that theme  and labelled with this number.    Information for each mapping theme was recorded on a separate Data recording form.   Each Data recording form contains attribute data.  The unique number (parcel number)  from the mapping sheet is in the first column of the data recording form. The other columns  are used to record attributes which are very similar to those used in CS2007 (there have been  some additions and losses) such as primary attribute, species information  but instead of  being described in words a code number was assigned to each attribute. The code list for  CS2000 is included in this handbook as Appendix 2.

When a feature had changed the surveyor was required to place a cross against the old  attribute data and to input the new data. It was important that surveyors indicated what type  of change had taken place i.e. 701 Genuine change or 702 mis-recording in 1990, this value  was placed  in the universal code column on the data sheet to indicate whether there had been  real or genuine change.

Mapping was done de Novo (from a blank sheet of paper) so there was no requirement to  determine whether there had been change since the last survey. The map and the attributes  were recorded on the same sheet of paper and it was a simpler system than used in 2000.

SurveyDate: Date the fish survey was carried out (dd/mm/yyyy)
Supporting documentation for bird ringing data The dataset was collected in Wytham woods, Oxfordshire, UK during 2020 and 2021, as part of a long-term population monitoring project on the breeding biology and behaviour of birds. During April - June, all unringed breeding pairs were trapped at the nest and fitted with a British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) metal leg ring. Great tits and blue tits were additionally fitted with a plastic leg ring containing a RFID tag (, i.e. PIT tag, IB Technologies, UK). All nestlings were also fitted with these tags at 2 weeks old. Additional ringing was carried out throughout the autumn and winter across the woodland. Birds were trapped using mistnets; biometrics (mass, wing length, tarsus length, fats score, bill length) were recorded for all birds and immigrants to the population were fitted with tags. All birds were released after they were processed. These data were entered into our internal Edward Grey Institute (EGI) Bird data Management Project application (EBMP), where they underwent a number of quality checks (e.g. by identifying erroneous entries of nestbox identities etc.). The data were collected and entered into EBMP mainly by Keith McMahon and Sam Crofts, and by some additional field workers.  Details of data structure: The dataset comprises one csv file entitled ‘Ringing_data’ and contains 23 columns. More detailed information on columns in the csv.file: Record.type=physical=if the bird was physically held in hands, diurnal=if bird was identified without capturing it; Retrap=new capture or retrapped bird; Bto.ring=BTO Ring number, Pit.tag=alphanumerical PIT-tag or ‘ ‘’ ‘ if no Pit.tag; Pit.tag.state=0 (no PIT-tag), 1(new PIT-tag), 2(tag present but not scanned), 3(tag present and scanned), 4(tag replaced), 5(tag removed and not replaced), 6(faulty tag removed and replaced); Bto.species.code=the species caught, see here for abbreviations: https://www.bto.org/sites/default/files/u10/downloads/taking-part/species_codes.pdf ; Age=Age of the bird caught (for age codes, see: https://www.bto.org/sites/default/files/u17/downloads/about/resources/agecodes.pdf); Sex=NA=not known, F=Female, M=Male; Sexing method=pl=based on plumage characteristics, bp=brood patch, cp=cloacal protuberance, ib= inferred from previous ringing data, ip=inferred from sex of partner; Date.time=Date and time; Location=Location of capture (e.g. 20201B100 refers to the nestbox B100 in the year 2020, other locations 1B etc. describe other locations within the woods); Wing.length=wing length in mm, Weight=weight in g; Bill.length.method= s=skull, f=feathers, n=nostril; Bill.length=bill length in mm; Bill.depth.method= d=deepest point, f=feathers; Bill.depth=bill depth in mm; Tarsus.length.method= M=max or S=min; Tarsus.length=tarsus length in mm; Pox= NA=not checked, FALSE=no pox, TRUE=pox; Leg.condition.description=Any injuries on legs; Tick.description=number and location of ticks; Comments=any additional comments.
Contextual metadata for diet of common guillemot and razorbill at East Caithness, Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast and Isle of May in 2017   The dataset: This dataset contains prey items of common guillemot Uria aalge and razorbill Alca torda observed during the 2017 breeding season at East Caithness Special Protection Area (SPA; 58°12´42”N, 03°27´53”W), Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast SPA (57°23´07”N, 01°52´09”W) and Isle of May National Nature Reserve (56°10´57”N, 02°33´17”W), off the east coast of Scotland.  Diet of these two species has been studied on the Isle of May since the 1980s (Harris & Wanless 1985, 1986; Wilson et al 2004; Daunt et al. 2008; Thaxter et al 2013).  To our knowledge, only one previous study of diet has been undertaken at Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast SPA (in 2006, 6km to the north of the site used in this study; Anderson et al. 2014), and no previous study of diet has been undertaken at East Caithness SPA.  Background: Seabird studies on the Isle of May NNR were begun by Mike Harris (CEH) in 1973 as part of the Isle of May Long-Term Study (IMLOTS), which is a Key Site in the UK Joint Nature Conservation Committee’s (JNCC) national Seabird Monitoring Programme.  The methods for calculating diet are included in the Species Account in this document and have been consistent since all seabird monitoring was standardised from 1987.  The purpose of this manual is to provide standard, repeatable methods and protocols to be employed in the assessment of the diet of common guillemot and razorbill.   Field measurements: The basic approach to assessing common guillemot and razorbill diet is observing prey carried in the bills of breeding adults returning to the colony to feed the young or, in the case of common guillemot only, to display to other adults.  All fieldwork, sampling and data handling was carried out by experienced and trained staff to defined protocols agreed to meet the objectives of the work. All data were collected in the field in notebooks and field data sheets.  These were transcribed to spreadsheets after each check was made and files backed up on CEH servers. All notebooks and field sheets are archived at CEH Edinburgh.  Databases: The databases used were all quality controlled at source.    Output: The integrity of results, the quality of reports, the relationship to contracted deliverables and the punctuality of reporting are all subject to management vetting and tracking within CEH, through the Heads of Science Areas, Directors and the Finance Administration. Additionally, all staff at CEH are encouraged to publish non-confidential scientific information in the peer reviewed scientific literature, with the prior approval of the customer and customer acknowledgement.  Species accounts  Common guillemot Uria aalge  The methods for quantifying diet have been consistent since all seabird monitoring was standardised from 1987 (Harris & Wanless 1985; Wilson et al 2004; Daunt et al. 2008; Thaxter et al 2013). During chick-rearing, adults return to the colony with a single prey item in the bill which is fed to the chick.  Prey may also be brought back to the colony to display to other adults (‘display’ fish). Therefore, data on prey composition can be collected from visual observations from an observation position.   At East Caithness and Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast, two hour watches covering the period of 04:00 – 22:00 were undertaken from 13/6-1/7/17 and 19/6-5/7/17 respectively, at plots containing active breeding sites (58°12´42”N, 03°27´53”W and 57°23´07”N, 01°52´09”W repectively).  On the Isle of May (56°10´57”N, 02°33´17”W), dawn to dusk watches were carried out on 21/6/17 and 25/6/17. At all colonies, further observations were made opportunistically (range of dates the same as above for East Caithness and Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast; range of dates for Isle of May 2/4-16/7/17).   During observation watches, time of arrival, prey species and prey size were recorded.  For opportunistic observations, only the latter two were recorded.  In all years, the vast majority of prey are lesser sandeel or clupeids.  Clupeids comprise sprat and herring, which are all but impossible to separate in the field. In the current and previous years on the Isle of May, a small proportion of fish belonging to either one of these two species have been collected from breeding ledges and identified as sprat, based on small size and timing in relation to known spawning period. However, all prey from this fish family are classed as clupeids in the data set.   Prey were assigned to one of five size classes (very small, small, medium, large, very large) using the bill length of the adult as a guide.  When feeding a prey item to the chick the adult partly spreads its wings and arches its back, sometimes obscuring the view of the prey.  All prey items presented in this way were presumed to have been eaten although classification by size and/or species was not always possible.  Fish found on breeding ledges allowed an estimate of the lengths of fish in each size category.  Too few gadoids were collected to allow accurate assessment of the sizes of observed fish to be made, but gadoids made up a very small part of the diet at all three colonies.   Razorbill Alca torda  The methods for quantifying diet have been consistent since all seabird monitoring was standardised from 1987 (Harris & Wanless 1986; Daunt et al. 2008; Thaxter et al 2013). During chick-rearing, adults of this species return to the colony with multiple fish in the bill which is fed to the chick.  Therefore, data on prey composition can be collected from visual observations from an observation position. At East Caithness and Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast, two hour watches covering the period of 04:00 – 22:00 were undertaken from 16/6-1/7/17 and 20/6-5/7/17 respectively, at plots containing active breeding sites (58°12´42”N, 03°27´53”W and 57°23´07”N, 01°52´09”W repectively).  On the Isle of May (56°10´57”N, 02°33´17”W), dawn to dusk watches were carried out on 21/6/17 and 25/6/17. At all colonies, further observations were made opportunistically (range of dates the same as above for East Caithness and Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast; range of dates for Isle of May 3/6-14/7/17).   During observation watches, time of arrival, prey species, prey size and prey number were recorded.  For opportunistic observations, only the latter two were recorded.  In all years, the vast majority of prey are lesser sandeel or clupeids.  Clupeids comprise sprat and herring, which are all but impossible to separate in the field. In the current and previous years on the Isle of May, a small proportion of fish belonging to either one of these two species have been collected from guillemot breeding ledges and identified as sprat, based on small size and timing in relation to known spawning period. However, all prey from this fish family are classed as clupeids in the data set.   Prey were assigned to one of five size classes (very small, small, medium, large, very large) using the bill length of the adult as a guide.  When feeding a fish to the chick the adult partly spreads its wings and arches its back, sometimes obscuring the view of the prey.  All prey items presented in this way are presumed to have been eaten although classification by size and/or species is not always possible.  Fish found on guillemot breeding ledges allowed an estimate of the lengths of fish in each size category.  Too few gadoids were collected to allow accurate assessment of the sizes of observed fish to be made, but gadoids made up a very small part of the diet at all three colonies. The number of prey is recorded either as an exact estimate or as a broad category (“few”; “many”).  Broader categories are necessary since estimating the number of prey in the bill is challenging.

Supporting information for NE/W002930/1: Building, infrastructure, and river channel reaches in Chamoli district, India, following the ice-debris flow, February 2021  Data description  What are these data?  These data are GIS shapefiles which contain geospatial information describing the location and condition of bridges, buildings and roads in Chamoli District, Uttarakhand, India, following the 7th February 2021 avalanche and debris flow hazard cascade (the so-called ‘Chamoli event’). The dataset also contains a GIS shapefile which contains polygon outlines supporting geomorphological analysis of change in river valleys between the avalanche source and the town of Joshimath.  Why were the data collected?  The data were created to support the objectives of NERC Urgency Grant NE/W002930/1, specifically post-event reconnaissance including the identification of riparian infrastructure that was directly or indirectly affected by the 2021 flood.  Where were the data collected?  The data were derived from manual interpretation of high-resolution satellite imagery covering a portion of Chamoli District, Uttarakhand, India. The data span an area approximately described by the following rectangular bounding box (WGS 84 / UTM Zone 44 co-ordinate system):  Top left: 353406 m E, 3385683 m N Lower right: 381352 m E, 3371602 m N  When were the data collected?  The data were created between 29 June 2021 and 21 August 2021. The underpinning satellite imagery supporting the mapping of buildings and riparian infrastructure was acquired between 28 April 2019 and 10 February 2021.  How were the data collected?  The data were created by manual digitisation of GIS shapefiles (polygons and polylines) in ArcGIS Pro software (version 2.8). Existing satellite imagery were used as the reference data. Satellite imagery supporting building and infrastructure mapping was obtained by commercial satellite imagery vendor Maxar from their WorldView-3 Earth observation satellite under the terms of an agreement with a project partner as part of NASA High-Mountain Asia Grant 80NSSC20K1595. Data licencing terms prohibit sharing of these data in the public domain. We additionally used new Pléiades DEMs to support the creation of the geomorphological segment shapefiles. These data appear within this data collection.   Who was responsible for the collection and interpretation of the data?  A Research Assistant employed on the project created the building and infrastructure shapefile footprints, with guidance from the Principal Investigator and a Co-Investigator. These individuals were primarily responsible for interpreting the data. The geomorphological ‘segments’ were created by the Principal Investigator.  Completeness of the dataset  The building and infrastructure mapping dataset is complete in the sense that it is the most comprehensive dataset of riparian buildings and infrastructure that we were able to generate using the resource available to us. There may be minor omissions (i.e. features that were not mapped).  When digitising geomorphological segment outlines, we manually excluded areas of the channel and valley floor which were in heavy shadow, and which tended to coincide with satellite DEM artifacts (contained within this data collection).  Experimental design and analytical methods  A summary of the overarching data creation strategy is given in section 1.5. To expand on this, mapping focused on creation of individual shapefiles describing the location of bridges, buildings and roads, and geomorphological segments. Contained in the former is attribute information describing the ‘type’ and ‘condition’ of these assets using the schema below (and included in the ‘key.txt’ file):  Roads: 	Type: 	1 - Major (paved) 	2 - Major (unpaved) 	3 - Minor (paved) 	4 - Minor (unpaved) 	5 - Track (unpaved)  	Condition: 	1 - Intact  	2 - Obstructed/damaged  Bridges: 	Type: 	0 – Intact bridge (‘former bridges’ shapefile does not have this attribute)  	Condition: 	1 – Intact 	2 – Damaged (no bridges sit in their category) 	3 – Destroyed		  Buildings:  	Type: 	1 - Residential (permanent) 	2 - Residential (informal/temporary) 	3 - Industrial i.e. hydropower 	4 - Municipal  	Condition: 	1 - Intact  	2 - Obstructed/damaged  The geomorphological segments shapefile contains attribute data in the form of an ID (ranging from 1-35) and an accompanying area (in m2). Other fields can be disregarded.   Collection / generation / transformation methods  Methods of data generation are described above.  Nature and units of recorded values  Data were created in the WGS 84 / Universal Transverse Mercator (Zone 44N) co-ordinate system (EPSG:32644). Values contained in shapefile attribute tables are described in section 2 (this document).  Quality control  Quality control comprised review of the mapped data by project Co-Investigators Westoby and Dunning, who undertook independent visual review and confirmed that the data were of sufficient accuracy and quality to support the wider disaster response objectives of the project.  Dataset structure  This dataset comprises a total of 46 files. We list the primary shapefiles (.shp) below. Each .shp file in the ‘infrastructure_mapping’ directory is accompanied by a .dbf, .cpg, .sbn, .sbx and .prj file of the same name. A key for interpreting the attribute tables of those shapefiles is provided as ‘key.txt’.  Folder: Bridges Files: 10Feb2021_bridge.shp former_bridges.shp  Folder: Buildings Files: 10Feb2021_build.shp  Folder: Roads Files: 10Feb2021_road.shp former_roads.shp  The folder ‘geomorphological_segments’ contains the following .shp file, plus identically named files with the extensions .cpg, .dbf, .prj and .shx.

The first of these is essential in order to update land use databases and to ensure that the outputs from the other activities are both current and relevant.  ITE has carried out two major surveys of GB to sample data from the natural environment; both were based on the application of the ITE Land Classification System. The first was in 1977/8 with an emphasis on recording ecological data, especially vegetation and soils. The second was in 1984 and concentrated on the mapping of land cover and landscape features. A sample unit of 1 x 1 km square has been used. In 1978, eight squares were drawn from each of 32 land classes giving a total of 256 sites; this was increased by 50% in 1984 so that 12 squares were visited in each class (384 sites in total).  Data collected from these two surveys have been used to characterise the land classes, leading to a better understanding of the classification and to its wider use as a stratification for ecological sampling. A comparison of the land cover and landscape data from the two surveys has allowed quantitative assessments of recent changes in the countryside. The survey data have also been used in a series of contract projects, forming a basis for modelling the rural environment.  In 1988, a reduced sample of km squares was visited and further vegetation data were collected. These data, together with those from the previous surveys, have been central to ITE’s project for the DOE on "The Ecological Consequences of Land Use Change" (ECOLUC).  Analysis of land cover and landscape data from 1978 and 1984, together with preliminary results from the 1988 survey, suggest that changes are continuing to take place in the countryside. This is confirmed by the results of other studies, notably that completed by Hunting Technical Surveys on behalf of DOE/CC. It is important to provide current datasets for scientific evaluation of ecological systems in the countryside, and to monitor the changes that are taking place to identify current trends and processes. ITE is committed to monitoring changes in the rural environment and 1990 has long been seen as an appropriate date for resurvey.  ITE will conduct a further sample survey in 1990 to collect land cover, landscape and vegetation data from sites visited in previous years. This project will adopt the approach used in previous ITE surveys, but will be enhanced by the inclusion of additional research activities, information capture at a greater level of detail, and increased research collaboration and liaison. The sample number will be increased by 128 additional sites to 512. In particular, the project will contribute to the capture of land use data using satellite imagery and a land cover map of Britain will be constructed. This will be particularly valuable in linking the ‘top-down’ remote sensing approach with the ‘bottom-up’ field survey, through the ITE Land Classification System. This two-tier approach will provide additional ground-truth data, allow wider projection of the field survey results, and will enhance the detection of pattern in the landscape. Ls?  1.8  1.9  2.1  2.2  An important lesson that has been learned from previous ITE surveys is that variation in field recording is a major contributory factor when assessing the statistical accuracy of change data. It is therefore important that every attempt is made to standardise recording between observers and, during the 1990 survey, quality control will be undertaken in several ways to maintain consistancy of approach. A thorough knowledge of a clear and informative Field Handbook is a vital prerequisite.  The purpose of this Handbook is to define the set of guidelines to be used during survey. Inevitably circumstances will arise which are not fully covered here; it is important that field recording should be as consistent as possible. An accompanying set of definitions is provided but, again, not every interpretation of a data item can be covered. Where atypical or doubtful categories arise, the surveyor is asked to qualify or comment on his/her choice of recording.  Further information on the background to the Countryside Survey 1990 is available from ITE, Merlewood Research Station, Grange over Sands, Cumbria. LA11 6JU.  PLANNING SITE VISITS  The sample squares have been split up into six groups (see Figure 1) and will be surveyed by teams from the six ITE Research Stations. Each team has about 85 squares to survey.  Each square is reckoned to take three days to survey, on average, with the more inaccessible sites often being the easiest to record once reached. The day-to-day working arrangements are in the hands of the Station Coordinators and will be guided by the following principles:  a. The survey teams are expected to be reasonably flexible in their working arrangements and, similarly, Station Coordinators will be sympathetic to requests for leave of absence for special occasions, when possible.  b. Travelling time is expensive both in terms of overall project time and finance - every attempt should be made to avoid returning to a site more often than is necessary, even if this involves some evening work. There will be no overtime payments, in the first instance, but any large accumulations of overtime will be compensated by ‘’time off in lieu’.  c. The costings of the project are based on a reasonable proportion of the squares being surveyed on a daily travel basis (with no overnight subsistence). Surveyors are expected to use day travel whenever it is reasonable to do so.  d. There are at least three ways of planning survey arrangements e.g.  i. daily travel from Stations for local squares ii. one week away for two or three squares iii. two or three weeks away for a group of squares (with work being undertaken at weekends, by arrangement). a  . COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990 - SITES  BaAncHoRyY EQUIPMENT  This survey requires a small amount of equipment even though it is largely a mapping and recording exercise, rather than a measuring one.  Equipment may be divided into three categories: a) provided by Merlewood  - Recording booklets (FAB’s)  - Maps of the site (1:10,000)  - Aerial photographs of the site - Handouts (explaining project) - Coloured pens  - Weatherproof clipboards  - Survey poles  - Metal marker plates  - Hammer  - Sampling equipment  ~ Navigation equipment  - Measuring tape (50 metre)  ~ Identity card  b) provided by local ITE Station  - Maps to locate sites  - Rucksack (if needed)  - Pencils and rubber  - Reference books (if needed) - Hand lens  - Camera (if needed)  - Print films  - Bivy bag  - First Aid kit  ~ Whistle  c) provided by surveyor  - Personal waterproof clothing etc. - Reference books (if available)  ~ Rucksack (if available)  - Camera (if available)  - Binoculars (if available)  GENERAL FIELD SURVEY PROCEDURE  How a square is surveyed will depend on a number of factors including the type of land, and the degree of access. However there is a recommended procedure which includes the following points:  a. On arrival at the square, surveyors should have a quick look round (where access permits), assess likely problems and generally acquaint themselves with the area.  b. Having assessed the nature of the square, the surveyors should attempt to gain permission for access to the whole square, before commencing survey (see below). Bis 2  3a3  5.4  bs Fe  3+6  c. A suitable route should be chosen which will allow a full and detailed examination of the whole square.  d. Having completed recording, surveyors should allow time to read through the records they have made, checking for omissions and ensuring full coverage and clear presentation.  PERMISSIONS  There are several reasons why permissions to survey should be sought. The most obvious is to gain legal access to all parts of the square. It is also important to ensure the goodwill of the farmer/landowner, not only to avoid an embarrassing confrontation, but to gain useful background information (see Farmer/landowner Information Sheet) and to assist data recording.  By way of an introduction, letters have been sent to all known farmers/landowners saying that the survey is taking place and asking them to expect a visit from ITE surveyors. (Separate letters have also been sent to ‘the occupier’ of farms which are likely to own land in the new sample sites.) However, they will also expect the teams to call on the day to establish that they are in the area and confirm that the arrangements for survey are satisfactory. About 75% of the sites have been visited before and so the farmers/landowners should be aware of  ITE’s work.  It is very important that all necessary permissions are confirmed before commencing survey since if a permission is refused when half the square has already been surveyed, then that work will be wasted. (Ona comforting note, only one significant refusal was experienced in the 1977/78 survey and only three in 1984).  Experience has shown that some form of permission can nearly always be gained on the day of survey, but Coordinators may prefer to make some sort of prior contact (however this latter approach may lead to delays, letters, phone calls etc.). Copies of a relevant ITE publication, containing a brief explanation of this survey, will be available to all survey teams for distribution as appropriate. Surveyors should carry some form of identity - preferably their ITE identity card.  A list of known names and addresses from previous surveys is available, and surveyors should update and supplement this list on the ownership data sheet. Details of problems, or special requirements, concerning access to land are held by the Coordinators.  There are therefore two types of farmers/landowners: those whose land we have visited before; and those who are new to us in 1990. If permission to access land is refused, the following procedures should be adopted:  a) if access is denied to all parts of a square, then all attempts at field recording should be abandoned and reports made to the Station Coordinator as soon as possible (a replacement square will be drawn at random). 6.1  b) if access is denied to any part of the square, then:  i. if an ’old’ square, then the rest of the square should be surveyed,  ii. if a '’new’ square, then survey should be abandoned as in a) above, unless the area concerned is easily surveyed from neighbouring land.  c) if permission is refused for a vegetation plot then a note should be made and the plot repositioned using guidelines shown in Section 6.2  d) every attempt should be made to contact farmers rather than their staff; where appropriate advice should be taken on who else might be informed of the survey as a matter of courtesy, eg anglers etc  DATA RECORDING (Filling in the FAB)  The Countryside Survey 1990 has three basic elements: mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling. The last of these is covered in Section 7.  MAPPING  The most geographically comprehensive element of the survey is basically a mapping exercise. Surveyors are asked to annotate a series of enlarged 6" (1:10,000) maps with a variety of information. Wherever possible, this information should be formatted according to the list of options available, but rarely it may be necessary to add other categories to the list.  In order to give as much information as possible about each area of land or landscape feature, combinations of data codes should be used to annotate each category on the map. To enable this form of coding, boxes are provided on each data recording form, which enable a series of numeric codes to be combined and represented by a single alpha character. For instance a particular length of boundary might be coded with a letter "A". In the boxes at the foot of the recording form "A" might be recorded as being a combination of codes 321, 342, 351, 353, 357, 361 where:  321 = Hawthorn hedge;  342 = <2 m high;  351 = stockproof;  353 = gaps filled along <10% length; 357 = hedge trimmed;  361 = laying.  The use of an alpha code to represent a series of numeric codes is designed to save space in marking up the map but allow a more informative record to be made.  Always use capital letters for alpha codes. Do not use "X" or "0" as these are easily confused with other symbols. Use "I" not "{". Once all the letters of the alphabet have been used through to "2", then use double codes: AA, AB, AC - AZ  BA, BB, BC - BZ ete. Bed ot  There are two types of code: primary and secondary. All features must be annotated with at least one primary code (which are shown in bold on code lists). In general, the use of more than one primary code should be avoided. However, where more than one primary code has to be used (eg multiple land use) then the code reflecting the dominant use must come first.  It is very important that the codes are used in an order which links the information logically eg a cover code always follows a species code etc  Boundaries on the maps should be clearly marked, whether actual boundaries such as fences, or interpreted ones, between two moorland vegetation types for instance. Boundaries shown on the OS map which no longer exist on the ground should be marked with the code 999 (no longer present). When annotating different boundary types then each length should be clearly defined at each end with a short line drawn perpendicular to the line of the boundary (except where a boundary junction serves to demarcate the end of a unit).  The minimum mappable area is 1/25th ha (400m2). No vegetation (except Bracken) should be mapped as a separate unit unless it comprises this area.  The minimum mappable length is 20 m (1/50th km). These units are shown on the data sheets.  Some features which are not on the agricultural/natural vegetation page of the FAB (and bracken) may be marked using a cross (X). Such features might include isolated trees, a well, or a caravan.  The surveyor in the field is the best person to make decisions about data recording. It is not useful if a decision is deferred in the field and a decision is forced on the data-processor "in the lab". Decisions must be made on the spot and, in exceptional circumstances, May be accompanied by a qualifying note or comment.  Finally, it is important that the whole square is surveyed and that even the smallest field corner, at the edge of a square, is coded.  Aerial photograph interpretation (API)  For some sites (and eventually for all) a restricted aerial photograph interpretation exercise has been undertaken by staff at ITE’s Environmental Information Centre (at Monks Wood). The work has been carried out with the following objectives in mind:  a) to assist in the identification of features which are not generally included on OS maps (such as isolated trees)  b) to indicate ‘boundaries’ between different semi-natural vegaetation types  c) to update OS maps, eg for new buildings, roads etc  There has been no attempt to interpret the land cover types or to categorise any feature.  ~S Gite?  Certain conventions and symbolic representations have been adopted during this work; these need to be learned by surveyors in advance of survey:  a) on copies of maps to be used for annotation by surveyors, all contour lines, place names and other non-essential information have been removed. (However, each team will also have a copy of the unaltered OS map)  b) any boundary that has been identified through API is marked onto the map using dashed lines - these are for guidance only and are subordinate to the surveyors judgement on the ground.  ec) any isolated/individual feature is marked as a cross (these are usually trees)  d) any boundary that has been identified as ‘no longer present’ is marked with a diamond on the line and arrows mark the extent of the feature.  It is important that this information is used wherever possible, but if it clearly conflicts with evidence on the ground, then it should be ignored and marked accordingly. At the end of the day, the API is for guidance only.  Filling in the FAB  For each square, the data recording forms, together with their 6" maps, have been combined into a booklet which, for historical reasons, is known as a Field Assessment Booklet (FAB). The order of the pages is not significant.  It is extremely important that the FABs are completed as neatly as possible. If information is not clearly interpretable by those undertaking analysis of data in due course, then effort has been wasted.  There are several general points about filling in the FAB’s. 1. The square series number should be recorded on every page.  2. Where possible, a pencil should be used - mistakes can then be erased and waterproofing is enhanced.  3. In recording semi-natural vegetation and certain other complex situations, the surveyor is asked to map recognisably different, yet mappable units. As a rule, an area should be mapped separately from another if any descriptive code applies in one case but not in the other. The units are therefore decided by the definitions of the codes which characterise them.  4. This may mean that a mosaic is recorded in a comparatively large unit, the proportions of the components being reflected in the primary ’cover codes’. In these situations, the surveyor should use the primary code which most closely fits the majority of the ground cover. 10.  Ld  Where it is impossible to choose a single primary code, then the dominant one should be recorded first in a list of codes. For example an area of Molinia/Heather moorland might be recorded as 103/175/163/176/106/175/161/180/189 where:  103 = Moorland - grass  175 = 25-50% (ie 25-50% of the mapped area is moorland grass)  163 = Molinia caerulea;  176 = 50-75% (ie 50-75% of the moorland grass is Molinia)  106 = Moorland - shrub heath  175 = 25-50% (ie 25-50% of the mapped area is moorland shrub heath)  161 = Calluna vulgaris;  175 = 25-50% (ie 25-50% of the shrub heath is Calluna)  180 = <30cm (ie the Calluna was <30cm high on average)  189 = Sheep (ie the whole area was grazed by sheep)  Point information (such as the presence of a hedgerow tree) should be marked with an X, distinguishing them from lines (such as a row of trees) and areas, delimited by a boundary.  If an area becomes too complex to record using code numbers (especially in built-up areas) then use coloured pens, showing which codes are represented by each colour in the boxes. (See further notes on colour convention under the Buildings, etc. sheet). Remember that colours cannot easily be deleted after error.  If recent change is obvious then please make use of codes where possible to show this, or else make a note on the sheet concerned.  Dotted lines after a category are intended to invite further information e.g. what type of quarry/mine or what sort of race track, etc.  To avoid cluttering the map, arrows showing a link between a code and the feature should be avoided as far as possible. Instead, the code should be written, neatly and unambiguously, immediately adjacent to the feature.  Note the guidelines for recording information in woodlands (page and immediately adjacent to non-agricultural curtilages (page  There follows a page-by-page guide on how to complete the data sheets, including some definitions or notes on those data categories which are not self-explanatory.  i. Front cover of the FAB  All sections of the cover must he completed.  NB.  Series number - this must be filled in on every page on the FAB.  Location - this should refer to the nearest village/town/geographical feature and the County or Region (in Scotland). ii. Ownership  As explained previously, permission must be obtained to access all parts of the square. During this exercise, the ownership of all Parts of the square should be established in detail and marked on the map. All the land units (e.g. fields) belonging to owner number 1 should be marked with a "1", those belonging to number 2 with a "2" etc.  The exact address and telephone number of each owner or tenant should be recorded.  While recording ownership information, please use a "T" against the name of tenant farmers, and a "C" against the name of owners of farms which have changed ownership since 1984.  The code numbers to the right of "address" are to be circled according to how interested/cooperative/helpful the owner appears to be, as follows  0  Not available or unable to judge  1 = Less than interested/cooperative/helpful 2 = Generally interested/cooperative/helpful 3 = Very interested/cooperative/helpful.  This will provide useful introductions on further possible surveys but will not be used in any way as part of an analysis etc.  If the owner asks for information on his land to be sent, this should be noted on the ownership page of the FAB.  iii. Farmer/Landowner Information  This is not intended as an official questionnaire and details recorded here will only be used as background information, hence a uniform cover of all farmers is not required. However, many farmers do like to chat about their land and in this event the surveyor is requested to steer the conversation towards the questions posed on this sheet.  The clipboard should not be much in evidence - many farmers feel inhibited by surveyors scribbling down every word they utter, but notes should be made or a summary of the conversation made on leaving the premises.  In each square, surveyors should attempt to engage at least one farmer in such conversation, preferably the one who holds most land within the square. The code from the ownership sheet should be noted and if a second "Interview" takes place, a line drawn across the page to separate the information.  iv. Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal  Inland physiographic features a  1. Cliff >30m high: a vertical or near-vertical kane of rock 2. Cliff 5-30m high: 4. 5.  6. ve. 8.  9. 10.  11.  12. 13. 14. 15. 16.  Rock outcrop & cliff <5m: areas of bare rock should be included here together with a % cover category (12-14)  Scree:  Surface boulders: boulders are defined as >50 cms in any direction and should be mapped as an area with a % cover code (12-14) Limestone pavement:  Peat hags: includes any bare or eroding peat which is not vegetated Current peat workings: where peat has obviously been extracted in the current or previous season  Old peat workings:  Soil erosion: includes both human and natural erosion in any situation  Ground levelling: includes any formerly raised area that has been reduced to the level of the surrounding terrain (eg for development)  100% rock: >50% rock: 10-50% rock: 100% peat: >50% peat:  Coastal features  31. 32. 33.  34.  = 36. 37. 38.  Cliff > 30m high:  Cliff 5-30m high:  Rock outcrop & cliff <5m: to be used when the rock is  outcropping base-rock, as opposed to ...  Rocky/Boulder shore: used when the shore is of shattered rocks or boulders >10cm diam (ie grapefruit-size)  Pebble/Gravel shore:  Sandy shore (or dune):  Bare mud:  Sea: this may seem obvious but is helpful in estuarine and coastal marsh situations - always record.  Inland water features  These features should be recorded and mapped whether they are dry at the time of survey or not.  51. 52x 53. 54. 35. 56. 57.  58. 59.  60.  Lake ~ natural: any inland water body, of any size, should be mapped using this code.  Lake - artificial: usually distinguished by the presence of a dam or embankment.  River: defined as being more than 2.5m wide; a stream is less than 2.5m. (2.5 m would be a very brave leap).  Canalised river: rivers which have been modified (eg sections straightened, banks smoothed), but which still follow the ‘same basic direction as the natural watercourse.  Canal: constructed where no watercourse existed previously. Stream: defined as being less than 2.5m wide (see River)  Roadside ditch: linear excavations with the purpose of drainage; should be recorded even if dry at the time of survey.  Other ditch: (see Roadside ditch)  Spring: usually marked on the map but implies evidence of a continual supply of water at ground surface.  Vell: 61. Signs of drainage: includes evidence of tile-drains or mole-drains ie lines of disturbance across a field.  62. Not used  63. Gorge:  64. Levee: artificial raised banks at the sides of rivers, characteristic of canalised rivers.  Banks - two codes should be used for each length of watercourse, one for each side. Record the Righthand bank first, as seen looking downstream. Measurements refer to distance on ground, not height.  65. Bank <lm: to describe the bank intimately associated with, or effected by, a watercourse ie river, stream, ditch, canal ete.; the bank would run from the ’normal’ water’s edge to a boundary, or change in land cover type.  66. Bank <5m:  67. Bank >5m:  Agriculture/Natural vegetation etc  This sheet includes most of the ground cover types in GB except urban and woodland. The first section, cover types, includes categories which may be qualified by the other codes, such as species, use or measurements.  It is important to note that these cover types should not be used ina built-up area. Once a curtilage has been recognised, as defined in Section viii, then all land within the curtilage is to be recorded according to the Section viii categories. Hence an orchard ina residential garden is not to be recorded on this sheet.  Cover types  Cover types - many of these categories need defining in the context of this survey and the definitions given may not be those with which the surveyors are familiar.  Types of grassland are notoriously difficult to distinguish, especially since their current species composition and general appearance is decided by management practices, rather than origin, history or use. Hence the primary codes are limited but there are several general descriptive codes, as well as species codes, by which such areas can be described.  Bracken is to be treated differently to other categories. Even where bracken occurs in smaller areas than a minimum mappable unit, details should be recorded using a cross (X) to mark its location.  101. Lowland agricultural grass: includes any grass crop or pasture in a generally lowland, or enclosed, situation (ie most grass)  102. Upland grassland: natural grassland (unimproved) in an upland situation but with a high proportion of palatable grasses and usually on a mineral soil. Typical species include Festuca ovina, Agrostis tenuis, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Galium saxatile, often with bracken.  103. Moorland — grass: coarse upland grass in a moorland setting, usually dominated by species such as Nardus, Molinia, Deschampsia flexuosa, Juncus squarrosus. Soils usually have a peaty top.  1d 104. 105.  106. 107. 108. 109.  Moorland — shrub heath: dominated by dwarf shrub species often growing on peat, invariably dominated by Calluna or Vaccinium Caleareous grassland: found on calcareous soils and with a high proportion of calcicole species of limestone, chalk, dunes and machair. Typical species include Bellis perennis, Lotus corniculatus, Linum catharticum, Thymus druceii, Poterium sanguisorba, and Briza media.  Maritime vegetation: found on sea cliffs or other coastal situations and usually herb-rich due to salt spray.  Lowland heath: shrub heath at low altitudes and in lowland England and Wales, usually characterised by dry soils.  Aquatic macrophytes: major species characteristic of standing water such as Typha, Ranunculus fluitans and Phragmites.  Aquatic marginal veg: growing at the fringe of open water eg Valeriana, Epilobium hirsutum, Filipendula, Oenanthe croccata etc  There are various classifications of bogs, mires etc; the following division is a compromise.  110.  111.  112.  113.  114. 115.  116.  Raised bog: occurs mainly in lowland situations, often formed in level flood plains of mature rivers; typically convex and gently sloping from the centre to a steep margin and bounded by a watercourse.  Blanket bog: characteristic of large areas in north-west, upland, high-rainfall parts of Britain. Characterised by Eriophorum with or without Sphagnum; other species include Molinia, Trichophorum, Calluna and Erica tetralix.  Valley bog: (including basin mires) form in depressions where there is a slow, directional flow of water.  Fen: lowland peat usually dominated by sedges or rushes often with alder or willow.  Marsh: Nutrient-rich wetland on predominantly inorganic soil dominated by rushes or sedges.  Flush: Localised, narrow areas of moving water which tend to have species which are different from surrounding vegetation. Calcareous flushes are characterised by species such as Prunella vulgaris, Plantago lanceolata, Linum catharticum and Parnassia palustris and are relatively rare. Non-calcareous flushes are usually dominated by rushes, often with sphagnum.  Saltmarsh: Should only be recorded where the area is vegetated, otherwise bare mud (Physiography section) is appropriate.  117-132 These categories are self-explanatory even though young crops may be difficult to recognise. The following notes may help:  117. 118. 119. 120. 121.  - cereal crops are nearly always drilled in rows with a high proportion of soil visible between the plants.  - wheat plants have broad, glaucus blades with auricles.  ~ barley has dull green leaves and auricles.  - oat plants have broad soft glaucus leaves with no auricles. Wheat: Barley: Oats:  Sugar beet: Turnips/Swedes/Roots: 122. 123. 124. 125. 126. 127. 128. 129. 130. 131. 132. 133.  134.  136.  Le  138. 139. 140. 141.  142.  143.  144. 145.  ly  Kale:  Potatoes:  Field Beans:  Peas:  Maize:  Rye:  Oilseed rape:  Other crop ....  Flowers:  Commercial horticulture:  Orchard:  Unmanaged grass: this is grassland that has no obvious use (agricultural, amenity etc) but which cannot be called an abandoned land use. (Wide roadside verges, only cut once/twice per year, may be coded as unmanaged grass - or tall herb vegetation, as appropriate).  Tall herb vegetation: semi-natural vegetation, often in wet or disturbed positions; dominated by tall herbs but with grasses present.  Ley: a short-term grassland, re-seeded less than five years previously. Characterised by evidence of ploughing, bare soil between grass plants, scarcity of broadleaf species and is often dominated by a single grass species eg Lolium. This code should only be used if there is absolutely no doubt about these factors (eg from landowner information or recent sowing). Any field with more than 10% Lolium multiflorum (a short-lived ley species) would be included here.  Unimproved grass: pasture in an enclosed situation which contains many palatable grasses but which has not been agriculturally improved by the use of fertilisers or other agricultural inputs. A comparatively rare category, containing species such as Conopodium majus, Planatago lanceolata, Lotus corniculatus etc. Would include most ‘hay meadows’.  Forbs >10%:  Forbs >252:  Forbs >50%:  Neglected: agricultural land for which there is no obvious intended change of use, but where the former use has been temporarily neglected (for up to 3 years). Fallow land (which has been unused as part of an agricultural rotation) should be recorded here. Set aside land should also be recorded here (but only if identified without doubt)  Abandoned: agricultural land which has been neglected for more than 3 years and in which long-lived perennials and shrubby species are becoming established.  Ploughed: the crop harvested before ploughing should be identified (from fragments that remain) and this code used as an extra description.  Burnt (moorland): land which has been burned deliberately as a Management practice e.g. for grouse (muirburn).  Mown: to be used for any grassland type that has been mown  such that the ‘normal’ vegetative structure of grasses is not present and therefore hinders species identification.  \ 1S  Species (if >25% cover)  The following major agricultural grasses and semi-natural ground cover species (which are listed according to a gradient from rich to poor land) are recorded if they cover 25% or more of a mapped unit, irrespective of the number of canopies present (ie total cover can reach more than 100%). For any species which is not listed here and which reaches 25% cover, one of the blank code numbers should be used:  146. Lolium multiflorum 158. Juncus effusus  147. Lolium perenne 159. Deschampsia flexuosa 148. Trifolium repens 160. Nardus stricta  149. Dactylis glomerata 161. Calluna vulgaris  150. Anthoxanthum odoratum 162. Vaccinium myrtillus 151. Phleum pratense 163. Molinia caerulea  152. Cynosurus cristatus 164. Eriophorum angustifolium 153. Holcus lanatus 165. Eriophorum vaginatum 154. Agrostis tenuis 166. Tricophorum cespitosum 155. Festuca ovina 167. Sphagnum spp  156. Pteridium aquilinum - dense 168. Juncus squarrosus  157. Pteridium aquilinum - scattered Cover  175-178 These cover % codes should be used with the species codes 146-168 and, where a mosaic of vegetation categories exists, with land cover types. No more than three cover codes may be used to describe any area.  175. 25-502: 176. 50-752: 177. 75-952: 178. 95-1002:  Heights (Calluna & Pteridium)  179-184 These height class codes should only be used with Bracken and Heather and should reflect the average height of the stand at the time of survey.  179. <10cms: 180. <30cms: 181. <50cms: 182. <1m: 183. <1.5m: 184. >1.5m:  Uses etc  These codes should be used to qualify the cover types where known. Stock type can be told from recent dung as well as presence of animals.  185. Beef: should include ‘’sucklers’ (0-6 mths) and /’rearers’ (6 mths  onwards)  186. Dairy: N.B. mixed herds of beef cattle and dairy cattle should be coded 176/177  187. Breeders: only to be used if it is confirmed that the primary purpose of the herd is for breeding. : 188. Dual purpose: applies to the few remaining cattle breeds which are bred for beef and milk production e.g. Simmentals, South Devons, some Shorthorns and some Fresians.  189. Sheep:  190. Goats (with no.): the numbers of goats and horses in fields should be recorded where possible, including those animals in a field, only part of which is in the square. Numbers should follow the code (in parentheses).  191. Horses (with no.):  192. Pigs:  193: Silage: Silage fields can be distinguished from hay fields only after cutting (silage-cut stems are fresh, bright green: hay fields usually produce dried grass remnants), or by asking the farmer.  194. Hay: should only be used if there is firm evidence eg wisps of dry grass after harvesting  195. Deer: only to be used if there is firm evidence including presence of animals or dung, artificial feeds, estate information  196. Grouse: as for deer  197. No apparent use: should be used if the primary use of the land cannot be identified.  vi. Forestry/Woodland/Trees  The codes from the woodland sheet should be used to describe each ‘woodland unit’ (ranging from a single sapling to a forestry plantation) and every combination of codes must contain at least one primary code. Features from other pages of the FAB should not be recorded within woodland, unless they are above a minimum mappable unit in size (ie exceeding 1/25th ha), and excepting bracken.  Trees/scrub should be recorded in any situation except inside the curtilages of buildings or as individuals or lines immediately adjacent to non-agricultural curtilages.  Trees should be recorded from all recreation land such as golf courses and playing fields (except in urban situations). It is  important that the double use of land is recorded eg individual trees growing in farmland, or sheep grazing in an abandoned orchard.  Tree species (with apical dominance leading to the formation of recognised trunks) of all sizes should be rcorded, as should shrubby species (comprising scrub).  Cover types - all occurences of trees should be allocated to one of  the primary codes and qualified by secondary codes - if any one area of trees includes distinct variation in age or species composition, then the unit should be sub-divided into blocks and coded separately.  Iw The following key should allow any feature to be placed in one of the primary code definitions:  1. Exclusively shrubby species? .......eceeeeee YES: «« 2 NO .. 5  2. Less than 6 individuals? ............ TTC YES .. Code 207 NO .. 3  3. At least 20m line of single specimen width? YES .. Code 209 NO .. 4  4. Canopy covers less than 25% of area? ....... YES .. Code 208 NO .. Code 210  5. Less than 6 individuals? .... cece eeeeeeee YES .. Code 201 NO .. 6  6. Less than 0.25 ha with canopy >25% area? ... YES .. Code 205 NO .. 7  7. Linear feature (ratio 1:5 and < 50m width)? YES .. 8 NO .. 9  8. Single tree width? ....... cc cece eee ee ee cee YES .. Code 203  NO .. Code 204  9. Canopy cover less than 252%? ....... cc ceeeeee YES .. Code 202 NO .. Code 206  201. Individual trees: should be marked with a cross. Groups of less than 6 trees should be recorded as individuals as should lines of trees of less than 20 m in length. A coppice stool is recorded as a single tree.  202. Scattered trees: do not make a wood or clump (see definitions) because their crowns are not contributing 25% cover of the mapped unit.  203. Line of trees: must be single tree width and be at least 20 m long with crown contact. They should be marked with a line.  204. Belt of trees: 2 or more trees wide with a width to length ratio of at least 1:5, parallel-sided and with a maximum width of 50m.  205. Clump of trees: a small woodland or group of trees (6 or more) and of less than 0.25 ha.  206. Woodland/Forest: an area of trees of more than 0.25 ha (but see Belt) and a crown cover of more than 25%.  207. Individual scrub: consists exclusively of shrubby species often with tree regeneration and brambles. Individual trees of more than twice the average height of the scrub should be separately marked as individuals or scattered.  208. Scattered scrub: scattered as for trees.  209. Line of scrub: line as for trees.  210. Patch of scrub: an area of continuous scrub (canopy >25%) of any size.  215. Closed canopy: canopies touching or overlapping  216. Canopies not touching: to be used for linear features, if the gap between two canopies does not exceed the average canopy width of the two individuals on either side. 217. Hedgerow: trees in a hedgerow which are twice the average height of the hedge, or where the hedge has been trimmed to favour the growth of a young tree. They should be marked with an X.  218. Parkland: a series of isolated mature trees over usually grazed grassland, often associated with large country houses or recreational areas.  Species (if >25%) - should be recorded with one of the cover types if they constitute more than 25% of the canopy. It is not necessary to qualify "unspecified conifer" or "unspecified broadleaf" with a species name. The mixed category codes should be used in the same way ie when >25%.  221. Fir -— Douglas  222. Larch  223. Pine - Corsican 224. Pine -— Lodgepole 225. Pine - Scots  226. Spruce — Norway 227. Spruce - Sitka  228. Unspecified conifer  231. Alder  232. Ash  233. Beech  234. Birch  235. Bramble 236. Elder  237. Elm  238. Field maple 239. Gorse  240. Hawthorn 241. Hornbeam 242. Lime  243. Oak  244. Poplar  245. Rowan  246. Sweet Chestnut 247. Sycamore 248. Willow  250. Mixed broadleaves 251. Mixed conifers 252. Unspecified broadleaf  Proportions - these are for use with the tree species codes and should refer to the percentage cover of the dominant canopy layer. No more than three codes should be used to describe any one feature.  256. 25-502 257. 50-75% 258. 75-95%  259. 95-100% Age - should be used in conjunction with any of the cover-type codes.  To help with age category recognition the following table may be of use. These figures are a guideline and individuals will vary according to vigour, climate and other environmental factors, particularly fast-growing species of exotic origin. Further information is available in "Trees of Britain and Europe" by Mitchell.  Age (yrs.) Diam. at breast height  , 3-4 cm  20 18-20 cm  100 70-75 cm 261. 1-4 yrs 262. 5-20 yrs  263. > 20 yrs 264. > 100 yrs  Use - To be used for an area of trees (ie not individuals). It can be extremely difficult to decide the use and many woodlands, especially broadleaved, appear to have no particular use. These should be left uncoded in terms of use.  266. Timber production: all(?) coniferous forest and highly managed broadleaved woodland is likely to be included here.  267. Landscape: usually covering trees planted to improve the amenity of a site (usually visual amenity), or to fringe and ‘hide’ commercial plantations.  268. Sporting/Game: to be used if there is clear evidence that the wood is used to rear pheasants or other game birds.  269. Public recreation: where there is active encouragement for the public to use the area for recreation eg car parks, forest walks, arboreta etc.  270. Nature conservation: only to be used if there is clear evidence that the feature is being managed for nature conservation purposes.  271. Shelter: includes signs of wintering livestock as well as windbreaks etc.  Condition (to be used with woodland/forest >0.25 ha only)  275. Managed: to be used if there are clear signs of management activity for the primary use of the woodland area, eg, for timber production: weeding, thinning, brashing/snedding; for amenity: planting; for nature conservation: planting, scrub clearance etc  276. Unmanaged - thriving: no signs of active management but healthy trees, varied age structure and regeneration present.  277. Unmanaged ~ improvable: no signs of active management with healthy trees but no structure and grazing preventing natural regeneration  278. Declining: trees not healthy, often old, and with no structure and no regeneration; no longer woodland if existing trees removed.  Descriptions/Features  281. Felling/Stumps:  282. Natural regeneration: to be used only where tree species <1.3m high, which have grown naturally from seed (or suckers) are outside the canopy of a dominant woodland feature.  i> 283. Underplanting: where semi-natural woodland has been under-planted with standard exotics or native species.  284. Planted: Planted may be used with any of the cover types where it is obvious that planting has taken place, rather than self-seeding.  285. Ploughed land: to be used where land has been ploughed (or scarified) in advance of forestry planting.  286. Staked trees: to be used for isolated trees only and not where 288 applies.  287. Tree protectors: light-weight plastic tubes (about 1 m high) which provide protection as well as a favourable micro-climate for planted trees.  288. Fenced (single trees):  289. Windblow: can be used to qualify an area of forest or a single individual which has clearly been blown over, or had the top blown out, by wind.  290. Dead standing tree(s): recorded either singly or as a description for an area of woodland.  291. Regrowth - cut stump: applies to isolated regenerating trees  292. Grazing (stock): to be used if there is any evidence of agricultural stock using the feature for grazing, intentionally or otherwise.  293. Ride/Firebreak:  294. Bracken dense: any bracken in a woodland area must be recorded as for codes 156 and 157.  295. Bracken scattered:  i. Boundaries  All boundaries should be recorded unless they form part of a curtilage or they are within the canopy of a woodland (except that boundaries of woodlands must be recorded). It is important that the boundary between urban and rural is marked, but it need not be coded if a curtilage is involved.  It is the total boundary feature which is to be coded, using a combination of primary codes if appropriate (eg fence with hedge). In these cases, the most complete (stockproof) element of the boundary should be coded first.  Walls  301. Dry-—stone:  302. Mortared: includes dry-stone walls which have been capped with mortared stone.  303. Other: ... (include a description)  Fences  311. Wood only:  312. Iron only:  313. Wire on posts:  314. Other: ... (include a description)  ne Hedges  It can be difficult to distinguish between ‘mature’ hedges and lines of  trees.  A hedge is defined as woody vegetation that has been subject to  a regime of cutting in order to maintain a linear shape. When hedge management is abandoned, and the natural shape of the tree is regained,  then 321.  322. 323.  the feature can no longer be described as a hedge.  >50% Hawthorn: only to be used if Hawthorn constitutes more than half of the length of hedge under consideration. >50% Other: .... (specify)  Other  331. 332.  333.  Mixed hedge: should be used for any length of hedge where no single species dominates.  Stone bank:  Earth bank: N.B. stone and earth banks are common and should be  coded as 331/332 Grass strip: to be used where a grass strip separates two fields with no vertical boundary.  Descriptions  341.  342.  343.  B51.  352. 353.  354. 355. 356.  >2m high: if different heights apply on either side of the boundary, then the height should apply to the side on which stock are kept; otherwise, the lowest height category should be used. <2m high:  <1m high:  Stockproof: where possible, this should apply to the stock that would normally use the surrounding fields; if in doubt, assume sheep  Not stockproof:  Filled gaps <10%: should be used to show that the boundary has had gaps which have been filled in an attempt to make it stockproof. The %’s refer to the gaps as a % of the boundary unit being coded. Filled gaps >10%:  Signs of replacement: (of one boundary type by another)  Signs of removal:  Codes 357 - 360 represent a transistion from a well managed, trimmed hedge, to a relict line of shrubs.  Sols 358. 359. 360.  361. 362.  Trimmed: signs of management within the previous 12 months and a neat, cropped appearance.  Uncut: has had recent management but has been ‘let go’. over one or more seasons.  Derelict: still obviously a hedge but all attempts at management having been abolished.  Line of relict hedge: usually a line of shrubs showing where a hedge has once been (see definition of hedge; can be used in addition to codes on the forestry page)  Laying (recent): to be used if it appears likely that the hedge has been layed in the last five years.  Flailing: to be used if flailed in the last year; recognisable by smashed and shattered ends to cut branches. :  oA viii.  363. Regrowth from stumps: this applies to hedges that have been cut to ground level but have sprouted again, often at intervals along the old boundary.  364. Bracken present: to be used if any bracken is present in the boundary.  Buildings/Structures/Communications  This sheet covers features associated with built structures and routes of communication. Note that features which are immediately adjacent to a non-agricultural curtilage (except roads) need not be recorded on other FAB pages. Similarly no information from other FAB pages need to be recorded within a curtilage (except trees - see 402 below)  Colour Coding - if using colours because code numbering is too complex then please use the following choice of colours wherever possible:  Grey = Residential Building  Yellow = Agricultural curtilage (+ green dots with trees >10% cover)  Green-solid = other curtilage without trees  Green-dots = other curtilage with trees  Orange = Commercial Buildings  Dark Blue = Public Service Buildings  Purple = Religious Buildings  Pink = Road (tarmac)  Red = New development  Other buildings and grounds should be number-coded, most being large enough to accommodate a written code.  Cover types  Built-cover types - these categories should cover the majority of "urban" land and built features in the countryside but special codes may be needed on rare occasions. Where possible they should be qualified by use and description codes.  A curtilage is an area of ground that is associated with a building and which has a use linked with that building eg gardens, ‘grounds’, forecourts etc. Apart from the presence of trees (cf code 402), it is not necessary to record any features within curtilages. If in doubt about whether a feature is a curtilage, then only treat it as such in an urban situation (eg land around a rural resevoir is not curtilage).  401. Building: usually present on the map - the exceptions will be new buildings which must be coded or coloured with code 441.  Gardens/Grounds apply to curtilages associated with residential or other buildings. Gardens/Grounds may be mapped and coded in groups if they are all alike.  402. Garden/grounds with trees: Gardens/Grounds with trees includes those curtilages or mapped group of curtilages, which have a cover of 10% or more.  403. Garden/grounds without trees:  404. Public open space: includes Parks, Ornamental Gardens and Accessible Common Land, especially near large conurbations. as  405. Amenity grass >lha: non-agricultural grass which is clearly being used for amenity purposes (not recreation); to be recorded in units of lha or more eg parks, large lawns etc (but see 404). Should be used on golf courses.  406. Allotments:  407. Car park:  408. Glasshouse: refers to commercial, large-scale enterprises, not greenhouses at the bottom of gardens.  409. Garden Centre/Nursery:  410. Embankment: to be used for any constructed embankment in any situation eg motorway, resevoir etc.  411. Other land ....: for use in exceptional circumstances; try and use other primary codes first. Always qualify.  Use - these categories should be used to describe the cover type.  421. Residential: covers all domestic living area.  422. Commercial: includes all buildings devoted to selling things, including shops, garages, hotels, pubs, commercial offices etc.  423. Industrial: those used for the manufacture of goods and include workshops, warehouses and associated buildings such as stores.  424. Public Service & facilities: Public Services and facilities are those buildings which are associated with services available to the public, such as Police Stations, Hospitals, Libraries and facilities associated with electricity, gas and telephone.  425. Institutional: includes all buildings belonging to forms of public or private institutions, such as old peoples homes, local government and central government buildings, MOD buildings, Crown land, Remand homes, Prisons and even Research Stations.  426. Educational/Cultural: includes schools, establishments of further education, museums, theatres and cinemas.  427. Religious: confined to places of worship including Churches, Mosques and Synagogues, and their curtilages eg graveyards, cemetries etc.  428. Agricultural:  429. Sporting/Recreational:  430.

Derelict: buildings or land that have been abandoned or neglected such that they are beyond ordinary repair.  Communications  451. Railway track/land: 452. Road (tarmac): includes any road, whether private or not, which is totally tarmac across its width.  453-445 Verges should be marked separately for each side of the road so that two numeric codes should be used to describe the verges for the length of road concerned (even if they are the same). Record the ‘northmost’ verge first. If road runs north-south, then record ‘eastmost’ first. If there is no verge (eg tarmac up to a wall) then do not use a code at all. Verges should be mapped adjacent to constructed tracks, as well as tarmac roads.  453. Verge <1m: 454. Verge <5m: 455. Verge >5m:  456. Constructed track: includes any track which has been manufactured using stone or hard material.  457. Unconstructed track: those tracks which are not defined as above ie no construction has been involved along their length.  458. Footpath (exclusive): a path which uses land area for the purposes of a footpath only - often walled or fenced.  459. Footpath (other): those which are shared with some other land use, such as a path across a grazed field.

No longer on map:  VEGETATION RECORDING General  In 1977/8, as part of the first ITE national sample survey, detailed information on plant species was collected from quadrats and from linear plots adjacent to some features (hedges, roads and streams). In 1988, a sub-sample of the original sites were re-recorded and changes noted. As a result of this work, the quadrats are to be resurveyed again in 1990 as part of a monitoring programme looking at changes in the quality of land cover types, as well as overall changes taking place.  As well as recording vegetation data from plots visited earlier, new plots are to be established which will give more information on specific elements of rural vegetation; these are concerned particularly with linear features and semi-natural habitat types.  Although the earlier plots will have to relocated using mapped information only, all plots visited in 1990 will be permanently marked using metal plates; other information (including measurements, sketch maps, and aerial photographs) will assist in future plot location. These permanent markers will allow more accurate identification of plots in future surveys.  Method of recording vegetation  The survey requires recording from different sizes of vegetation plot and fuller descriptions of each are given below. However, the basic recording procedure is the same for all types of plot and a standardised recording sheet has been devised (Figure 2). It has the following sections:  a) Header - information on the broad environmental and management attributes of the plot should be recorded, according to the parameters listed. Land use may be marked as N/A.  b) Listed species - the main part of the form is taken up with a list of 200 common species of plants (herbs, grasses, bryophytes). Where any of these is present, then the species name should be  AS 200m2 (large) QUADRAT x Comments : ’ 1  moderate steep  rel. 7e;*[*) Jayx{*] [fat*{x] fal |__| jaastritdud | | |  Pf a |  Bareground | || | tsaenovag | | | [118Cratmon [|| 311 Ping wl | |_|  ra13 Barley | | | _|e2eumneaa | | | [2icrense. | [| | [aaatritpra | | Fasawheat [|| | a0duncbul || | |890Dacamac] | || 316 Plan ma | | [ado tritrep [| | | Grasses ||| [eat dunecon| | | _|132Digipur [| | [aeaPoyad | [| [eet tripmar | | rioAgoean | |b | eaaduncet || | [1360rosr | [| [azapoiyper | | | [asaUexeur | | | | aagwrep || easwunesqu| | | | 140empenig[ [| [asspoywu [ [| faszunicio | | | Fit Agosto | tt | 2eoumueim | [| [141 enaynon[ {| [sa6Poteans [7 [| f4saVaccmyr] || rizagoten ||| [asticcae | | | [agent [|| [sarPoeew | [| [4erVvemaw | | | rao Aiopgen”| || IRERNSete || | |747epimon | | | | as0Poterep | | | [4s0Verocha| | | rat Ap era tlt | ata | | | [tasepipa | [| [aezprimv | [| [artveroot | | | da anh odo | ||| sales | | | _[ts0€nccin | | | [aaspnnwi | | | [a7evermser | | | Favanhela [LL ia7byoat! || | _[tsteicter [| | [eaeprnspi || | [arrViisep | | |  Shen TTL se ono | T[teocuome | || [aso verse [| fae Vit [TT Bary TTL iar avian [tier | [| [ast Ranvace [| [Tenover eaten car [TT Lf eaePteraqy || rorrenee | [| _[354Ranatic [| [ [so vero per [|  et Bemse TTI eORaSWOODYSe | [i77Gaiapa [| [| [956Ranvta | [| |wossesaichens || | Haart TL] acer | [| 1e2Gatpat | | | | ss7Ranwrep [|| lesommess. | [| peDetge TTL a Achim [| 188 Ga sox [| [a0 Rosase.

(It has been found that the species list from most plots is made up very largely from the species already listed on the recording form with perhaps 10% having to be added.)  In all cases a sketch should be included on the back of the recording sheet which shows the position of the plot and all relevant measurements and angles, as described below. All vascular plants should be recorded, together with a restricted list of bryophytes and lichens. The list of aggregates and restricted list is given in Tables 1 and 2. Species which cannot be easily identified should be collected and pressed for later identification. Mosses/lichens growing on rocks/trees should be ignored.  Estimates of cover should then be made within 5% categories. It is necessary to constantly check between partners that there is not a tendency to over or under estimate. Cover may be over 100% if several layers are present e.g. Pteridium over Agrostis. Species with less than 5% cover are not given cover values.  Cover of tree species, if rooted in the plot, should be recorded in the normal way; there is no need to record any difference between seedlings and adult trees. Tree species which are overhanging the plot should have cover recorded in the second % cover column.  "Bare ground" includes leaf litter and rock.  Plot types  The following types of plots are to be recorded in each square: Quadrats bie 5 x 200 m2 quadrats — pre-positioned at random  ii. 5 x 4 m2 quadrats - to be placed in semi-natural vegetation types  Linear plots iii. up to 5 linear boundary plots, in enclosed land only iv. up to 2 linear hedgerow plots v. up to 5 linear steamside plots  vi. up to 5 linear roadside plots Of the 512 squares that will be surveyed in 1990, 128 will be ‘new’ and a further 128 will not have had vegetation plots recorded in them before. In these 256 squares, linear plots will not have been marked on Maps; the surveyor will need to apply rules (given below) to identify the location of these features within the square.  LARGE QUADRATS (X1 - X5) Location/Relocation  These large quadrats (200m2 - "Wally plots") will be marked on the maps in advance, and should be located as accurately as possible. About half of them will have been recorded in 1977/8 and precise relocation is essential.  There will be instances where the land use has changed so that a vegetation quadrat is no longer appropriate eg a field has been developed into a housing estate. If the new land use is characterised by a vegetation in which a quadrat can be placed (eg golf-course) then the original position should be relocated and a quadrat should be recorded. Where the new land use clearly precludes the recording of vegetation, a new quadrat position should be selected as follows:  Locate a boundary between the developed area of land and the nearest acceptable land cover type; locate a position on that boundary which is nearest to the original plot; take 20 (twenty) paces in the opposite direction to the original plot; record full details of the changes involved.  Laying out and recording  The vegetation plot is 200 m2 and is set up by using the survey poles provided with the strings forming the diagonal of the square (Figure 3) The diagonals should be orientated carefully at right angles and the quadrat should be orientated with the strings on the North/South, East/West axes. The different plot size markings shown in Figure 3 are marked by different coloured strings on the appropriate position off the diagonal.  Details of the quadrat should be entered at the top of the recording form according to the prompts given. Any additional comments, not covered elsewhere, should be entered in the space provided.  Using the recording form provided, all species are recorded from the inner nested (4m2) quadrat first, either by striking out the species names on the "top 200" list or by adding species names at the bottom of the recording form. A "1" should then be recorded in the column headed "Q" to show that the species was recorded in the first quadrat. The cover, in 5% bands, should then be shown in the second column (marked 5  When the inner quadrat has been completed, the second nested quadrat should be examined and any additional species should be recorded using a "2" in the "Q" column. No cover estimate is made at this stage. The procedure continues until all sizes of quadrats have been recorded. Only after a final check for any missed recordings is a final overall cover estimate made for all species with a cover of 5% or more in the whole 200m2 quadrat. yi  18 Figure 3 Plot Layout and Equipment  ( re eer = Right-angle -— Polythene distance string gauge ‘ + coloured marker tag ‘™ 1" Whit. stud and nut ee b Srp peo = fpmag)  | Cup hook Dog lead clip Split ring i Screw eye \ Corner post Cenire post Plot layout x 1"x 3'app) (1"x1"x 3'app.) (1xcentre+4 corner posts)  vii: an did i KS Sl ee ee SF Re ie ee RS Si Fe  Sides Halt-diagonals  _ 2.00m -1.42m 5.00m ee er een 3.54m 7.07m 5.00m  10.00m  «¢  & bo Ngeeerercrccr tg 707m  14.44m 10.00m  wee ee  Pee  al ee  oe eww ow we Cem ememn ee mm nwa neta nm aw ewww ee ew eee eee naw er enna n naw nwananwnnaenm ane nae ee eee ee  Mw eS SS Se If the plot falls in a field with a growing crop (whether harvested or not) then the plot should be moved to the edge of the field nearest to the original position. The new plot should be taken as being a 14m Square (estimated, not measured), starting 3 metres into the crop (to avoid any edge effect). Access should be made using drill lines where possible and causing minimum disturbance to the crop (or where the crop may be on a future visit). The species list should be compiled from what can be seen in the crop - accuracy is difficult te achieve but samples must be taken from arable crops however possible.  Permanent marking  Wherever possible, the quadrat should be marked with a metal plate immediately adjacent to the south corner of the quadrat. This should be possible in most unenclosed land and in woodlands. The plate should not be within the quadrat itself; it should be driven into the ground at an angle of 45 degrees until the top edge is just below ground level (aligned to give maximum likelihood of easy relocation with a metal detector). Wooden stakes may be suitable in woodlands and moorland situations where metal plates would be difficult to re-locate.  Elsewhere, in cultivated land or wet habitats, quadrats should be marked by inserting a plate at the nearest field boundary, along a cardinal bearing line (Figure 4). The distance of the boundary from the quadrat should be measured from the centre of the quadrat to the centre of the boundary. In semi~enclosed areas where plate burial is inappropriate and where boundaries are more than 100 metres away, there should be an attempt to mark the plot by reference to an obvious local feature, such as a boulder or tree where the plate should be buried (N.B. see Boundary Plots for definitions of field boundary)  Figure 4 - locating a Boundary plot  WA ELE ii.  In all cases, the position of the quadrat, and marker plate(s) should be sketched on the reverse of the recording sheet, and annotated with distances (measured with a tape) and, if measurements are not possible, compass bearings. All distances should be measured from the centre of the plot to easily recognisable, and permanent, features in the surrounding landscape. A print photograph should be taken (see Photography).  SMALL QUADRATS (Y1 - Y5)  Location/Relocation  Five small quadrats (2m x 2m) should be placed in natural or semi-natural land cover types in each square. They will be placed by the surveyor according to the following guidelines:  1. The five quadrats should be placed in five different land cover types, where these are available, additional to those types that have already been represented by the five large quadrats.  2. The plot locations should be determined after all land cover mapping has been completed. During the mapping phase, the presence of small areas of natural or semi-natural vegetation which are below the size of a minimum mappable unit should be noted (and mapped, if helpful). Land cover categories which are additional to the mapping codes might include:  Strandline vegetation Dune slack  Dune grassland  Dune scrub  Machair  Inland saltmarsh Inundation grassland Ultrabasic vegetation Calcareous flush Acid/neutral flush Bryophyte dominated springs Montane heath  Rock ledges  3. If the total number of different semi-natural and natural land cover types exceeds five, then random numbers should be used to draw five types for sampling (remembering not to sample those already represented within the large quadrats). Where there is more than one area of a type, then the largest area should be chosen.  4. If there are fewer than five additional land cover types available in which to place the plots, then the placing of quadrats will be proportional to the size of land cover types available (ie the larger land cover types receive more quadrats). This can be done by dividing the areas of each type into "mappable areas" and comparing sizes. Positions of plots within each area can also be achieved by the use of a grid and random numbers.  3 32  5. In all cases, a complete record of suitable habitats should be recorded, together with the frequency of each. The five plot numbers should be indicated on the same list, as shown in the  following example: xp LYS (romsow| Chalk grassland fi) 232 4 (S53 G Fen | (2) 7! Marsh i 2 3 Decid. woodland : @ a.  lan  Conif. woodland a 7 ws  7  Saltmarsh T) Ve CY  Laying out and recording  The quadrat should be placed in the ’centre of gravity’ of the habitat - this is a large element of judgement involved but efforts should be made to avoid bias in positioning of the plot. If the centre of gravity is not representative of the habitat type (eg rock boulder in middle of flush), then re-randomise the plot location.  If the plot is put into a linear feature within which a 2x2 m plot will not fit then the area should be made up to 4m2 by extending the length - this should be clearly depicted with measurements in the sketch on the back of the recording sheet.  The survey poles should be used to mark out the corners of the quadrat by reference to the first set of marker strings (equivalent to the inner nested quadrat of the large quadrats). As with large quadrats, the poles should be orientated along north/south, east/west axes. However, in a linear feature, this may not be possible and the main axis of the plot should be measured and recorded.  The species present in the square should be recorded in the same way as for the inner nested quadrat of the large quadrats and a cover estimate made.  Permanent marking  In many cases it will be possible to place the plate immediately adjacent to the survey pole at the south point of the quadrat, but just outside (6") the quadrat boundary. If the plate has to be placed elsewhere, around the perimeter of the quadrat, then this should be clearly shown on the associated sketch.  If it is not possible to place the plate adjacent to the quadrat, then it should be placed at the nearest possible location and distances and angles measured to show the precise location. BOUNDARY PLOTS (Bl — B5) General rules for linear (10 x 1m) plots:  1. No two linear plots of the same type should be placed within 10m of each other on the same linear feature.  2. No two linear plots of different types should overlap.  3. The 1 metre width should be measured across the surface of the terrain so that, on a bank, the true horizontal width, as viewed from above, would be less than 1 metre.  Location/Relocation  In enclosed land only, a boundary linear plot is to be recorded at the boundary marker of each of the 5 x 200m2 quadrats (see Figure 4).  In this context, a boundary is taken to be any physical feature that has a length and which is an interface between the land cover of the 200m2 plot and any other land cover type. This might include a hedge, wall, fence, ditch, embankment etc. It will not include land cover which is associated with the management practice of the field eg headlands.  In general the Boundary plot will take precedence over other types of linear plot. If two plots would otherwise end up in the same location, then the Boundary plot would be laid out and the other linear feature moved to the nearest permissable length of boundary which was at least 10m away. The exception is where a linear plot has previously been located in the same position as a Boundary plot would fall. In this case the Boundary plot would be moved to the next nearest length of boundary on a different cardinal bearing.  The marker plate for the 200m2 plot should have been positioned at the boundary nearest to the plot and and should be lying on one of the cardinal points of the compass, as measured from the centre of the plot.  Laying out and recording  The linear plot should be laid out with the marker plate on the right side of the plot when you are facing it from the field. In most cases the feature recorded will be vertical, ie. a hedge, wall or fence - in these cases the plot should be 1m from the centre of the feature. In some cases where there is no vertical feature, but a grass strip, the plate should be buried 1m in from the edge of the field (crop), and the linear plot should be recorded in the 1m adjacent to the edge.  Where the boundary is composed of several different elements eg hedge with ditch, then the laying out procedure should be decided by reference to the dominant vertical feature eg hedges/walls/fences are dominant to ditches which are dominant to grass strips. Once the dominant feature has been identified and the plot laid out accordingly, then recording takes place in the 1m strip, irrespective of whether it includes part of another linear feature. (N.B. different rules apply in the case of H, S/W, R/V plots - see below)  35 iv.  34  Boundary plots which are adjacent to large ditches or dykes should be located at the water’s edge, and not at the top of the bank. Where a  field is immediately adjacent to a curtilage, then the boundary plot  should run from the curtilage into the field.  All species within the plot are recorded using standard recording forms and cover estimates made.  Permanent marking  The plot is already marked by the plate for the adjacent 200m2. Note that the plot lies to the left of the marker when viewed from the field.  HEDGEROW PLOTS (Hi - H2) Location/Relocation  In the case of squares recorded in 1978, the original positions will be marked on the map - they should be relocated as closely as possible. If there is no longer a hedgerow at the position marked, then this should be indicated on the map and the plot should be moved to the nearest hedgerow - this new plot should be renamed (H3, H4) and marked on the map.  If one or both hedges are not marked on the map but hedges exist in the square, they should be added using the methodology developed in 1978 (see para 6.2.4). However 2 plots should not be nearer than 10m to each other, so if there is not more than 20m of hedge in the square, only one plot should be recorded.  In the case of squares which were not recorded in 1978, the position of these 2 plots should be located using the methodology developed in 1978, (see para 6.2.4). The plot should be on the side of the linear feature closest. to the quadrat.  Laying out and recording  The position of the plots should be temporarily marked with a survey pole at each end, one metre out from the centre of the hedge (see  Figure 5). A measuring tape can be used to mark the outer edge of the  plot.  Figure 5 - laying out a hedgerow plot  HeEbee to me 2%  — — V— : 3s  If there is not a clear metre between the centre of the hedge and another linear feature, eg ditch, then the hedge should be relocated at the nearest permissable location.  All species should be recorded on the standard recording sheet and cover estimates made.  Permanent marking  Each plot should be permanently marked with a metal plate at the right hand end of the plot when you are facing it from the field - the location of the plate should be indicated on a sketch with distances from a marked feature, eg. gate.  STREAMSIDE PLOTS (S1 ~— $2; W1 - W3) Streamside plots 10xim (S1, S2) Location/Relocation  In the case of squares recorded in 1978, the original positions will be marked on the map - they should be relocated as closely as possible. If the stream or ditch is dry then it should still be recorded, but noted on the recording sheet.  If one or both stream plots are not marked but streams, rivers or ditches exist in the square, they should be added using the methodology developed in 1978 (para 6.2.4). However 2 plots should not be nearer than 10m to each other, so if there is not more than 20m of stream/ditch/river in the square, only one plot should be recorded.  In the case of squares which were not recorded in 1978, the position of these 2 plots should be located using the methodology developed in 1978, (see para 6.2.4). The plot should be on the side of the linear feature closest to the quadrat.  If the plot coincides with a Boundary plot, then it should be moved to the nearest permissable length of stream/river/ditch so that no part of the plot is within 10 metres of the Boundary plot.  Streams that have dried out in a temporary/seasonal drought, should be used if the usual presence of water has influenced the species composition of the streamside.  Laying out and recording  The position of the plots should be marked with a plate at the right end of the plot when you are facing it from the field (see Figure 6) - the location of the plate should be indicated on a sketch with distances from a marked feature, eg. gate. Figure 6 - laying out a Streamside plot  The waterside edge of the plot should be along what appears to be the normal highest point that water reaches (ie excepting flood situations). All species found within a 1 metre width from this edge should be recorded and marked on the standard recording form with a "1" in the "Q" column.  In addition to the 10m x 1m plot, a further linear plot of the same size should be recorded on the water side, to record species which are rooted or floating in the water (not rooted on the bank of the stream/river) - species in this additional plot should be recorded using the standard form but with a "2" in the "Q" column. If the waterway is less than 1m wide then record additional species but aiso make a note of the average width of the waterway over the ten metres.  Extra wet (ditch/stream/river) plots - 10xim - W1, W2, W3  If the existing stream plots (S1, S2) are within the area designated by IFE for the ‘freshwater sample’ (and satisfies the appropriate criteria) then this should be used as the freshwater sampling point.  However, if this is not the case, then the first priority in locating one of the 3 extra ‘wet’ linear plots, is that it should coincide with the site for recording the freshwater sample (which are marked on maps, usually as "W3"). If the plot marked on the IFE map coincides with a "S1" or "S2" plot, then the name should be changed on the IFE map.  If the site chosen for the IFE biota sample has to be moved, then the linear vegetation plot should be moved with it.  The other ‘wet’ plots should be used to ensure that different types of ditches/streams/rivers are sampled where they exist. If all types are not represented, then samples should be allocated according to the  $e vi.  total lengths of the different types present (ie the type with the longest length has most plots). If possible, the variation within more common types should be expressed in the choice of plots.  The following categories are recognised :  River or canalised river  Stream  Canal  Non-roadside ditch  Roadside ditch  (as defined for map codes 53 - 58)  Dry ditches should not be included. The first priority is to ensure that there is at least 1 plot in each category existing in the square, including the 2 original plots $1 & S2. The second priority is to include as much variation as possible so that lengths of stream with species assemblages not covered by the existing plots are sampled.  The plots should be located in the centre of that part of the ‘waterway’ type which lies within the square. If there is only one type of waterway then all 5 plots should be placed along its length, providing that it is long enough to put them more than 10m apart. The plots should not be put within 10m of each other.  The position of these plots must be marked with plates and sketched as for S1 & S2. The type of ditch/stream/river adjacent to the plot should be indicated on the recording sheet.  Aquatic species in the adjacent metre should be recorded in the same way as for S1/S2 plots.  ROADSIDE PLOTS (R1 ~— R2; V1 - V3) Roadside plots 10xim (V1, V2) Location/Relocation  In the case of squares recorded in 1978, the original positions will be marked on the map ~ they should be relocated as closely as possible. If one or both verges are not marked but road verges exist in the square, they should be added using the methodology developed in 1978 (para 6.2.4). However 2 plots should not be nearer than 10m to each other, so if there is not more than 20m of road verge in the square, only one plot should be recorded.  In the case of squares which were not recorded in 1978, the position of these 2 plots should be located using the methodology developed in 1978 (para 6.2.4).  Verge plots should not be located where the verge is less than Im wide; instead the nearest verge with a 1 metre width should be located.  Laying out and recording  The position of the plots should be marked with a plate at the right end of the plot when you are facing it from the field (see Figure 7) - the location of the plate should be indicated on a sketch with distances from a marked feature, eg. gate. As it may be necessary to move the plot to the other side of the road (because the first verge is not wide enough) it should be made clear which side of the road is recorded. (In such cases, the plate is still on the right hand side of the plot when viewed from the X plot).  The roadside edge of the plot should start at the interface between soil and tarmac, not where overhanging vegetation starts.  Figure 7 - laying out a Roadside plot  / FRO X PLOT / / / TOP EDGE oF VERGE / / F f ia / geet teen Fama me NE ON / Filer Ploy /  VS) COSA Bop ren TIT IT 7?  Where the verge is more than 2m wide (from the edge of the road, to 1m from the centre of the next feature, ie. hedge, wall, fence) then a supplementary verge plot should be recorded adjacent to the first to sample the vegetation between 1m and 2m from the roadside. However, only additional species should be recorded and a number ‘2’ recorded in the "Q" column of the standard recording sheet. If there are no additional species, then this should be noted accordingly.  Extra verge plots - 10xlm - V1, V2, V3 Three further verge plots should be used to ensure that different types of roads and tracks are sampled where they exist. The following categories are recognised :  i. ‘A’ and 'B’ roads including dual carriageways (red and brown)  ii. Yellow roads if tarmac  iii. Constructed tracks and non-tarmac roads  (motorways are excluded from this classification) The first priority is to ensure that there is at least 1 plot in each category of road present in the square, including the 2 original verge plots Rl & R2. The second priority is to include as much variation as  possible so that lengths of verge with species assemblages not covered by the existing plots are sampled. The plots should be located in the  38 6.2.4  centre of the verge type. If there is only one type of verge then all 5 plots will be on that verge, providing that it is long enough to put them more than 10m apart.  The position of these plots must be marked with plates and sketched as for R1 & R2.  The type of road or track adjacent to the plot should be indicated on the recording sheet. Additional species should be recorded from a second linear plot on wide verges, as for R1/R2 plots.  1978 Rules for locating linear plots The linear plots (2 each for hedgerows, streamsides and roadsides) arc: 10 x 1 m; they should be located as close as possible to the two larg«  quadrats (200m2) which are furthest apart (see Figure 8). They must then be marked on the map provided.  Figure 8 — location of linear tliots in 1977/78  On reaching the linear feature, from the 200m2 quadrat, the 10m plot is laid out to the left and the width is defined as follows:  Hedgerows: the 1m width extends out towards the field from the centre of the hedge.  Roadsides: the 1m width extends inwards from the edge of the road edge.  Streamsides: the 1m width extends landwards from the point where it appears that water reaches when the watercourse is full (but not flooded).  34 6.2.5  Only permanent water courses should be included; ditches may be included if they appear to be normally wet.  Where the nearest feature is ineligable (because it is not wide enough, or is confused by the presence of a different type of linear within its width) then a new location should be chosen at the nearest permissable position. Any changes should be noted and clearly marked on sketch maps.  Guidelines on species identification  Using the same criteria as were used in 1978, the following section gives some guidelines on species identification.  Surveyors are expected to record to the species level. However, there are certain species which are notoriously difficult to separate out from closely related examples of the same genus. It is therefore necessary, in order to remain consitant with previous surveys, to allow certain combinations to be recorded.  The combinations were determined on the basis of experience, where it is considered that unless good specimens are available it is not possible to identify the species accurately. A number of the species combinations have similar ecological amplitudes e.g. Cardamine hirsuta/flexuosa. The following are acceptable combinations:  Arctium sp  Betula sp  Callitriche sp.  Cardamine hirsuta/flexuosa Epilobium tetragonum/obscurum Small Euphorbia sp  Euphrasia sp  Hieracium sp (except pilosella) Juncus articulatus/acutiflorus Luzula multiflora/campestris Mentha sp  Myosotis sp  Poa trivialis/nemoralis Polygala serphyllifolia/vulgaris Quercus sp  Rhinanthus sp  Rosa sp (except R arvensis, R pimpinellifolia) Rumex conglomeratus/sanguineus Sagina sp  Taraxacum sp  Viola riviniana/reichenbachiana Viola hirta/odorata  Non suckering elms (U glabra) Suckering elms (U procera)  Only the following Bryophytes and Lichens should be recorded (with individual cover values).

Freshwater biota from standing water bodies (the NELUP sample)  The procedure for collecting freshwater biota samples from flowing waters (on behalf of the Institute of Freshwater Ecology) is fully described in a separate handbook.  The second freshwater sample is to be collected from static water on behalf of staff working within the NERC/ESRC Land Use Programme (NELUP) at Newcastle University. Although various biota will be sampled, the exercise is based on the collection of water beetles.  From each square, two samples should be taken from available standing waters, and preferably from those which are vegetated. The samples should be chosen from the following list of standing water locations and should be chosen, where possible, to reflect the two most characteristic water habitats of the square:  a) Lakes/Lochs: these are not ideal as they are usually affected by wave action leading to lack of surface vegetation and often have a bare substrate.  b) Ponds: these are ideal especially if partially or wholly vegetated and with a mud/silt substrate  c) Dried-up streams: pools of water which remain are good sampling points  d) Dried-up or stagnant ditches: good sampling points e) Calcareous flushes: £) Acid flushes:  g) Sphagnum bog: even if there appears to be no water present, a puddle can be formed by standing on the bog - beetles are likely to collect in such pools.  h) Vehicle tracks/ Animal prints: any depression in mud which has filled with water for a time will form a good site for sampling.  The positions of the sample points should be clearly marked on the same map as is used to indicate the IFE sample point. The sites should be marked as NEL1 and NEL2. A one-line description of each NELUP site should be written on the back of this sheet, giving a brief description of the size and type of feature which has been sampled.  Samples of biota should be taken using a sieve and placed in the tray provided. Each sample should involve a maximum of 10° minutes searching time. After removal of unwanted matter from the tray, the sample should be placed in the plastic bottle and formalyn added. A label should be placed in the bottle giving:  Lis Square number ii. date iii. mame of the surveyor.  The bottle should also be marked with the same information (using a black permanent marker pen) and wrapped in two plastic bags.  Arrangements should be made to transport bottles back to ITE Merlewood as soon as is possible.  PHOTOGRAPHY  Print films should be used to photograph every vegetation plot in order to show its general appearance and its position relevant to local landmarks or features.  The plot number (X3, V2 etc) should be written on the plastic board provided and should be placed in a prominent position at the edge of plot, preferably covering the position of the marker plate.  PROCEDURES SUBSEQUENT TO SURVEY  At the end of a day’s surveying, it is advisable to read through the data sheets and check that no feature has been omitted.  If absolutely essential, then the data may be transposed onto fresh maps and recording forms but this is inadvisable and should only be carried out in the event of damage or spoiling of the original map.  Arrangements should be made to transport FABs, and samples, back to ITE Stations as soon as possible.  Colin Barr May 1990 (Revised February 1991)

Field-based research ............................................................................................................................... 6  ANNEX - Examples of documentary evidence .................................................................................................. 7  1 Background  This Code was initially developed by a working group of representatives from the:  • Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)  • Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)  • Food Standards Agency (FSA), and  • Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).  It was subsequently endorsed by the:  • Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture and Rural Development  • Scottish Government, and  • Welsh Government (The UK Devolved Administrations).  The Code has also been endorsed by:  • Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)  • Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera)  • Forestry Commission (FC)  • Marine Management Organisation (MMO)  • Natural England (NE), and  • Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD).  The Code was launched in May 2003, and took effect from 1 June 2004. Defra and the  FSA initiated a joint audit programme in 2006 to determine whether research projects,  funded after 1 June 2004, were being carried out in accordance with the Code. The United  Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS), was commissioned to audit a sample of Defra /  FSA projects against the provisions of the Code.  The generic findings from the two year UKAS audit programme were disseminated  amongst QA managers and other interested parties, at a joint Defra / FSA workshop, held  in Reading in March 2009. The Code has subsequently been revised by Defra and the  FSA in light of both the audit findings and the workshop outputs, with input from BBSRC,  NERC and the UK Devolved Administrations.  The Code applies to all research funded by Defra, the FSA, NE, VMD, APHA, MMO, Fera,  FC, the UK Devolved Administrations, and to research funded by BBSRC and NERC in  their own Institutes. It is intended to apply to all types of research, but the overriding  2 principle is fitness of purpose and therefore the individual provisions should be read with  that in mind.  Principles behind the Code  Contractors funded by the above Funding Bodies are expected to be committed to:  • the quality of the research process (QP), and  • the quality of the science (QS).  QS addresses the aims of the project, its approaches, and the extraction of new  knowledge and understanding from the scientific work commissioned. QP by comparison,  underlies the research giving confidence the processes and procedures used to gather  and interpret the results of the research are appropriate, rigorous, repeatable and  auditable. Without QP, confidence in the research findings is much reduced.  The Funding Bodies wish to ensure their contractors are using “best scientific practice”  from the start of all research projects. Compliance with the Code should be driven from the  top of funded organisations.  The Funding Bodies have developed this Code of Practice to lay out a framework for the  proper conduct of research. It sets out the key aspects of QP and the importance of  making judgements on the appropriate precautions needed in every research activity. The  overriding principle is “fitness for purpose”. QP is also consistent with the requirement that  all research should be conducted diligently by researchers who are both competent and  adequately trained.  Compliance with the Code  For the FSA, Defra, NE, VMD, APHA, MMO, Fera, FC and the UK Devolved  Administrations, contractors will be expected to indicate acceptance of the Code when  submitting proposals to the Funding Body through completion of the relevant research  application.  Contractors are encouraged to discuss with the Funding Body any clauses in the Code  they consider inappropriate or non-applicable in the context of any proposed research  project(s). The Code, and records of the discussions if held, will become part of the Terms  and Conditions under which the research is funded. Additionally, the Funding Body may  conduct (or request from the Contractor as appropriate) a formal risk assessment on the  project(s) to identify where additional controls may be needed.  Contractors are responsible for ensuring projects are compliant with the JCoPR’s  provisions. Contractors are also responsible for ensuring all subcontractors are aware of,  and work in accordance with, the JCoPR’s provisions in respect of any project work they  carry out on behalf of the funding bodies.  For BBSRC- and NERC-funded work, acceptance of the Code should be provided  annually by the Institute Director.  3 Monitoring of compliance with the Code  Monitoring of compliance with the Code is necessary to ensure:  • Policies and managed processes exist to ensure compliance with the Code.  • The policies and processes (as required) are being applied consistently in practice  across the research organisation.  The Funding Bodies expect research organisations, where possible, will assure the quality  of their research processes by means of a formal system that is audited by an impartial  and competent third party against an appropriate internationally recognised standard that  is fit for purpose.  The Funding Bodies reserve the right to obtain evidence that a funded project is carried  out to the required standard (if deemed necessary), such as by conducting an independent  audit of a contractor’s research system. This premise underpinned the two year UKAS  audit programme, undertaken on behalf of Defra and the FSA, initiated in 2006.  Specific requirements of the Code  1. Responsibilities  The contractor organisation is responsible for the overall quality of research conducted  within it, including compliance with in-house research and management policies.  Managers, group leaders, and supervisors have a responsibility to maintain and promote a  climate of good scientific practice within the research teams, including a commitment to  the ongoing development of relevant scientific and technical skills.  The Principal Investigator or Project Leader is responsible for all work conducted in the  project, which includes that of all subcontractors. All staff and students should have clearly  defined and documented responsibilities in relation to the project and be aware of these  responsibilities.  2. Competence  All project personnel must be competent to perform the technical, scientific, and support  tasks required of them. Personnel undergoing training must be supervised at a level such  that the quality of the results is not compromised by the inexperience of the researcher.  Contractors should be able to provide documented evidence that personnel are capable of  completing the work required competently and safely. Training records should show  evidence that personnel are aware of their requirements to conform to the JCoPR’s  provisions.  4 3. Project planning  An appropriate level of risk assessment should be conducted to demonstrate awareness of  the key factors that will influence the success of the project and the ability to meet its  objectives.  There should be a clear, written project plan showing that these factors (including research  design, statistical methods, and others) have been considered and addressed. Project  plans must be agreed in collaboration with the Funding Body, taking account of the  requirements of ethical committees or the terms of project licences, if relevant.  Contractors should schedule regular reviews of their timetables and project plans to  monitor progress and make any necessary amendments. Significant amendments to the  plans, milestones or deliverables must be recorded and pre approved by the Funding  Body.  4. Quality Control  The contractor organisation should have planned processes in place to assure the quality  of the research undertaken by its scientists. Projects should be subjected to formal ‘fit-for- purpose’ reviews of an appropriate frequency.  The authorisation of outputs shall be as agreed by the Funding Body, and subject to senior  approval in the organisation, where appropriate. Errors identified after publication must be  notified to the Funding Body and agreed corrective action initiated at the earliest  opportunity.  Processes and procedures should be regularly reviewed as part of a policy of continual  improvement.  5. Health and Safety  All research must fully comply with the relevant Health and Safety regulatory requirements.  6. Handling of samples and materials  All samples and other experimental materials should be labelled clearly, accurately,  uniquely, and durably, and be retained for a period to be agreed with the Funding Body.  The storage and handling of the samples and materials should be clearly specified in the  project plan or proposal, and must be appropriate to their nature. If the storage conditions  are critical, they must be monitored and recorded.  Samples must be readily tracked through the stages of analysis or use, and have  designated disposal routes and dates.  5 7. Facilities and equipment  The working environment must be appropriate for safe operation of equipment,  maintenance of sample quality and integrity, and good working practices. Where special  facilities are used (e.g. fume cupboards) they must be regularly checked and maintained.  All equipment must be appropriate for the measurements to be made, calibrated at  appropriate interval and be in good working condition. If critical, there should be  contingency plans in case of power failure or other disruption. Contractors should ensure  there are standard operating procedures for all project critical equipment.  8. Documentation of procedures and methods  All the procedures and methods used in a research project must be documented, as part  of the contractor’s file records for the project. This includes analytical and statistical  procedures and the generation of a clear audit trail, including document and version  controls, linking secondary processed information to primary research data.  There must be a procedure for the validation of research methods as ‘fit for purpose’ and  modifications must be traceable through each stage of development of the method.  9. Research / work records  The contractor’s project records must be of sufficient quality and detail to present a  complete picture of the work performed, enabling it to be repeated if necessary.  The Project Leader must ensure the validity of the work by carrying out regular reviews of  the records of all project staff.  The location of all project records, including critical data, must be recorded. They must be  retained in a form that ensures their integrity and security, and prevents unauthorised  modification, for a period to be agreed with the Funding Body.  10. Field-based research  All field-based research must comply with all relevant environmental legislation, where  appropriate. Laboratories have a duty to manage any discharges and emissions to the  environment, such that any pollution risks are minimised. All provisions of the JCoPR, as  above, will also apply.  6 ANNEX - Examples of documentary evidence  QUALITY ISSUE  EVIDENCE REQUIRED  1.

Emissions of metals and air pollutants in the UK, 1750 – 2100 (1km x 1km) SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION Overview This dataset provides estimates of emissions for seven air pollutants (APs) (carbon monoxide [CO], ammonia [NH3], oxides of nitrogen [NOx], particulate matter < 2.5µm [PM2.5], particulate matter < 10µm [PM10], sulphur dioxide [SO2] & non-methane volatile organic compounds [NMVOCs]) and five metals (cadmium [Cd], copper [Cu], nickel [Ni], lead [Pb] & zinc [Zn]) in the UK from 1750 to 2100, on a 1km x 1km spatial resolution. Emissions are reported using the 11 Selected Nomenclature for Air Pollution sectors (SNAP, European Environment Agency, 2019), the current system used within the UK National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI, NAEI 2021). Data are a combination of three temporal periods, including: historical research, contemporary inventories and future scenario modelling.  Methods Historical emissions (1750 – 1960): Emissions estimates for the historical period prior to 1970 were based on literature research for key-contributory sectors, fuels and processes. The UK Inventory estimates emissions from a large variety of detailed sources which could not be reproduced historically, so prioritisation was based upon the contribution of important fuels and processes to total UK emissions in the contemporary reporting era (1970-2018). Combustion of fuels and process activities were grouped by activity sectors (e.g. energy generation, metal production, road transportation) which were then researched and modelled for the full historical time series. Statistical sources - including government records, industrial records, books, mining ledgers and more - formed the basis from which emissions estimates were made.  Source strengths, i.e. the strength of emission per unit fuel burnt or unit of process undertaken, referred to as the emission factor (EF), were adjusted for a number of fuel combustion activities – particularly with regards to coal, coke and oil combustion – in an attempt to reflect changes in industrial practices through time. For APs, reported values from literature were used for pollutants/activities where found and applied to a range of applicable years (e.g. WebFIRE, EPA, 2021; Winijkul et al., 2016). Where no suitable EF was found for AP activities pre-1970, the earliest recorded EF from the UK NAEI was used back to 1750. Where different EFs were used prior to 1970, an S-shaped curve was developed between the earliest year for that EF and 1970 (Bond et al., 2007), in an attempt to represent technology development and diffusion. For metals from fuel combustion prior to 1970, a methodology linked to the metal content of coal/oil and its subsequent enrichment in ash was used (Nalbandian, 2012), which meant that any change to EFs for particulate matter would also effect the amount of metal emitted from that source.  Emissions were spatially distributed onto a variety of appropriate proxy datasets, such as population surfaces, census employment records, land use (particularly for agricultural emissions, see Levy et al., 2018), proximity to features such as water or roads, digitised data etc. This was done on a 1km x 1km resolution, using the OSGB projection, on the 11 SNAP sectors used in the UK inventory to ensure consistency in the time series. Spatial information for Northern Ireland was difficult to find prior to 1950 and so spatial proxies in NI were statistically estimated using a random forest model, incorporating known UK information and GB-only proxy information.  Contemporary emissions (1970 – 2018): Emissions estimates for the contemporary period are taken directly from the UK emissions inventory (NAEI 2021, e.g. Garland et al., 2022), which estimates emissions of air pollutants (APs) and metals from 1970 to present day (aside from NH3, which begins in 1980). For APs, the same spatial distribution - that of 2018 - is used back to 2000 for diffuse emissions from each SNAP sector and is combined with year-specific point source information back to 2000. For APs from 1970 to 1995, SNAP sector totals (i.e. diffuse + point emissions) are scaled in line with UK reported totals. For metals, no such point source information was available for the UK and so combined diffuse and point emission surfaces for each SNAP for 2018 were scaled by reported UK totals back to 1970. For NH3, the 1970 distribution comes from the historical emissions modelling.  Future emissions (2040 – 2100): Emissions for five future scenarios, across three points in time (2040, 2070 & 2100), were estimated using UK-specific Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) (Pedde et al., 2021). A collection of eighteen key indicator variables were developed that could be adjusted in line with the socioeconomic narratives and matched to each SNAP sector. Indicator variables – including population, fertiliser usage, transport usage and livestock numbers – were given semi-quantitative trend lines into the future based on the specific scenario narrative, via stakeholder engagement workshops. These trend lines were converted to scaling factors to apply to UK emissions reported for 2018. For NH3, EFs from Defra’s Scenario Modelling Tool (for the year 2018) were adjusted to align with SSP projections. Land use inputs used for distributing diffuse emission sources were estimated using land use outputs from the CRAFTY-GB model. Nature and Units of Recorded Values All emissions values are given as tonnes of pollutant per km2 per annum (t km-2 a-1), for every 1km x 1km cell. No-data values are given as NA.  Quality Control Emissions totals from 1970 to 2018 are directly linked to the UK’s National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI, 2021) and the QAQC methods used therein.  The emissions were used in an atmospheric chemistry transport model. Visual mapping checks were performed for the whole of the UK for the deposition of various pollutants. Time series of atmospheric surface concentrations of heavy metals were compared with observations where available. For a selected year (2018) a full QA/QC was performed for multiple species. Details of data structure Files are names with the following convention: “Sxx_p_emis_SSPi_y_t_km2.tif”.

All pollutants for 2040/2070/2100 are modelled for 5 scenarios (SSPs), while all data from 1750 to 2018 are on one timeline only and represented by nomenclature ‘SSP0’, for filename continuity. Where no emissions are modelled, no file is present.

Distributed potential recharge projections for the UK, based on UK Climate Projections 2018 (UKCP18) data, from the Enhanced Future Flows and Groundwater (eFLaG) project Supporting Documentation Overview This dataset comprises 2km gridded daily projections of potential groundwater recharge from 1981 to 2080 covering mainland Great Britain. They are simulated using the British Geological Survey (BGS) distributed groundwater recharge model (ZOODRM, Mansour and Hughes, 2004) driven with bias-corrected ‘Regional’ (RCM) 12km UKCP18 climate projections (Murphy et al. 2019). The dataset also includes corresponding gridded observation-driven time series of potential groundwater recharge simulations covering 1962 to 2018. These data represent the raw (un-regionalised) groundwater recharge simulations that were used to derive area-averaged groundwater recharge estimates at the groundwater-body scale (available here: https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/documents/1bb90673-ad37-4679-90b9-0126109639a9).  The eFLaG project was funded by the Met Office led component of the Strategic Priorities Fund Climate Resilience Programme under contract P107493 (CR19_4 UK Climate Resilience) and includes a partnership of research scientists at the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH), BGS and HR Wallingford. The dataset described here was created by the BGS in collaboration with UKCEH.   Data generation methods A brief description of the data generation methods are provided here. For more detail, the reader is advised to read the accompanying scientific journal article here: https://essd.copernicus.org/preprints/essd-2022-40/.  ZOODRM ZOODRM is a distributed recharge model originally developed to estimate recharge values to drive groundwater simulators (Mansour and Hughes, 2004). It is applied over the British mainland using a 2km×2km square grid. The FAO Drainage and Irrigation Paper 56 (FAO, 1988) approach, modified by Griffiths et al. (2006), is used to calculate potential recharge. This method removes actual evaporation and soil moisture deficit from rainfall and calculates potential recharge as a fraction of the excess water using a runoff coefficient value. The model has been used in the past to assess changes in 21st century seasonal recharge across river basin districts and groundwater bodies in the UK based on the FFGWL climate change projections (Hughes et al. 2021). UKCP18 Data Processing and Bias Correction The UKCP18 regional projections created by the Met Office were created using perturbed-parameter runs of the Hadley Centre global climate model (GCM) and RCMs (HadGEM3-GC3.05 and HadREM3-GA705 respectively). These provide a set of 12 high-resolution (12km) spatially-consistent climate projections over the UK, covering the period December 1980 to November 2080. The UKCP18 outputs were processed to provide 1km gridded daily time series of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (PE). For ZOODRM, these were resampled to 2 km to ensure consistency with the model resolution. The precipitation data were bias-corrected using monthly-mean bias correction. Nature and units of recorded values All recharge model outputs are reported in units of mm per day on a regular cartesian 2 km grid with British national grid coordinates in units of meters. Quality control A brief description of the quality control methods are provided here. For more detail, the reader is advised to read the accompanying scientific journal article here: https://essd.copernicus.org/preprints/essd-2022-40/. A two-stage model calibration/evaluation was undertaken to:  Evaluation when driven with baseline observed climate data Evaluation when driven with baseline climate model data. Stage 1 used a range of statistics to assess the performance of model simulations driven by observed climate data against observations of river flow. ZOODRM was evaluated for its ability to capture catchment water balances using observations of mean monthly river flows from the UK National River Flow Archive (https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/). Stage 2 appraised the performance of ZOODRM when driven by the climate model outputs:  that is, compared the climate model and observation-driven recharge simulations over a common baseline time period (1989-2018). Details of data structure The data are stored as NetCDF files. All files use the same 2 km spatial gridding with British National Grid coordinates and with times specified as “days since 1950-01-01”. For ease of use, the data are split across multiple files, each representing a continuous 5-year time slice from the observation-driven simulation or one of the RCM-driven simulations. Following Hannaford et al. 2022 these are referred to as the simobs and simrcm simulations respectively. Although the data structure is similar for both, there are some differences which are highlighted below. References FAO. (1998).

www.countrysidesurvey.org.uk UK Results from 2007 Countryside Survey: Countryside Survey: UK Results from 2007     CHAPTER 1 • Countryside Survey Methodology Foreword by Rt. Hon. Hilary Benn, M.P.  Secretary of State for Environment,  Food and Rural Aff airs The countryside lies  at the heart of our  prosperity, our health  and our well-being.  It provides us with  food and water, it helps  deal with ﬂ ooding and  store carbon, and it  enriches our lives. Now, more than ever, we cannot  aff ord to take the countryside  for granted. Faced with new  pressures we must rebalance  our relationship with the natural world. We must ensure that the  landscapes, wildlife and ecosystems that provide us with the  essentials of life are not only looked after but are improved for  future generations. The health of the countryside is increasingly aff ected by climate  change, pollution and the demand for land. These powerful,  constantly shifting forces threaten the beneﬁ ts that the natural  world provides. So in responding it is vital that we improve our  understanding of their impact. The UK Countryside Survey helps us to do that. It provides the  hard scientiﬁ c evidence that we need to build a clear picture of the  plants, habitats, soils and watercourses which determine the health  of the countryside as a whole. I will be studying the ﬁ ndings of this  report very carefully. Carrying out a national survey on this scale is an impressive  undertaking and I am greatly indebted to the team of research  scientists and surveyors who worked through the exceptionally  wet summer of 2007 to make it happen. I would like to acknowledge  the support of the many land owners and managers throughout  the country who gave permission for the survey to take place.  The project was also made possible by the relationship between the  Natural Environment Research Council and the other government  partners representing all the devolved administrations and relevant  agencies across the UK. Hilary Benn Foreword by Professor Alan Thorpe,  Chief Executive, Natural Environment  Research Council The issue of the  changing ecology of  the UK countryside is of  growing scientiﬁ c and  political importance,  driven by concerns  about land use changes,  climate change,  increased ﬂ ood risks  and sustainable  energy resources. The UK Countryside Surveys  bring together the policy and  scientiﬁ c communities, and provide the basis to deal with a great  number of scientiﬁ c issues. They off er a unique way to monitor  the changes in the environment’s ecosystems brought about by  our constant and varied demands on land and water resources, and  by the impacts of climate change and air pollution. They analyse  the relationships between soils, vegetation and water quality and  identify when and how these aff ect biodiversity. We now have a remarkably detailed 30 year record of where  environmental changes have occurred. This is vital scientiﬁ c  evidence for policy makers and all those with interests in  sustainable land management. The results from these surveys  help to answer questions about why the changes have happened,  and decide what policy decisions are needed to manage future  change. They will be an invaluable data source for other strategic  programmes, such as the ‘Living With Environmental Change’  partnership. The Natural Environment Research Council is very proud to  support this important scientiﬁ c initiative, which addresses the  environmental, social and economic challenges of providing a  sustainable countryside for the UK.

The  completion of the survey has only been made possible by  the support and advice of many dedicated individuals from  these and other organisations who provided their time and  valuable advice to the project board, the project steering  group, and the project advisory groups. The project Partners would like to thank all the landowners,  farmers, and other land managers who gave permission for  the ﬁ eld surveyors to collect data and samples from their  land. Without such cooperation, scientiﬁ c ﬁ eld studies like  Countryside Survey would not be possible. Countryside Survey is conducted by NERC’s Centre for  Ecology & Hydrology (CEH). The Partners would like to  thank all those who contributed to the successful delivery  of this report (listed below).

Countryside Survey: UK Results from 2007     CHAPTER 1 • Countryside Survey Methodology Summary This chapter describes the rationale and methods that have  been used to collect the data for Countryside Survey in 2007  and in the preceding Surveys. Countryside Survey is made up of two main parts:   a)  the Field Survey (reported here) focuses on habitats,  vegetation, soils (0-15 cm) and freshwater; and   b)  the Land Cover Map (which will be published in 2009)  is a digital map using satellite data from space. The Field Survey covered a total of 591 1km x 1km sample  squares spread across England, Scotland and Wales,  representative of the variations in the climate and geology of  the three countries. Data are also included where appropriate,  from a separate survey of 0.5km x 0.5km squares undertaken  in Northern Ireland. The two surveys are undertaken  separately but the results are brought together where possible  in this report for the UK. Areas of habitat were mapped within each square and more  detailed samples were made of vegetation in a series of  plots. The plots varied in size depending on the feature being  sampled, but in all plots the species of plant present and  the percentage of the area they covered were recorded. Soil  (0-15cm) samples were also collected from ﬁ ve plots in each  square, and a stream and a pond were also sampled in many of  the squares. The data collected enables estimates of:   •  the area of habitats and the change in  area of habitats;   •  the changing condition of vegetation;   •  the pH, carbon concentration and bulk density  of soils (0-15cm); and   • the changing condition of freshwaters and ponds. 1.  Countryside Survey Methodology  Surveyor at work, Scotland• © NERC 2 Countryside Survey: UK Results from 2007     CHAPTER 1 • Countryside Survey Methodology 1.1  Introduction Countryside Survey (CS) is made up of two main parts: the Field  Survey which is the focus of this report and the Land Cover Map,  a survey using satellite data from space to create a digital map,  which will be published in 2009. The ﬁ rst CS was carried out in 1978, followed by Surveys in 1984,  1990, 19981 and 2007, increasing the long-term series of data  each time. With the completion of the 2007 Survey, the whole CS  data set now provides information about changes in the British  countryside over a 30-year period and, by combining with data from  NICS, change in the UK countryside between 1998 and 2007.  Since the introduction of the Broad Habitat classiﬁ cation system  in 1998, CS data have been used to provide information on  progress against the UK Biodiversity Action Plan for Broad Habitats  and for some Priority Habitats. Since 1990, CS has been used  with other statistics to help inform policy makers on changes in  the rural environment. The Broad Habitat Classiﬁ cation “It is vital to be able to identify and record species and  ecological communities of interest that are under threat  so that they can be related to a legal framework to ensure  their protection. Species and habitat classiﬁ cation provides  a language through which data can be communicated at a  national and international level. The Broad Habitat classiﬁ cation was developed as a part of  the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. The list of Broad Habitats  that was published in the UK Steering Group Report in 1995  has been subject to a recent review to ensure that the  whole of the land surface of the UK and the surrounding  sea, to the edge of the continental shelf, is covered. This has  resulted in a revised list of 27 Broad Habitats. The Broad  Habitats are the framework through which the Government is  committed to meet its obligations for monitoring in the wider  countryside…” (The Joint Nature Conservation Committee –  www.jncc.gov.uk/page-1425) The terrestrial Broad Habitats covered by  Countryside Survey are: • Broadleaved, Mixed and Yew Woodland • Coniferous Woodland  • Boundary and Linear Features • Arable and Horticultural Land  • Improved Grassland • Neutral Grassland  • Calcareous Grassland • Acid Grassland  • Bracken  • Dwarf Shrub Heath • Fen, Marsh and Swamp  • Bog  • Inland Rock  • Montane • Standing Open Waters and Canals  • Rivers and Streams • Littoral Sediment  • Littoral Rock • Supra-littoral Sediment  • Supra-littoral Rock   • Built-up and Gardens Priority Habitats Priority Habitats are those which have been identiﬁ ed in the  UK Biodiversity Action Plan as being at risk: such as those  with a high rate of decline; those that are functionally critical;  and those which are important for Priority Species. Priority Habitats are all sub-classiﬁ cations within one or  more of the Broad Habitats. In the UK there are currently 65  Priority Habitats. Countryside Survey is able to produce preliminary  statistics for some Priority Habitats listed below,  see the relevant chapter.

It provides national and regional  estimates of the extent of the diff erent Broad Habitats found in the  countryside (Box 1.1) and in 2007, for the ﬁ rst time, some Priority  Habitats. The Field Survey describes the character and condition  of the diff erent vegetation types associated with these Broad and  Priority Habitats, including both land and freshwater habitats. It  also provides estimates of the extent and condition of important  landscape features such as hedges, walls, ponds and trees. Some habitats have been identiﬁ ed as a priority for conservation  in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) and are known as Priority  Habitats (Box 1.1), and are assessed on a regular basis. As CS  represents an unbiased sample of the UK countryside and these  Priority Habitats are generally uncommon and/or localised, they  are generally not well represented within the CS e.g. Reedbed.  The results for a limited number of Priority Habitats (Box 1.1) are  presented in this report. They represent national estimates based  on a sample and should be used in conjunction with estimates  published by the UK BAP. Some CS estimates are very similar to  UK BAP while others diff er markedly. Neither can be considered  deﬁ nitive at present and will be further investigated. The CS  estimate for Hedgerows, Ponds and the condition of Arable  Field Margins represent the only national ﬁ gures for these  Priority Habitats. The recording framework for Broad Habitats within CS makes it  possible to report on both the area and the change in area for Broad  and Priority Habitats, using the data from the 1990, 1998 and  2007 Countryside Surveys. A modiﬁ ed coding system for habitat  mapping was introduced in 1998 to enable reporting on Broad and  Priority Habitats. The modiﬁ ed system has backwards compatibility  to 1990 for most Broad Habitats, and for some there is backwards  compatibility to 1984. The system also provides backwards  compatibility to 1990 for some Priority Habitats. Similarly, the  methods of recording linear features have been reﬁ ned over time  and so where there has been consistency of recording over time,  the length of linear landscape features and the numbers of point  features including trees and ponds (and changes in those lengths  and numbers) can be reported. The condition of the vegetation included in each mapped area  of Broad Habitats can also be reported for the 1990, 1998 and  2007 Countryside Surveys. This is because the position of each  vegetation plot is known and so the species data recorded in each  plot can be referenced to a Broad Habitat. As Broad Habitats were  not mapped in 1978, plots cannot be allocated to Broad habitats for  that year. Instead the vegetation data from the plots are analysed  using the classiﬁ cation by Aggregate Classes (ACs), which can be  applied consistently across all years. ACs are the vegetation types produced from a quantitative  hierarchical classiﬁ cation of the diff erent species found in sample  plots, based on a statistical analysis of the data2. The eight ACs  used for assessing vegetation condition are listed in Table 1.1.  A Broad Habitat may be characterised by a particular AC (e.g. the  AC Fertile Grassland ﬁ ts well within the Improved Grassland Broad  Habitat), whilst other Broad Habitats contain a mixture of diff erent  ACs (e.g. Acid Grassland Broad Habitat contains both the ACs of  Infertile Grassland and Moorland Grass Mosaics). Assessments of the condition of linear features are conﬁ ned largely  to more recent Countryside Surveys, in particular 1998 and 2007.  Table 1.1: The Aggregate Classes (ACs) used for assessment of  vegetation condition in Countryside Surveys from 1978 to 2007  (see Chapters 2 and 10). Aggregate Class (AC) Description AC1 Crops and Weeds Weedy communities of cultivated  and disturbed ground, including  species-poor arable and  horticultural crops. AC2 Tall Grass and Herb Less intensively managed tall  herbaceous vegetation typical  of ﬁ eld edges, roadside verges,  streamsides and hedge bottoms. AC3 Fertile Grassland Agriculturally improved or semi- improved grassland. Often  intensively managed agricultural  swards with moderate to high  abundance of perennial rye grass. AC4 Infertile Grassland Less-productive, unimproved and  often species rich grasslands in a  wide range of wet to dry and acid to  basic situations. AC5 Lowland Wooded Vegetation dominated by shrubs  and trees in neutral or basic  situations, generally in lowland  Britain. Includes many hedgerows. AC6 Upland Wooded Vegetation of broadleaved and  conifer woodland often in more  acidic situations, generally in  upland Britain. AC7 Moorland Grass Mosaics Extensive, often unenclosed  and sheep grazed hill pastures  throughout Britain. AC8 Heath and Bog Vegetation dominated by heathers.  Includes drier heaths as well as bog.  Mostly in the uplands. 2 Bunce et al (1999). Vegetation of the British Countryside. ECOFACT Volume 1.

CS uses a sample- based approach, to collect information at the level of detail required  for national reporting3. It is important to remember that the results  of CS are therefore calculated estimates and not absolute numbers  derived from a complete coverage of the country. The sampling strategy used for CS is based on a rigorous, statistical  approach. Great Britain was stratiﬁ ed ﬁ rst into Land Classes4 based  on the major environmental gradients across the countryside.  This permitted the sample to be structured to give reliable national  statistics and also ensured that the sample is representative of the  range of diff erent environments found in Great Britain (England,  Scotland and Wales). A similar approach was used within the  Northern Ireland Countryside Survey (NICS) (see Section 1.6). The sample consists of a set of ‘sample squares’ measuring  1km x 1km, selected randomly from the Ordnance Survey grid within  the various Land Classes (Fig. 1.1). Altogether, 591 sample squares  were surveyed in 2007; 289 were in England, 107 in Wales, and  195 in Scotland. Suffi  cient sample squares were selected from each  geographical region, to enable reliable statistical reporting for  Great Britain as a whole and for each separate country. Data from  the NICS (based on 288 squares, 0.5km x 0.5km, see Section 1.6)  are also added to provide estimates for the UK. As far as possible, the same squares are sampled each time CS is  repeated, so the vast majority of the sample squares visited in 1978  were also visited subsequently in 1984, 1990, 1998 and 2007.  Each successive CS has included greater numbers of sample squares  (Table 1.2). The estimates of change presented in this report use  a statistical modelling technique to infer missing values so that  changes between each year of the survey can be made using  the maximum data available (see Annex 5 to this Report at  www.countrysidesurvey.org.uk). 3 Bunce, R.G.H., Shaw, M.W.

Sample square resurveyed New sample square in 2007 England, Wales and Scotland  are divided into ‘land classes’,  according to the major  environmental gradients found  at national scales. These ‘land classes’ are used  to identify a stratiﬁ ed random  sample of the 1km x 1km grid  squares across Great Britain. Within each 1km x 1km sample  square, details of the habitats  and landscape features are  recorded together with change  since the last survey.  Figure 1.1: A) The 32 ITE Land Classes used to stratify Great Britain for selection of the random 1km squares visited in Countryside Survey.  B) Countryside Survey 1km x 1km sample squares in 2007. 5 Countryside Survey: UK Results from 2007     CHAPTER 1 • Countryside Survey Methodology CS is essentially a sample-based study of the rural environment,  which includes countryside around towns, cultivated land and  grassland, and more remote areas including moorlands, mountains  and islands. The sample is statistically representative of conditions  in the wider countryside, excluding only urban and sea areas.  As only land above the High Water Mark is covered, estimates of  the stock and change of intertidal habitats may be lower than other  national estimates. Squares containing more than 75% of developed  land or more than 90% of sea were not included in the Field Survey.  If a surveyed sample square subsequently changed so that more  than 75% of its area was developed, it was surveyed once more to  give the area of Broad and Priority Habitats being lost to developed  land. The square was then replaced by a new square in subsequent  Countryside Surveys. In 2007 a single headwater stream was surveyed in those sample  squares that contained one or more such streams (373 squares).  Data on various aspects of within-channel and adjacent habitat  condition were collected. Likewise, in 2007, one pond was surveyed  in (262) sample squares in which one or more ponds were found,  although not necessarily with a headwater stream. Data on the  condition of ponds were not collected in previous Countryside  Surveys, but in 1996 a separate survey of lowland ponds (see  Section 1.4.4) used the same sampling framework. It has been  possible to analyse change between 1996 and 2007 for this sub- set of ponds. Four soil (0-15cm) samples were collected from each of ﬁ ve  random locations (i.e. Main Plots) within each sample square.  The exact sampling points varied between survey years to avoid  both disturbance to the plot and sampling soil disturbed in previous  Countryside Surveys. In 2007 soil (0-15cm) was collected from all  sample squares, in 1978 and 1998 soil was collected only from the  squares surveyed in 1978. 1.4  Data collection The ﬁ eld survey was carried out by teams of botanical and  freshwater surveyors, after they had undergone an intensive four- week training course to ensure high standards and consistency of  methodology, identiﬁ cation and recording across CS. In 2007, new electronic data capture methods were developed for  and used in CS for the ﬁ rst time. The move from mapping on paper  (as in all preceding Countryside Surveys) to electronic methods  created greater effi  ciency in terms of data entry and also eliminated  a signiﬁ cant potential source of error. Improvements to data quality  also resulted from: the inclusion of mandatory data entry ﬁ elds for  each area or feature; a mask to assess completeness of data entry  electronically; and the ability to validate changes made to mapped  data whilst in the ﬁ eld. Mapping was carried out using a bespoke Geographical Information  System (GIS) program developed by the Centre for Ecology and  Hydrology (CEH) in conjunction with ESRI UK and in co-operation  with the Forestry Commission. The software was mounted on  Itronix® Duo-Touch lap-tops designed for work in rugged conditions.  These machines proved to be durable and coped well with the  demanding conditions in the ﬁ eld. Increased computing power and software developments have  enabled data from the whole sequence of Countryside Surveys  to be placed in a single geographically referenced database.  This database incorporates and links the mapped data, vegetation  plot data, soil collection points and the freshwater survey data,  facilitating analysis and data access for all potential users The surveyors were able to regularly download and upload data for  each sample location at regular intervals, through a web-based data  management system.  Table 1.2: Number of squares surveyed in each country of  Great Britain in successive Countryside Surveys.  Surveyors at work, Scotland • © NERC Country 1978 1984 1990 1998 2007 England 126 187 264 302 289 Wales 22 32 47 64 107 Scotland 108 163 195 203 195 Total 256 382 506 569 591 6 Countryside Survey: UK Results from 2007     CHAPTER 1 • Countryside Survey Methodology 1.4.1 Habitat and landscape feature mapping The habitats in the whole of each sample square were mapped,  providing data required to estimate the areas and changes in areas  of Broad and Priority Habitats, and the lengths and numbers of  landscape features (see Fig. 1.2). All Broad and Priority Habitats  and features were mapped (urban areas and agricultural curtilage  were excluded) using a minimum mappable area of 400m2  (20m x 20m through to 80m x 5m) and, for linear features, a  minimum mappable length of 20m. For squares mapped for the ﬁ rst  time in 2007 the surveyors started with Ordnance Survey linework  without any habitat information; for repeat squares mapping was  based on recording change to the maps produced in 1998, with  further reference to the maps produced in 1990 where helpful. Broad and Priority Habitats were identiﬁ ed using a key developed in  1998 for CS 2000 and updated with improvements between 2001  and 2006, utilising advice from many experts on UK BAP deﬁ nitions.  The key is available in Annex 2. Each mapped area of Broad or Priority Habitat forms a polygon on  the map of the square (Fig. 1.3). The surveyors entered information  about each mapped polygon, including land-use (crop, grazing  animals etc.) and at least the two most common species. When  surveyors encountered a habitat in 2007 that was diff erent to that  mapped in 1998, they were asked to make (and record) a judgement  as to whether a real change had occurred or whether the apparent  change was a result of the wrong habitat being allocated in 1998.  This approach was adopted to replace the system used in 1998  where surveyors recorded codes on maps (not related exactly to  Broad Habitats) that were subsequently allocated to Broad Habitats  some months later in the laboratory. In 1998 it was diffi  cult in some  instances for the digitisers to determine whether changes were real  or mapping error. Similarly surveyors were asked to validate 1998  data on other mapped features by recording their judgement as to  whether the features had been correctly recorded earlier on the  maps. The system in 2007 put the onus on the surveyors in the  ﬁ eld to remove any error caused by interpretation in the laboratory. Linear features were classiﬁ ed using a key developed for CS in  2005-2006. Of these, ‘Woody Linear Features’, which includes  hedges, remnant hedges, and lines of trees, were classiﬁ ed using a  key developed in consultation with the Hedgerow Steering Group of  the UK BAP.  Figure 1.2: Data gathered from a typical Countryside Survey sample square. 7 Soils: Samples were taken  from 5 of the plots in  each square. A range of  characteristics have been  analysed such as pH and  organic matter. Freshwater features: Rivers, streams, lakes and  ponds. The largest river or  stream in the square was  sampled and surveyed  along a 500m length.  One pond in each square  was surveyed in detail. Linear features: Walls, hedges, fences, roads, railways and  other transport features. Vegetation plots: Up to 67 plots were  located in each 1 km  square in diff erent  landscape situations.  Details of the diff erent  types of plot are listed  in Table 1.3. Land cover: Land cover was mapped using a series of  detailed codes e.g. acid grassland. Land use: e.g. commercial or  recreational woodland,  grazing for beef cattle  or sheep. Countryside Survey: UK Results from 2007     CHAPTER 1 • Countryside Survey Methodology 1.4.2 Vegetation sampling plots More detailed information about the composition of vegetation  (presence and percentage cover of vascular plant species) within  each of the sample squares was collected using a series of smaller  vegetation sampling plots. Various types of plot were employed and  on average 30 plots were completed in each sample square. Main Plots were located at pre-selected random points within the  sample square to provide an unbiased sample of widespread and  common habitat types in the open countryside (ﬁ elds, woods,  heaths and moors). Other, smaller plots were positioned randomly  by surveyors within areas targeted for their botanical interest.  These were often semi-natural habitats missed by Main Plots or in  relation to particular landscape features in the sample squares, and  so produced an unbiased sample of these habitats and features.  Further plots were located within unenclosed land in 1998 to  measure habitat condition. The vegetation sample plot data were entered electronically in  the ﬁ eld using CEH software, on the same laptops as used for the  mapping exercise. The data ﬁ elds on the electronic recording  forms were almost identical to those collected on paper forms  used since 1978. The diff erent plot types used, their names and the numbers  recorded in each CS square are described in Table 1.3 (for detailed  methodology see Annex 3). To analyse change, it is important to relocate the same sampling  plots in successive surveys. In previous Countryside Surveys sample  plot location was recorded on paper forms and by taking at least  two photographs. In 1998 a GPS was used in some remote squares.  In 2007 plot location was carefully recorded on the laptops using  the in-built GPS (where a GPS signal was available) and also on paper  and by photograph, to enable surveyors in subsequent surveys to  relocate them. Although some of the vegetation sampling plots  that were sampled in 2007 were new, most had been surveyed  in 1998 and in 1990 and some of them had records going back to  1978. All vegetation sampling plots can be regarded as ﬁ xed in  space. Vegetation sampling plot data provide: insights into the state  or condition of the Broad and Priority Habitats in which it occurs;  changes in the plots over time (Fig. 1.3); and overall vegetation  change (see Box 1.3 at the end of this chapter for the measures  analysed). The ACs (Table 1.1) are used to group species within the  diff erent Broad and Priority Habitats (Box 1.1).  Figure 1.3: Recording detailed changes in habitats and species composition in a Countryside Survey sample square. 2 1 3 A C B 2 1 3 D B A C 2 1 3 A C B 2 1 3 D A C B 1984 1990 2007 1998 8 The relationship between mapped land cover and vegetation plot data for assessing change in a 1km square. Example: In 1984 there were three Habitats A, B and C. By 1990 Habitat C had been replaced by more of Habitat B and the wall between  them removed. In 1998 a new block of Habitat D had been created in the north-east corner and by 2007 part of Habitat C had been recreated.  Plots were located in the habitats to sample vegetation in detail (for simplicity only three plots are shown in this ﬁ gure).  Plot 1 was on a boundary and this would have shown any changes to the boundary caused by the change of habitat neighbouring the plot.  Plot 2 was in Habitat B and was unlikely to change much, whereas Plot 3 is likely to have changed considerably as the habitat in which it was  sited changed between 1984 and 1990 and again between 1998 and 2007. Countryside Survey: UK Results from 2007     CHAPTER 1 • Countryside Survey Methodology 1.4.3 Soil (0-15cm) sampling As part of the 1978 CS, soil samples from the top 0-15cm were  collected 15cm south of the southern corner of the ﬁ ve Main Plots  in a sample of 256 1km x 1km squares (see Table 1.3). Samples  from later Countryside Surveys were collected from the other  corners resulting in soil sample locations approximately 2 to 3m  apart between Countryside Surveys. These plots were re-sampled  in 1998, whilst in 2007 soils were collected in all 591 x 1km squares,  from the western corner of Main Plots. The soil (0-15cm) samples  enable changes in several key soil characteristics to be studied,  including pH, soil (0-15cm) carbon and nitrogen concentration, a  measure of available phosphorus, heavy metal concentrations and  soil biota. In addition, measurements of potentially mineralisable  nitrogen and bulk density were made for the ﬁ rst time. In this  Report the results from the analysis of changes in soil (0-15cm) pH  (acidity) and soil (0-15cm) carbon concentration are presented along  with the 2007 measurements of bulk density. A more detailed Soils  Report will be published in 2009. Three soil samples only were collected from each Main Plot from the  top 15cm of the soil proﬁ le and a fourth, for the invertebrate sample  from the top 8cm only. In 1998 and 2007 this was carried out using  a plastic corer hammered into the soil and then pulled out with the  sample intact. In 1978, a soil pit was dug and soil was collected from  the top 15 cm of the proﬁ le in the side of the pit. In all three years,  loose vegetation and fresh litter were cleared from the soil surface  before the sample was taken. Soil (0-15cm) pH value: This is a measure of the acidity of the  soil that uses a logarithmic scale of hydrogen ion concentration,  with lower pH values being more acid than higher values.  For soil, a pH from 5.5 to 6.5 is considered neutral. Soil pH varies  by soil type and is inﬂ uenced by multiple factors including land  use, underlying geology, interaction with overlying vegetation  and its decomposition, and also by atmospheric deposition. Soil (0-15cm) carbon concentration: This is the concentration of  carbon in the top 15cm of the soil, expressed on a per unit weight  basis (grams of carbon per kilogram of soil, or g C/kg.). It is estimated  from the measurement of ‘loss on ignition’, using the standard  conversion factor of 0.5.

Headwater streams: In 2007 a selected stream and its  associated bank-side areas (the ‘riparian’ zone) were surveyed in  373 of the 591 squares surveyed. In the 1990, 1998 and 2007  Countryside Surveys the biological condition of streams was  assessed based on the diversity of macro-invertebrates that they  supported. In 1998 and 2007, the stream plant community was also  surveyed to provide additional information on the pollution status  of the watercourses. The physical structure and complexity of the  river corridor was ﬁ rst surveyed as part of the 1998 CS and was  repeated for 2007. Stream macro-invertebrates: The macro-invertebrate  community living in the stream bed was sampled in one stretch of  the selected stream within 350 sample squares, using the national  standard method6. Three squares were not sampled because the  streams were dry when visited. Changes in the biological condition  of streams between the survey in 2007 and those in 1990 and  1998 will be quantiﬁ ed and reported in a separate Freshwater  Report to be published in Autumn 2009. Aquatic plants and condition assessment: Aquatic plants were  surveyed over a 100m stretch of the stream in 361 sample squares,  using the national standard method7. Streams that were dry at  the time could not be sampled. Plant species were recorded only if  submerged or partly submerged in the stream, or rooted on parts of  the stream bed which are likely to be submerged for more than 85%  of the time. A similar survey was undertaken at 414 stream sites in CS squares  in 1998, but this work was not reported at the time. These data  enable an assessment of the changes in the headwater stream  plant communities between 1998 and 2007. Changes to the  diversity of plants at the level of individual streams and at a regional  scale were investigated. Scores were assigned to aquatic plant  species according to their known tolerance to nutrient enrichment  (eutrophication). The Mean Trophic Rank (MTR) method allows the  condition of streams to be assessed based on the observed plant  community, and also permits an estimate of the change in nutrient  enrichment impact on headwater streams since the last CS.  MTR values for a stream site can vary from 10 to 100, with scores  less than 25 indicating eutrophic conditions. Stream physical character: The physical character of the streams  was assessed over a 500m stretch using the national standard  River Habitat Survey (RHS) method8 which records both within- stream and bank-side features. The RHS method records diff erent  aspects of the physical structure of streams at ten checkpoints  along a water channel. Features recorded include bank material,  channel substrate and riverside vegetation structure. Overall  assessments were also made of the 500m length of watercourse  surveyed. All of the data were summarised into an index of physical  habitat diversity, the Habitat Quality Assessment (HQA). The HQA  is a measure of the diversity of natural features present such as  waterfalls and gravel bars; a higher score indicates greater habitat  diversity and therefore higher quality. The RHS can be carried out  on a dry stream channel. Of the 373 streams surveyed in 2007, 350  were also surveyed in 1998 allowing, for the ﬁ rst time, an analysis  of changes to the physical condition of headwaters. Ponds: In 2007, high quality ponds became a Priority Habitat  identiﬁ ed under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. Five criteria are  used to deﬁ ne whether a pond meets priority status. These criteria  are wide-ranging and include plant, invertebrate, amphibian and  pond-type measures. A pond can qualify as a Priority Habitat Pond  on the basis of one or more of the criteria. In CS in 2007, pond  condition assessments were based on plant data. These data have  been used to identify Priority Habitat Ponds using three plant  criteria:   (i)    Presence of a Nationally Scarce, Red Data Book,  Biodiversity Action Plan or legally protected plant species   (ii)    An exceptionally rich site for plants that supports more  than 30 wetland plant species   (iii)   Classiﬁ ed in the top PSYM (Box 1.2) category (Good) with  a PSYM score more than 75% (available for England and  Wales only) Ponds were mapped in the Countryside Surveys in 1990 and 1998,  and in 2007 the biological condition of ponds was also assessed  for the ﬁ rst time. In the 260 sample squares that contained ponds,  the plant community of one randomly-selected pond was surveyed,  using the national standard method9 (Box 1.2). Wetland plants  at each pond were recorded within the area deﬁ ned by the upper  drawdown zone. This is the area of a pond that remains wet until  water levels begin to drop in late spring. Ponds were surveyed  by walking across dry and shallow water areas of each pond to  record plant species. Plant species inhabiting deeper water areas  were surveyed from the water’s edge with the aid of a grapnel.  Associated environmental information relating to the pond  (including amenity use) was also gathered. 6 Murray-Bligh, J.A.D. (1999). Procedure for collecting and analysing macroinvertebrate samples.

Together  with the 2007 data, the 1996 data enabled an assessment of the  extent of change in pond condition in lowland areas of Britain. 1.5   Data analysis and reporting  (Great Britain) 1.5.1 Habitat classiﬁ cation systems The Broad Habitat system was devised and introduced by the  Joint Nature Conservation Committee in 1998, just before the  1998 CS. Both the CS in 1984 and in 1990 were carried out using  earlier deﬁ nitions for habitats that were not directly related to the  Broad Habitat classiﬁ cation and so a translation protocol had to be  developed for these past data to be used. The classiﬁ cation system  used in 1990 was itself developed from the 1984 system and this  1990 translation was relatively straightforward but not without  diffi  culty. However, the translation of recording codes from 1984  into the Broad Habitats has been diffi  cult for some codes, namely  Improved, Neutral, Acid and Calcareous Grasslands and also for  Dwarf Shrub Heath, Bog, and Fen, Marsh and Swamp so we have  used the previously published 1984 data. The same ﬁ eld codes  were used in 1998 and 2007, so reporting changes were  much easier. 1.5.2 Broad Habitat area estimates The area was calculated for each of the 45 Land Classes  (Section 1.3 & Fig 1.1); for England, Scotland and Wales  individually; and for Great Britain. The estimation of the total area  of each Broad Habitat in a Land Class involves multiplying the mean  area of each Broad Habitat in the 1km sample squares in a Land  Class, by the total land area in the Land Class, excluding unsurveyed  urban land and land below the mean high water mark. The estimates  of the area of Broad Habitats for Great Britain, England, Scotland  and Wales were achieved by the summation of the Land Classes  found in each Broad Habitat. The estimates for the area of Broad  Habitats for the United Kingdom were calculated by the addition of  the areas obtained from Northern Ireland Countryside Survey (NICS)  (see Section 1.6) to those obtained for Great Britain. The results  from Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1998 were also combined  so that the change in area of each Broad Habitat could be calculated  and their signiﬁ cance determined. In past Countryside Surveys, comparison between years has been  diffi  cult because of the gradual increase in the number of sample  squares in each of the years. In the 1998 CS, the change between  1990 and 1998 was calculated using only data from those squares  that were surveyed in both 1990 and 1998. For the analysis in  2007 a new statistical model has been used, so that data from all  the squares surveyed in each of the years can be used to create  the Broad Habitat area estimates for each CS. This model ensures  maximum possible use of the collected data and provides means,  standard errors and signiﬁ cance levels for change estimates which  were not possible from the earlier model. The earlier model only  compared squares surveyed in both 1990 and 1998 (change from  1984 to 1990 was not reported) (see Annex 5). The mapped data from each CS can be used to investigate how  Broad Habitats have converted from one to another. Changes in  Broad Habitats as a result of management are slow and the eff ects  Box 1.2: PSYM PSYM, the Predictive SYstem for Multimetrics, is a pond  quality assessment method. It assesses quality using a  range of measures (metrics) each of which has been  shown to vary predictably with degradation. The values  from individual metrics are combined to give a single  measure which aims to represent the overall ecological  quality of the water body. Conceptually, the method is  similar to the stream bioassessment tool (RIVPACS) but  PSYM assesses overall pond quality, rather than speciﬁ c  water pollution status. PSYM assessments are usually based on both plant and  aquatic invertebrate data, because plants and animals  together span a complementary range of sensitivities to  potential degradation factors. Plants are, for example,  particularly sensitive to the water body’s nutrient  status, whereas animals typically exhibit greater oxygen  sensitivity. PSYM assessments can be made using a single  biotic group. In the Countryside Survey of 2007,  plants alone were used for this assessment. There are three plant metrics in PSYM: •  Number of submerged and marginal plant species:  ﬂ oating-leaved species are not included. •  Trophic ranking score (TRS): assigns scores to still-water  plant species based on their known tolerance to nutrient  enrichment (eutrophication). •  Number of uncommon plant species: number of local,  scarce or Red Data Book plant species recorded  at each pond. Diff erent pond types support diff erent plant and animal  communities. The PSYM software programme predicts the  metric values that would be expected at each diff erent  sort of pond if that pond was pristine. The true biological  condition of ponds can be judged by comparing the  observed value of each metric, then the observed value can  be expressed as a percentage of the expected value. In high  quality sites the similarity is high (75%-100% similarity).  As degradation increases, the percentage similarity  between the observed and expected values falls.  For reporting purposes percentage similarity is divided  into four grades of ecological condition: 0% - 24%     Very Poor 25% - 49%     Poor 50% - 74%     Moderate 75% or above   Good 11 Countryside Survey: UK Results from 2007     CHAPTER 1 • Countryside Survey Methodology 1.5.6  Estimation of Priority Habitats from  Countryside Survey data In the 2007 Field Survey, the ﬁ eld surveyor assigned the mapped  polygons to a Priority Habitat, using the vegetation ﬁ eld key.  They could also back-allocate this decision to 1998 if they felt that  on the basis of habitat and species recorded last time there had  been little change. As well as mapping the Priority Habitat they  recorded associated species and were also encouraged to place a  2m x 2m sampling plot (Targeted Plot) in this Priority Habitat if it did  not already have an existing plot located in it. In previous Countryside Surveys (1990 and 1998) existing habitat  codes and species attributes were used to assign the polygon to  Priority Habitat. This was easier for some Priority Habitats than  others (i.e. if there was an existing habitat code that matched the  current deﬁ nition). Even where the same habitat was recorded there  may have been subsequent deﬁ nitional changes, e.g. in Blanket Bog.  are only detected over the long-term through repeated surveys.  The CS surveyors concentrated particularly on identifying and  mapping where change had taken place between Countryside  Surveys. The results are presented as the total area in ’000s of  hectares (‘000s ha) as well as the proportion of Great Britain for  1984-2007 (labelled as % GB) and of the UK for 1998-2007. 1.5.3 Conversion between Broad Habitats Flows to show the net conversion to and from the diff erent Broad  Habitat types between 1998 and 2007 are described. These are  not statistical estimates but serve to provide information on the  direction of ﬂ ow between Broad Habitat types. The ﬂ ows observed  between Broad Habitat areas will include a component of ‘noise’  linked to mapping and data-processing error, as well as real and  hence ecologically important change. 1.5.4  The condition of Broad Habitats between  1990 and 2007 Each of the vegetation sampling plots was assigned to a Broad  Habitat on the basis of its location within the mapped parcels  (Fig.1.3). The vegetation characteristics and condition of the Broad  Habitat was assessed by analysis of the plant species found in each  of the sample of vegetation plots within it, and subsequently gave  a mean value for the plots in that Broad Habitat. Each of the plot  types was analysed in this way for each Broad Habitat. The measures used to assess Broad Habitat condition are listed  and detailed in Box 1.3 (at the end of this chapter). The results  of these analyses are presented as summary results tables in  each chapter. All signiﬁ cant changes in Broad Habitat condition  measures are given at the 0.05 conﬁ dence level (see Section 1.7.1)  and are shown by an arrow indicating the direction of change in  the summary results tables; an upward arrow being positive and a  downward arrow being negative. 1.5.5  The change in vegetation between  1978 and 2007 Long-term change in vegetation from 1978 to 2007 has also been  assessed using the condition measures outlined in Box 1.3.  Only the plots that were surveyed in each of the Countryside  Surveys (1978, 1990, 1998 and 2007) were used for this analysis.  Because there were only 256 1km x 1km survey squares recorded  in 1978 the number of repeat plots is much smaller than the  total number of plots recorded in 2007 when 591 squares were  surveyed. To track long-term changes in vegetation before the  Broad Habitat classiﬁ cation existed, in these analyses the plot  is assigned to the vegetation AC (see Table 1.1) to which it was  classiﬁ ed in 1978. For example, a plot in an arable ﬁ eld in 1978  would be assigned to the AC Crops and Weeds, and all subsequent  changes in condition would contribute to the assessment of this  AC even if the plot was later sown with grass or planted with trees  (see Chapter 10). This permits the fate of a cohort of plots to be  followed through the CS time series, where cohort membership was  deﬁ ned by the AC to which the plot was allocated in 1978.  Headwater stream, England • © NERC 12 Countryside Survey: UK Results from 2007     CHAPTER 1 • Countryside Survey Methodology Various spatial masks were used in post-survey analysis to  delineate the extent of the Priority Habitat. These diff erentiated  habitats into upland or lowland, or in the case of woodlands were  much more speciﬁ c. National estimates were then created using the  same methodology used for the Broad Habitats. Four diff erent spatial masks, or sets of masks, were used  in this work:   i)    The SNH mask: A GIS coverage of Scotland provided by  SNH. This divides Scotland into four regions: lowlands,  marginal, uplands, and montane.   ii)     JNCC masks: A number of JNCC masks were used  delineating the areas in which certain types of woodland  were considered to occur, broken down by country.  The woodlands covered are Lowland Beech (England,  Wales) (ultimately CS was not able to estimate this Priority  Habitat), Lowland Mixed Deciduous (England, Wales),  Upland Mixed Ash (England, Scotland, Wales), Upland Oak  (England, Scotland, Wales). These masks were based on  digitised versions of the indicative range boundaries in  Hall & Kirby (1998). They were recorded in terms of whole  1km squares.   iii)    English Natural Areas masks In England, Natural Areas  based masks were used to eff ect an upland/lowland  separation, to aid deﬁ nition of Lowland Mixed Deciduous,  Upland Mixed Ash and Upland Oak woodlands, and to  deﬁ ne the Native Beech zone (ultimately CS was unable  to estimate this Priority Habitat). Natural area data were  obtained from the Natural England website (www.english- nature.org.uk/pubs/gis/gis_register.asp).   iv)    Welsh Upland mask: The Welsh uplands were deﬁ ned using  an aggregation of land classes in Wales into upland and  lowland environmental zones. 1.5.7  Lengths of linear landscape features,  numbers of ponds and hedgerow trees Linear features in the countryside are often highly complex and  made up of numerous diff erent components; e.g. a single ﬁ eld  boundary may contain a fence, a hedge and a bank. To simplify  reporting of these features, a hierarchy of feature types was used  to deﬁ ne any linear feature (as described further in Chapter 5).  National estimates for linear feature types (in ‘000s km) were  achieved by calculating a mean length for each feature type for the  sample squares within a Land Class; then multiplying this ﬁ gure by  the number of 1km squares in the Land Class. This calculation gives  an estimate of the total length in the Land Class and subsequently,  by summation, of all Land Classes. National estimates of ponds and  hedgerow tree numbers are derived in the same way. 1.5.8 Soils analysis Soil preparation and bulk density: The exact dimensions  and weight of the soil core were recorded together with a digital  photograph and measurements of soil horizon depths. The soil was  air dried, weighed and sieved, after which the separated soil and  stones were reweighed. A sub-sample of soil was then dried at  105°C overnight, cooled and weighed. The mass and volume of the  stones were also determined. The bulk density was calculated from  the mass of soil recorded for each sample, subtracting the stone  content, using the exact dimensions of the soil sample to give  the volume of soil. Results are expressed as grams per cubic  centimetre (g/cm3). Soil pH: Soil pH (the measure of acidity or alkanity) was measured  on the fresh soil sample, sub-sampled after mixing and before  drying, using 10g of ﬁ eld-moist soil in a 50ml plastic beaker to which  25ml of de-ionised water was added, giving a ratio of soil to water  of 1:2:5 by weight. The suspension was stirred thoroughly and left  to stand for 30 minutes after which time the pH electrode was  inserted into the suspension and a reading taken after a further  30 seconds. Soil carbon concentration (0-15cm): Loss on ignition was  measured in a 10g air dried sub-sample taken after sieving through  a 2mm mesh. The sub-sample was dried at 105°C overnight to  remove moisture, weighed, then combusted at 375°C for 16 hours.  The cooled sample was then weighed and the loss-on-ignition  value (%) calculated. Carbon concentration was calculated using the  standard value of 50% of loss-on-ignition values and expressed as  grams of carbon per kilogram (g C/kg) Stock of soil (0-15cm) carbon: This value was calculated by  multiplying the carbon concentration data by the bulk density value,  which when corrected for the area of the original core gave a value  of tonnes of carbon per hectare (t/ha). Statistical analysis: All results were analysed using a  bootstrapping method which makes fewer assumptions about the  structure of the data and thus gives more accurate measurements  of signiﬁ cance. Detailed information on all methodologies is available in the  Countryside Survey Soils Manual available at Annex 4. 13 Countryside Survey: UK Results from 2007     CHAPTER 1 • Countryside Survey Methodology 1.6   Northern Ireland  Countryside Survey (NICS) The NICS is a habitat monitoring research programme carried out  for the Northern Ireland Environment Agency by the University of  Ulster. It was developed independently from CS, but is also based  on the principle of statistically structured habitat sampling and  standardised recording procedures. Baseline ﬁ eld survey was carried out from 1986 to 1991, in seven  regions representing the whole of Northern Ireland (Fig. 1.4).  Field mapping was carried out with a Primary Habitat classiﬁ cation,  supplemented with habitat attributes (information on species,  grazing animals etc.). Habitats were deﬁ ned and mapped with  standardised descriptors and ﬁ eld procedures10. They were recorded  onto 1:10,000 Ordnance Survey maps with a minimum mapping  area of 100m2 and for ﬁ eld boundaries, a minimum mapping length  of 10m. To take account of the small scale of landscape variability  in Northern Ireland, sample squares of 0.5km x 0.5km were used.  Samples were stratiﬁ ed with a multivariate Northern Ireland  land classiﬁ cation11; each of the regions of Northern Ireland was  sampled separately. Regional Habitat area and ﬁ eld boundary  length estimates were derived and their reliability was deﬁ ned by  conﬁ dence limits. The samples from each region were subsequently  combined to calculate Northern Ireland habitat estimates, with an  overall sampling intensity of 1.1% (628 sample squares). 10  Cooper, A., McCann, T.

Ireland • © Mark Wright 14 Countryside Survey: UK Results from 2007     CHAPTER 1 • Countryside Survey Methodology In 1998, the 628 grid square ﬁ eld sampling programme was  repeated to monitor habitat change12 (www.science.ulster. ac.uk/nics/). Field Survey was validated by independent external  assessment; Primary Habitat change in each region and for  Northern Ireland as a whole was estimated. Correspondence  between the Northern Ireland Primary Habitat and UK Broad Habitat  classiﬁ cations was assessed, by combining Primary Habitats to  approximate to the UK Broad Habitat deﬁ nitions. Broad Habitat  estimates were then determined and combined with Great Britain  estimates to derive UK Broad Habitats for CS 2000 and 2007. In 2007, a third phase of ﬁ eld sampling was carried out at an  optimised, proportional 0.5% sampling intensity (288 sample  squares), to derive N. Ireland estimates of Primary Habitat change.  The ﬁ eld data recording structure was extensively modiﬁ ed to  give more species composition detail and attributes were added to  describe habitat condition13. Hedgerow deﬁ nitions were changed  so that they could be deﬁ ned more precisely by shrub and tree  growth form. Electronic ﬁ eld survey protocols were developed for habitat  mapping and attribute recording. Data capture was carried out  with: a hand-held computer loaded with electronic data forms;  high-performance GPS; 1:2,500 Ordnance Survey maps and NICS  ecological maps from 1998 (Fig. 1.5a). Colour aerial photographs  were used as a ﬁ eld mapping aid. For data analysis, GIS was used  to relate ﬁ eld database records to OSNI 1:2,500 vector maps,  overlaid onto colour digital aerial photography (Fig. 1.5b). Data were  subsequently linked to digitised polygons for database and spatial  analysis using ArcGIS. NICS Broad Habitats, additional to those reported for 1998,  were estimated by constructing littoral zone, montane zone and  freshwater lake sampling strata appended to the Northern Ireland  land classiﬁ cation. Sample squares additional to the NICS sampling  programme were allocated in order to survey these strata.  The correspondence between Primary Habitat and Broad Habitat  classiﬁ cations was reﬁ ned, to take account of changes in UK Broad  Habitat deﬁ nitions. 12  Cooper, A., McCann, T., Meharg, M. (2002).

The emphasis in this report is on the analysis and evaluation  of stock and changes at the GB or UK level. Country level reports  for England, Scotland and Wales will be published in Spring 2009  and these will give more detailed analysis of relevance to each  particular country. Broad Habitat data are reported for the UK and  individual Countries. Table 1.4 summarises the results presented  in this Report. 1.7.1. A note on signiﬁ cance of changes For ease of presentation in tables, a minimum signiﬁ cance level  with a probability of 0.05 has been adopted (i.e. there is only a 5%  chance of the result occurring by random chance). Arrows are used  in the tables to indicate signiﬁ cant changes at the 0.05 probability  level and the direction of the arrow indicates if the change was an  increase (upward arrow) or a decrease (downward arrow). Many of  the results are signiﬁ cant at either 0.01 or 0.001, as indicated in  ﬁ gures where they occur. Signiﬁ cant changes in the ﬁ gures between sampling dates are  indicated with a bracket between those dates, so a signiﬁ cant  change between 1990 and 2007 would have a bracket extending  between 1990 and 2007. The signiﬁ cance of the change is  indicated by the number of * symbols (* p<0.05, ** p<0.01, ***  p<0.001). In the supporting text, brief comments are given on  the ecological importance of signiﬁ cant changes. As CS involves  numerous records, quite small changes in the values of condition  measures can sometimes be statistically signiﬁ cant, although  in ecological terms they may mean very little. Means for 1998  and 2007 are provided in the tables to help the reader to see the  magnitude of diff erences between years. In graphs, the variation  in the sample around the mean is shown by using 95% conﬁ dence  limit bars. The measures of vegetation condition are summarised in Box 1.3.  Oat sheaves, N.

Condition Measure Explanatory Notes Species Richness Total number of non-native and native taxa per plot (excluding lichens, mosses and liverworts but  counting species recorded to genus only or amalgamations of two taxonomically diffi  cult species).  This is a simple measure of plant diversity. Increases in plant diversity may not always be  beneﬁ cial for habitats. Number of Farmland Bird Food Plants The number of plant species in each vegetation plot that are known to be important in the diet of a  range of declining lowland farmland birds.4, 6 Number of Butterﬂ y Food Plants The number of plant species in each vegetation plot that are known to provide food for butterﬂ y  larvae (caterpillars). The list of plants includes those that provide food for common as well as scarce  butterﬂ y species.4 Grass:Forb Ratio The natural log of the ratio of the total grass cover in each plot to the total forb cover in each plot.  Forbs are: all plant species that are a) not woody, such as trees and shrubs; b) not grass-like; or  c) not mosses, lichens or liverworts. •  The term is most frequently applied in grasslands where the conservation value of the vegetation is  considered to be higher if grass cover is accompanied by high cover of other meadow herbs such as  buttercups, yellow rattle, red clover and birds-foot trefoil. •  The Grass:Forb Ratio can also be applied in woodlands where ‘forbs’ would cover plants such as  bluebells, wild garlic and ferns. • Strictly speaking, the term ‘herbs’ also includes grasses, whereas the term ‘forbs’ excludes grasses. • An increase in grass species results in an increase in the Grass:Forb Ratio. Competitor Score Plant strategy theory predicts that under conditions of high fertility and minimal disturbance,  tall perennials well adapted to out-compete other plants for light will eventually dominate plant  communities. The resulting vegetation may be species-poor. However, woodlands are a good example  of a vegetation type dominated by competitors that can be rich in biodiversity. The competitor score is  the proportion of competitive species in each plot 3, 4, 5 and is relative to both the Stress tolerator and  Ruderal Scores described below. Stress-tolerator Score Stress-tolerant plants are typically well adapted to harsh environmental conditions such as extremes  of temperature and shortages of nutrients or light. They are often slow growing and vulnerable to  disturbance or increased fertility. This group includes some of the rarest plants in the British ﬂ ora.  The stress tolerator score is the proportion of such species in each plot 3, 4, 5 and is relative to both the  Competitor and Ruderal Scores described above and below. Ruderal Score Ruderals comprise all those plants often thought of as weeds. These plants are early colonisers which  disappear as environmental conditions stabilise; they are adapted to take advantage of the often  short-lived opportunities for growth and reproduction provided by disturbance. Their strategy is one of  quick arrival and quick disappearance. As a result they are often small, fast-growing and produce a lot  of seed. The Ruderal Score is the proportion of such species in each plot 3, 4, 5 and is relative to both the  Competitor and Stress-tolerator Scores described above. Light Score An indirect measure of light availability at ground level. It reﬂ ects the abundance of plants that either  tolerate shade or cast shade (e.g. woodland plants) through to weeds found in open, often disturbed  situations, where there is much less shade. This association is based on the Ellenberg value for light of  each species.1, 2 1 = Shaded to 9 = Open Fertility Score An indirect measure of soil fertility. It reﬂ ects the abundance of plants known to be associated with  diff erent levels of nutrient availability based on the Ellenberg value for fertlity of each species.1, 2 1 = Infertile to 9 = Eutrophic Ellenberg pH Score An indirect measure of soil pH. It reﬂ ects the abundance of plants known to be associated with  diff erent levels of pH based on the Ellenberg value for soil reaction of each species.1, 2 1 = acidic to 9 = alkali Moisture Score An indirect measure of soil wetness. It reﬂ ects the abundance of plants known to be associated with  degrees of wetness, based on the Ellenberg value for soil moisture of each species.1, 2 1 = Dry to 12 = Water 17 Countryside Survey: UK Results from 2007     CHAPTER 1 • Countryside Survey Methodology Contacts For further information on Countryside Survey see  www.countrysidesurvey.org.uk or contact:  Countryside Survey Project Offi  ce,  Centre for Ecology and Hydrology,  Lancaster Environment Centre, Library Avenue,  Bailrigg, Lancaster LA1 4AP Telephone: 01524 595811 Email: countrysidesurvey@ceh.ac.uk COPYRIGHT: This publication is the Copyright of the Natural  Environment Research Council, November 2008 Copyright: of all graphs, diagrams and charts is owned by the  Natural Environment Research Council Copyright of photographs: Unless stated otherwise, Copyright of  photographs is owned by the Natural Environment Research Council Copyright enquiries should be addressed to:  Knowledge Transfer Team, Centre for Ecology and Hydrology,  Maclean Building, Benson Lane, Wallingford  OX10 8BB This publication, excluding logos, may be reproduced free of charge  in any format or medium for research, private study or the purposes  of internal use within an organisation.

CHAR_Jun_Nov_2020_Camera_Trap_Image_Catalogue_Supporting_Document Following the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in April 1986 a 5000 km2 exclusion zone surrounding the plant was created; people and farm animals were subsequently evacuated from the area. In April 2020 there were severe wildfires within the Ukrainian part of the exclusion zone (2600 km2) where approximately 870 km2 was burnt. The NERC funded CHAR project conducted a study which involved placing motion activated digital camera traps at three sites (each covering an area of 80 km2) within the Ukrainian exclusion zone from June 2020 - August 2021 to assess large mammal activity following the fire. Thirteen cameras were randomly located at each site; all camera deployment locations had been used in a previous study 2014-2015 (https://tree.ceh.ac.uk/content/chernobyl-webcams). The camera traps used were all Ltl Acorn 6210MC. Each camera location had a unique numerical identifier (e.g. 1570) and each camera had a unique serial number (e.g. 0848); the unique serial number is displayed on the images. The three 80 km2 sites at which the cameras were deployed within the Ukrainian exclusion zone are identified numerically within the dataset: Site 1 was located in the northeast of the zone and is the most contaminated; Site 2 was located on the 'western trace' of the accident release plume and has a large contamination gradient; and Site 3 was located to the south of the zone and is the least contaminated (Fig 1.).   Fig 1. Location of the camera traps, numbered using the unique numerical identifier for each location. The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is shown by the radioactive trefoil symbol and the acronym ChNPP. The Cs-137 data presented are decay corrected to 2021. The cameras were able to capture images both day and night (and during the transition period) by using a passive infrared (PIR) sensor and an invisible infrared flash (set to 940 nm, capable of lighting an area of up to 10 m in front of the camera). The cameras automatically choose the appropriate day/night/transition setting based on light level however these periods are subjective as the camera automatically chooses the setting. Cameras were positioned with the camera lens at a height of approximately 0.6-0.7 m above the ground (usually attached to trees) to primarily record images of medium/large mammals (although some images of smaller mammals, birds and occasional insects were also captured). Most cameras faced north to minimise false activation caused by direct sunlight. Tall grasses, bushes and tree branches that were likely to obscure the camera or cause false activation were cleared from an area of approximately 100 m2 in front of the camera where and when necessary. No bait was used to attract animals. When deploying each camera for the first time, 16 poles (1 m high with markings at every 20 cm) were positioned in front of the camera in three parallel rows one metre apart; the two outer rows began three metres in front of the camera and ended eight metres away from the camera, the middle row had an additional pole at 2 m in front of the camera. The camera was activated to capture an image of the poles in situ and the poles were then removed (an image of the pole positions at each site has been included within the dataset; some of these images also contain images of co-authors). The images of the poles can be used to estimate animal height and distance from the camera should this be desired. All cameras were pre-set to take a three image burst per 'triggering event' (when the camera PIR sensor was triggered) with an interval between the three images of 0-1 seconds. The recovery time between image capture and any subsequent three burst cycle was approximately 2-4 seconds; it was therefore possible that some animals (or birds) may not have been captured if they were moving quickly. A triggering event begins when the camera motion sensor is triggered by an animal or bird. A new triggering event begins after at least 90 seconds have elapsed since an animal was last observed; however, there may be longer time periods between triggering events where images are obviously part of the same sequence (e.g. an animal lies down for a period of time). Images and associated metadata were downloaded from each camera memory card in November 2020 by Chornobyl Center staff and this information was subsequently supplied to UKCEH as .jpeg and MSExcel files respectively. Using these files, the image catalogue was populated by one member UKCEH staff with:  species identified in image number of animals visible in image the number of triggering events (cumulative by camera) any relevant notes.  Site descriptions and camera information were supplied to UKCEH by Chornobyl Center as MSExcel files; the same person from the Chornobyl Center recorded all descriptive parameters. The information provided includes: site field notes, habitat descriptions, camera location (latitude and longitude, WGS84), estimates of ambient dose rate (µSv h-1), camera deployment dates and the number of days each camera was deployed. For quality control purposes, another member of UKCEH staff and staff at the Chornobyl Centre investigated any queries and the dataset was amended where necessary. The images included as part of this dataset are located within three subfolders: 'Setup1_Site1'; 'Setup1_Site2' and 'Setup1_Site3'; each of these folders then contain further sub-folders with the format e.g. 'Setup1_Site1_1570' which corresponds to the 'Image_Location_Folder_Name' column within the image catalogue (see table 1) . Within each of these folders are further sub-folders, one for each of the common species names of animals observed. The individual images of each animal, bird or insect are located within these folders and are supplied as part of this dataset as .jpg files. There are no images included in the dataset for camera 1556 (located towards the Western edge of Site 2) as the camera was stolen and also no images for camera 1541 (located towards the Northern edge of Site 3) as the camera not switched on in error. The data comprise a catalogue of 61736 camera trap images obtained during the period June - November 2020; this period is described within the dataset as setup 1. Images have been catalogued individually within the file: 'CHAR_Jun_Nov_Camera_Trap_Image_Catalogue'.  Table 1. Columns in the image catalogue (CHAR_Jun_Nov_2020_Camera_trap_Image_Catalogue.csv) All the images obtained during setup1 are included as part of the dataset with the exception of those containing people, vehicles or members of the CHAR research team setting up and servicing the cameras; these images have been catalogued but the images are not included in the dataset to protect privacy. Triggering event numbers are sequential for a given site and camera. The total number of individual animals, birds, people or vehicles recorded during any one triggering event is given on the first data row related to any one particular event; all other data rows related to that event are marked as n/a (not applicable). Where the first image in a triggering event contains 'nothing', the notes state which species triggered the camera (e.g. 'camera triggered by Red deer') and the total number of animals seen per triggering event is then shown against the first image that contains e.g. Red deer. Where an image containing nothing is part of a triggering event that also contains images of a particular species the appropriate triggering event number is entered. For images containing nothing that are not part of a triggering event that contains images of a particular species, n/a (not applicable) is entered as the triggering event number. Where more than one species was present within an image, a separate row has been created for each species (the notes contain the text '2 species in image'). For images recorded as 'service' n/r (not recorded) is entered in the columns 'number animals in image' and 'total number animals per triggering event', and the 'triggering event number' is marked as n/a (not applicable). Service visits generally occurred at the start and end of each camera's deployment period, however, some 'service' entries are entered as 'people' if a service visit took place mid-way through a camera deployment period. For images containing people or vehicles, the number of people or vehicles is recorded in the columns 'number animals in image' and 'total number animals per triggering event' however, the 'triggering event number' is marked as n/a. These records of images containing people and vehicles have been catalogued as disturbance caused by human activity in the vicinity of the camera may have an impact on animal behaviour and hence the species seen. Species captured on the camera trap images over the period June - November 2020 are listed in Table 2 together with the number of images (rows) recorded in the image catalogue for each particular species; it is not the number of unique images for a particular species and each image may contain multiple individuals. There were also some mammal and bird species which were unidentifiable because of picture quality.  Table 2. Species captured on the camera trap images over the period June - November 2020. aUnless other taxonomic information is provided (e.g. Class, Order, Family). bMultiple animals may be present in any one image. cSpecies only mentioned within the notes column of the image catalogue. dThis is a mammal or bird but could not be positively identified (e.g. eyes shining in the night. eIdentifiable insects are included within the image catalogue together with a comment in the notes column of the image catalogue describing their taxonomic order. n/a Not applicable as these species only occur in the notes column and are not definitive identifications. Images containing people (n=76) have not been included. Table 3.

The data was derived  from satellite data collected by the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper. Data can be provided for  any area of the country, under Licence, and is used for a wide variety of applications by  business, government and researchers. Data from the map provides:   • the first complete map of the land cover of Great Britain since the 1960s    • the first time the land cover of Great Britain has been comprehensively mapped from  satellite information    • the first digital map of national land cover   • accuracy to the field scale, checked against ground survey      The Land Cover Map comprises 25 classes, including sea and inland waters, bare,  suburban and urban areas, arable farmland, pastures and meadows, rough grass, grass  heaths and moors, bracken, dwarf shrub heaths and moorland, scrub, deciduous and  evergreen woodland, and upland and lowland bogs. It can be used to plan, manage or  monitor agriculture, ecology, conservation, forestry, environmental assessment, water  supplies, urban spread, transport, telecommunications, recreation and mineral extraction.  Current examples of the application of the Land Cover Map include detection of changing  land cover, landscape management, mapping bracken in the context of health studies  (bracken supports ticks carrying human disease), environmental assessments of motorway  extensions, and planning of  telecommunication lines.      Introduction    The Land Cover Map of Great Britain (LCMGB) was produced using supervised maximum  likelihood classifications of Landsat Thematic Mapper data (Fuller et al. 1994a). The map,  based on a 25m grid, records 25 cover types, consisting of sea and inland water, beaches  and bare ground, developed and arable land, and 18 types of semi-natural vegetation -  these are described more fully below. By combining summer and winter data, classification  accuracies were substantially improved over single-date analyses (Fuller et al. 1994b). In  all, 88% of Britain was classified from combined summer-winter images, and 12% from  single-date, mostly summer, data. Just 0.4% of Britain was obscured by cloud cover on  both summer and winter images. The missing areas of offshore islands represent just  0.1% of Britain. This document aims to give details about the map classes, the map's  resolution and the way in which classes are depicted. Further details, which relate the map  and its cover types to the results of other surveys, are given by Wyatt et al. (1994).        Spatial resolution & registration    It has been suggested (Townshend, 1983) that the minimum accurately map-able unit  from TM data would be of the order of 3 to 5ha. In practice, in the LCMGB, most features  of 1ha show clearly, giving a map which records patterns at a field by field scale.   Superimposed on this 'minimum accurately map-able area' is a finer pattern of those  smaller features with strong enough spectral signatures to discriminate them from the  background cover: for example, roads, farms, shelter belts, water bodies and grass tracks  are evident throughout the cover maps. After removal of isolated pixels, these are shown  in units as small as 2 pixels (0.125 ha) (Fuller et al. 1994a).    Registration of the Landsat-derived raster maps to 143 vector field-maps of 1km squares  showed average displacement to be 0.8 pixels (20m): 75 out of 143 squares needed no  shift to achieve correspondence with vector overlays; 43 squares needed a one pixel shift;  15 squares needed 2 pixels movement and only 10 squares needed more than 2 pixels 4 movement relative to the vectors (Fuller et al. 1994a). This positional error is fully  acceptable for most applications of the data.        Classification accuracy    Quality checks require access to 'ground truth data', but the accuracy of such data is  rarely known (Congalton, 1991). Conventional maps are most commonly used, but their  division of a continuum of landscape patterns into discrete classes, with hard boundaries is  not 'truth' but an artificial generalization, which achieves different results according to the  rules and methods employed. A recent study has revealed the wide variations in  definitions of land cover (Wyatt et al., 1994). In assessing the LCMGB, it is important to  note that the reference surveys also set out with different methods, different objectives  and also differing potential in terms of the details they could record. Comparisons can only  give indications as to LCMGB accuracy but they help point to sources of error and highlight  the impacts of generalization and class definition.     Comparisons with independent ground reference data, for 508 1km squares, showed  correspondences which varied depending on the level of detail at which comparisons were  made. Many of the apparent discrepancies are due to significant differences in class  definitions. Whereas the Landsat classification, like the Ordnance Survey, used a  hydrological definition of bogs (see later), the field survey used a botanical definition  which, in contrast, included wet moorlands. There were also differences in how the two  surveys divided the continuum from grass, through heather-grass mixtures, to dense  shrub heaths. There were differences, too, in dividing the continuum from rough  grasslands to managed swards. There are no fixed conventions in such divisions and  variations can arise between individual surveyors within a survey: a quality assurance  exercise, which re-examined the 1km field data, showed an average 84% correspondence  when the original surveyors' coding of land cover was compared with a quality standard.  Allowing for different definitions, the overall correspondence between field and LCMGB  samples is 67%.    The biggest component of map error is likely to be the misclassification of mixed boundary  pixels. Some 40% of all pixels adjoin or cross a vector boundary and were thus made up  of mixed cover types and additional boundary features. Correspondence was raised to  71% when boundary pixels were excluded. There are minor discrepancies due to  geometry, where a feature was correctly classified but slightly displaced. In dissected  landscapes this would have had a major impact. It is desirable, though not easy, to  distinguish between misclassification and mis-registration. The satellite-derived map might  be an accurate measure of cover, pattern and relative distribution, but with minor spatial  differences relative to equivalent products.     Other differences reflect changes in cover between surveys, sometimes 2 years apart. For  example, a pasture on one date, ploughed on the other. If we allow for likely time-based  changes, overall correspondence is measured at 76% including boundary pixels, or 82%  excluding boundaries.     Users of the data should be aware that these observations represent average error-rates.  As with any average, the value represents a combination of lower and higher figures. Local  discrepancies may be observed which seem to suggest higher or lower accuracy rates: this  is only to be expected.    As previously noted, no survey could have delivered the 'ground truth' needed for exact  validation; but it is possible to assess the probable meaning of results summarised here.  If, as seems likely, the original CS90 field survey was close to the quality assurance  survey and each 'correctly' recorded 90-95% of the landscape, they would have  overlapped by around the measured 84%. If the Landsat survey achieved 80-85% success  (a figure regularly achieved in pilot studies (Fuller et al., 1989a; b, Parsell, 1990)), then 5 the correspondence with the field survey would have been around 67-71%. These are the  range of figures obtained if we allow for the obvious interpretation differences, with an  element of temporal change. In conclusion, a realistic assessment of Land Cover Map  accuracy is probably 80-85%.    For more details on accuracies see Fuller et al. (1994a) and Wyatt et al. (1994).

LCM 1990 classes   Introduction  The following descriptions outline the ITE Landsat-derived cover types used in the Land  Cover Map of Great Britain. The choice of classes represents a compromise between what  would be ideal for wide-ranging users, and what was feasible to map, at this scale, from  remote sensing datasets. The classes chosen represent an aggregation of many  subclasses: for example, wheat, barley and oilseed rape are subclasses of the 'arable'  class. These subclasses have been reduced to a short-list of target 'classes' which are  considered ecologically meaningful, consistently recognisable from the selected imagery,  and realistic in terms of their likely accuracy. It would be possible to recombine subclasses  differently, for example a map of 'graminoids' might be produced by aggregating all grass  subclasses, including natural grasslands, agricultural pastures and arable cereals. Very  likely, specialist users will require a 'tailor-made' aggregation to meet specific objectives,  and this could be done digitally, by reference to the original maps of subclasses. Such  users would have to accept that subclasses might not be distinguished consistently (e.g.  not all images were of appropriate date to separate, for example, wheat from barley within  the arable class).    The descriptions aim to record any limitations which would prevent further subdivisions to  consistent standards. All classes are subject to the provision that they are only mapped if  they are above the minimum map-able size, namely two pixels, i.e. 0.125ha, though in  practice it cannot be said that all 0.125 ha features are shown - this will depend on how  strong the spectral signature of a feature is and how pixels fall with respect to that  feature. Minimum consistently map-able area could be 5 ha (Townshend 1983). In  practice, the real value is probably between these two extremes, and perhaps nearer to  1ha. 6   At present, the list distinguishes lowland and upland categories which are similar, for  example lowland heather and upland dwarf shrub. These classes have spectral  characteristics which allow their separation, but not with the same level of accuracy as  would be available in separating classes with entirely different characteristic species.  Regional upland and lowland masks have been created from the cover-classes and  coarsely filtered in order to generalise the classification into lowland and upland types.  Some users may feel that other measures of context (e.g. altitude) are better criteria for  separation, in which case such separations are best made in a geographical information  system (GIS).    Agricultural grassland subdivisions have been taken further than spectral signatures may  justify, because of the importance and extent of agricultural swards (see later). The  situation with grasslands is complex: in addition to the interplay of species and altitude,  there are extra difficulties imposed by soil-acidity, wetness and, more especially, by  complex and ever-changing patterns of grassland-management. In the continua from  lowland to upland, from wet to dry, from basic to acid soils and from natural to intensively  managed, many classes might be identified. Agriculturalists and conservationists may not  necessarily define the same classes, nor would a class be consistent from one agricultural  region to another - a rough pasture in SE England might be considered to be good in  montane Scotland for example. It is also true that discrete classes may not be spectrally  separable, especially where management (e.g. mowing) obscures the characteristic  appearance of the various components. Those classes which are defined here are thought  to be ecologically meaningful and separable with good reliability. They are, most  importantly, intended to be consistent throughout Britain.      How to use this class description  This class description document is structured in terms of the two levels of classification at  which the Land Cover Map of Great Britain is being made available as a standard digital  product: as either the full set of 25 'target' cover-types, or as an aggregation of these into  17 'key' cover-types.  The 25 classes are those provided as standard in the 25m spatial resolution data; the 17  classes are those provided as standard in the 1km summary data. In the former, there is  just one layer of data, with values or 'labels' between 0 and 25 representing the  designated cover type of each 25 x 25 m grid cell. In the 1 km summary data there are 17  layers, one for each 'key' class. Each layer records the cover for one 'key' class. The values  for each 1 km grid cell represent the proportion of that cell that has been designated as  being of a particular key cover-type. So, layer 1 holds the cover per 1 km cell for 'key'  class A, layer 2 the summary cover data for 'key' class B, etc. This proportion is expressed  as an integer percentage value, e.g. if 320 of the original 1600 25m cells within a  particular 1 km cell were of key cover-type G (marsh/rough grass) then the layer for this  class would have a value of 20 (%) for this 1 km cell in the 1 km summary data. (As  indicated in the Introduction it is also possible to provide non-standard 'customised' data,  e.g. the 25m data could be provided as the 17 key cover-types, rather than as the 25  target cover- types.)  In the 1 km summary data the integer percentage values are presented class by class and  these may be thought of as distinct sets or 'bands' of data. The second column of Table 1  shows that in the full 17 class data set the order of these bands follows that of the letters  A - Q. If a subset of the 17 key cover-types was requested then the corresponding band  numbers would change, e.g. if data for only classes B, G, M and Q were requested then  these would be bands 1, 2, 3 &mp; 4 respectively. 7 A - SEA/ESTUARY  This category includes all open sea and coastal waters, including estuaries, normally inland  to the point where the waterway is constricted to 1 pixel or its continuity is broken by a  bridging point. An exception is where waterways open up again into major estuarine  features, such as Breydon water near Great Yarmouth or many of the sea lochs on the  north-west Scottish coast. The division will be immediately evident by reference to  classmaps. It is not intended to accurately show the limit of saline or tidal waters, which  may extend much further inland.  Fuller key-name: Sea, coastal waters and estuaries, inland to the first bridging point or  barrier.  This category carries the label '1' in the 25 'target' class dataset.      B - INLAND WATER  Inland water includes all map-able fresh waters and any estuarine waters which are  excluded in the above category. The maps record only those areas which are water- covered on both the winter and summer images. Thus, reservoirs with summer draw- down, or winter-flooded meadows are classified to the summer class (i.e. bare or  grassland in these examples).  Fuller key-name: inland fresh waters and estuarine waters above the first bridging point or  barrier.  This category carries the label '2' in the 25 'target' class dataset.      C - COASTAL BARE GROUND (BEACH / MUDFLATS / CLIFFS)  The coastal bare ground category includes intertidal mud, silt, sand, shingle and rocks. It  also includes bare maritime habitats above the tide-line, such as shingle beaches, mobile  sand dunes and bare rocks or soil of coastal cliffs. A covering of sparse vegetation, such as  pioneer salt marsh, dune or shingle species will not put the beach into a vegetated class  unless the majority of the substratum is covered.  Distinction of this cover type is dependent on the level of the tide on the days of imaging  (the lower tide being used to define the lower limit of the beach). Thus discrepancies can  arise where high tides prevailed on imaging.  Fuller key-name: bare coastal mud, silt, sand, shingle and rock, including coastal accretion  and erosion features above high water.  This category carries the label '3' in the 25 'target' cover-type digital data set.      D - SALTMARSH  Areas of seaweeds are sometimes sufficiently extensive to show as vegetated intertidal  plant communities. The may comprise the green alga Enteromorpha intestinalis or the  brown wracks (Pelvetia caniliculata, Fucus spp. and Ascophyllum nodosum) growing on  rocks, boulders and sometimes gravels, sands and muds. Saltmarshes are intertidal sand-,  silt- or mud-based habitats, colonised by halophytic grasses such as Puccinellia spp, and  herbs such as Limonium spp., Aster tripolium and Triglochin maritima. They remain mostly  green in winter. For the purposes of this classmap, only those marshes up to normal high  water spring tides (i.e. those flooded monthly) are included. The upper saltmarsh,  inundated only on extreme high-water spring tides, is dominated by coarse grasses such  as Agropyron spp.. These are classified accordingly as marsh / rough grass (see below).  Distinction of this cover type is dependent on the level of the tide on the days of imaging  (the lower tide being used to define the lower limit of the seaweed beds or saltmarshes).  Thus discrepancies can arise where high tides prevailed on imaging.  Fuller key name: intertidal seaweed beds and saltmarshes up to normal levels of high  water spring tides.  This category carries the label '4' in the 25 'target' class dataset. 8 E - ROUGH PASTURE / DUNE GRASS / GRASS MOOR  There are potential problems of confusion between lowland grass heaths and upland grass  moors, largely because the species complements are similar. However, there are sufficient  differences that spectral separation may be reliable. It has also proved possible to  separate the two using a digital mask to correct regional misclassifications (see  introduction). Some users of the maps and data may choose to aggregate the two classes,  for later separation in a GIS, but using their own contextual definition based on altitude,  climate, latitude and longitude or combinations of any such variables.    Grass Heath  This class includes coastal dunes and inland grasslands typically growing on sandy soils,  usually acid in character. The species might include, on coastal dunes, Ammophila  arenaria, Festuca rubra and Carex arenaria and a wide variety of herbaceous species,  often winter annuals. Inland, and on mature 'grey' dunes, all but Ammophila might be  present, but acid-loving species are typical, including Festuca ovina, Agrostis spp. and  Deschampsia flexuosa set in a carpet of lichens and mosses (Duffey et al. 1974). The  latter species are also characteristic of marginal hill-grasslands and a zone of semi-natural  acid grassland may lie between the agricultural grasslands of lower hill-slopes and  moorland communities on the hill tops. These swards are characteristic of north-western  Britain, mostly on land between 100-200 m, but right down to sea level in north-west  Scotland.  In winter, the lowland grass heaths have substantial quantities of dead plant litter,  distinguishing the lowland grass heaths from agricultural swards, but the litter content is  less than is typical of coarse rough grasslands, offering a spectral distinction from these.  Fuller key-name: semi-natural, mostly acid, grasslands of dunes, heaths and lowland- upland margins This category carries the label '5' in the 25 'target' class dataset.    Moorland Grass  This class includes upland swards, mostly of deciduous grasslands, often referred to as  grass moorland or upland grassy heath. They are typically dominated by Nardus stricta  and/or Molinia caerulea, with Festuca ovina, Deschampsia caespitosa, Juncus spp. often  including sparse cover of upland dwarf shrubs. These swards form large tracts of mostly  unenclosed hill-grasslands, lightly grazed often by sheep.  Fuller key-name: montane/hill grasslands, mostly unenclosed Nardus/Molinia moorland.  This category carries the label '9' in the 25 'target' class dataset.      F - PASTURE / MEADOW / AMENITY GRASS  Agricultural grasslands comprise many types, from newly sown leys, of single species, to  largely unimproved swards of indigenous species. This range is subdivided in many  different ways by the many different surveys of grasslands (see Fuller 1987). Here we  must be constrained by what is possible, with acceptable accuracy, using satellite imaging.  Certainly, the class 'pasture/meadow/amenity grass' can be identified with good  consistency. It characteristically forms a cropped sward, comprising finer grass species (eg  Festuca, Agrostis, Lolium and Poa spp.) often with many other grasses and herbs. The  sward is maintained by mowing and/or grazing, such that coarser species of grass, herbs  and scrub cannot become dominant.  In agricultural and conservation terms, there is an important distinction between  'improved' and 'unimproved' swards. Improvement may involve reseeding, herbicide  treatments, and/or fertiliser applications which promote the growth of 'preferred' species,  especially Lolium perenne. Swards which are essentially 'unimproved', or which have  reverted, contain a dominant proportion of indigenous species (Fuller 1987).  Improved pastures or close-mown amenity swards are mostly distinguishable on satellite  imagery: they remain green in both summer and winter. Unimproved swards are generally  used at a low intensity and are typically unenclosed. They are also likely to be discernible  from intensive pastures because of their rougher texture, their weed content and the  quantity of plant litter they carry in winter (all factors which affect overall reflectance). The  problem is that hay meadows, of both the lowlands and the partially improved lower 9 slopes of upland areas, could be confused with either improved or unimproved swards,  depending on the stage of management in the particular year of imaging e.g. growing hay,  standing hay, cut hay, aftermath- grazed. This obviously depends on the date of the image  available for classification (and only days may separate the four types).  The 25 class classification identifies two types of pasture/meadow/amenity grass, which  are be retained as separate class numbers in the database, but could be aggregated to a  single colour- class for map and data outputs, depending on the measured accuracy and  user requirements. It should be realised that the classes are readily inter-changeable by  changing management practices, and such changes may take place on a cyclical basis  (e.g.  where  swards  are  mown  one  year  grazed  another).  The  two  pasture/meadow/amenity grass subclasses are described below.    Mown / Grazed Turf  Mown/grazed turf grasslands are managed either as agriculturally productive swards or  mown as amenity grasslands. They are mostly agriculturally 'improved' by reseeding  and/or fertiliser use and would normally contain high quantities of Lolium perenne and/or  other preferred species. Their key characteristic is that they did not, at either date of  imaging (summer or winter), have any detectable quantity of dead plant material, nor a  substantial uncropped stand of living material. This implies that the swards were grazed or  cut and thus maintained as a turf throughout the growing period. This management  prevented the sward from reaching flowering height in summer and ensured that there  was little or no standing crop of plant litter to influence the winter-reflectance of the  sward.  Fuller key-name: pastures and amenity swards, mown or grazed, to form a turf  throughout the growing season.  This category carries the label '6' in the 25 'target' class dataset.    Meadow / Verge / Semi-natural swards  Meadows and verges include grasslands which are managed, but mostly at a lesser  intensity than the 'mown/grazed turf' class. Partial improvement favours productive  species such as Lolium perenne, and herbicide treatment may reduce the content of  broadleaved 'weeds' but some of the swards in this category represent the traditional hay  meadows which have escaped improvement. The swards may be mown for hay and  perhaps aftermath- grazed.  Semi-natural swards may have much the same appearance. Festuca/Agrostis swards are  typical of the indigenous, essentially unimproved grasslands, of neutral to acid soils,  mostly enclosed, formerly covering much of Britain's grazing land, but now restricted to  upland margins and odd pockets of lowlands, usually on floodplains. The swards are  characterised by Festuca rubra and ovina, Agrostis stolonifera, A. tenuis and/or A. canina,  often with substantial quantities of rushes (Juncus spp.), sedges (Carex spp.) and  broadleaved plants. Alternatively, the semi-natural grasslands may be agriculturally non- productive swards which are managed by occasional cutting to prevent excessive weed or  scrub growth, e.g. roadside verges, country parks, golf course semi-rough areas.  The key characteristic of this class is that the swards were not a short-cropped turf  throughout the year - either they were grazed at low intensity such that patches of  unpalatable species became sufficiently dominant to produce a higher standing crop than  on pastures. Or the swards were used for hay and appeared as a long grass sward  awaiting mowing or grazing: or, perhaps, they had recently been mown for hay. The  important characteristic is that they were cropped by the time of winter imaging, to  remove much of the standing crop of grass. Thus, by winter they were mostly green rather  than a straw- coloured stand of plant-litter as would be typical of natural swards of coarse  grasses. This class forms a transition, often in appearance, perhaps in species contents  and productivity, often in terms of time (i.e. improving or reverting) and especially space  (a transition zone), between improved pastures and the 'natural' grasslands of heaths and  moors.  Fuller key-name: Meadows, verges, low intensity amenity grasslands and semi-natural  cropped swards, not maintained as a short turf.  This category carries the label '7' in the 25 'target' class dataset. 10 G - MARSH / ROUGH GRASS  In the 25 class data the marsh/rough grass category comprises three types, separated to  distinguish established rough swards from new colonisation. In the 17 class list these are  amalgamated.    Ruderal weed  The ruderal weed cover-type is generally bare ground being colonised by annual and  short- lived perennial plants, usually with a considerable remnant of bare ground,  especially in winter. The ground may be naturally bare, e.g. shingle beaches, or  abandoned arable land, e.g. set-aside, or derelict industrial works such as demolished  factories, gravel pits etc. This category is rarely extensive enough to map, was chosen to  classify what might have been extensive areas of set-aside, and is aggregated with the  rough grass class for maps and most data summaries.  Fuller key-name: ruderal weeds colonising natural and man-made bare ground.  This category carries the label '19' in the 25 'target' class dataset.    Felled Forest  Recently felled forest, usually with large quantities of brush-wood etc, comprise this class.  As they re-vegetate, felled areas re-colonise with ruderal weeds, and then become rough  grassland. Although originally selected in the anticipation that they would be relatively  commonplace, felled areas are rare. They will be aggregated with 'marsh / rough grass'  class for most display purposes and data-summaries.  Fuller key-name: felled forest, with ruderal weeds and rough grass.  This category carries the label '23' in the 25 'target' class dataset.    Rough / Marsh Grass  This class includes lowland herbaceous vegetation of fens, marshes, upper saltmarshes,  and rough or derelict ground. The characteristic feature of this category is that the swards  are not significantly cropped by mowing or grazed by stock. In fact most are unenclosed  grasslands, abandoned from economic use. The result is that they have a high standing  crop of vegetation, most of which dies back in winter, leaving a dense plant litter.  Fuller key-name: lowland marsh/rough grasslands, mostly uncropped and unmanaged,  forming grass and herbaceous communities, of mostly perennial species, with high winter- litter content.   This category carries the label '8' in the 25 'target' class dataset.      H - GRASS / SHRUB HEATH  In the 25 class dataset open shrub heath and open shrub moor are kept separate. In the  17 class data they are aggregated into one class.    Open Shrub Heath  This category complements the above moorland variety of grass /shrub heath. However,  because intensive grazing of lowland heaths is no longer practised, the incidence of this  class is rare. It will be found where knowledge-correction has identified an area of the  grass / shrub heath mixture as being in a lowland zone.  Fuller key-name: lowland, dwarf shrub/grass heathland.  This category carries the label '25' in the 25 'target' class dataset.    Open Shrub Moor  This cover type is fairly commonplace on some marginal hill grazing land, especially in  northern and western parts of Britain, where grazing prevents the dominance of dwarf  shrub species. It is also extensive in Calluna moorland, as a result of moor-burning to  maintain young heather regrowth to promote grouse populations. Initial regrowth  produces grassy swards, which over a period of years revert to heather-cover. As the  heather senesces, so moorland is re-burnt, with a repeat cycle of perhaps 10 years.  Whereas other transient cover-features of management (e.g. haycutting, arable crop-type)  are not defined because of their short-lived nature, the 10-year cycle is judged long 11 enough to justify the distinction between currently managed and unmanaged areas. The  proportionate cover of Calluna which is required to alter the classification from 'burnt' back  to 'dwarf shrub' is not yet clear: this will become evident on comparison of classmaps with  corresponding 1km field squares of Countryside 1990.  Fuller key-name: upland, dwarf shrub/grass moorland.  This category carries the label '10' in the 25 'target' class dataset.      I - SHRUB HEATH  In the 25 class dataset dense shrub heath and dense shrub moor are kept separate. In the  17 class data they are aggregated into one class.    Dense Shrub Heath  Dense shrub heath refers to communities with high contents of heather (Calluna), ling  (Erica spp.) but perhaps mixed with broom (Cytisus scoparius), gorse (Ulex spp.). It is  mostly evergreen, hence different from other scrub communities. Almost invariably, it  represents vegetation on sandy soils, in characteristic sites like the Brecklands, and the  Dorset and Surrey Heaths, or on extensive coastal dune systems.  Fuller key-name: lowland evergreen shrub-dominated heathland.  This category carries the label '13' in the 25 'target' class dataset.    Dense Shrub Moor  The dense shrub moor communities include heather (Calluna vulgaris), ling (Erica spp.)  and bilberry (Vaccinium spp.) moorlands. Though dominated by woody shrubs, these may  be mixed with herbaceous species, especially those of the moorland grass. The dense  shrub moors may be managed by moor-burning, in which case they may be bare, for most  of the first year after burning; then the grass / shrub heath mixture is found until dense  shrub growth again dominates the cover.  Fuller key-name: upland evergreen dwarf shrub-dominated moorland.  This category carries the label '11' in the 25 'target' class dataset.      J - BRACKEN  The bracken class is herbaceous vegetation dominated by Pteridium aquilinum. It may be  upland or lowland, mixed with grass and other species. The obvious characteristic is that  the distinctive colour of winter bracken dominates the reflectance of the community.  Fuller key-name: bracken-dominated herbaceous communities. This category carries  the label '12' in the 25 'target' class dataset.      K - DECIDUOUS / MIXED WOOD  This category comprises all deciduous broadleaved trees, broadleaved and includes mixed  stands, where they cannot be separated spatially. The 25 class data identifies two cover  types.    Scrub / Orchard  Scrub and orchard areas are deciduous, often with substantial herbaceous vegetation.  Typical species include sallow (Salix spp.) in wetlands, or hawthorn (Crataegus  monogyna), brambles (Rubus fruticosus agg.) and saplings or small trees: these include,  of course, fruit trees. Although commonplace, the scrub category is rarely extensive  enough to record more than just a few pixels. The exceptions are in areas of orchards  (though these are only found in a few areas), and in semi-natural vegetation, for example,  the sallow-carr woodlands of the Broads or hawthorn scrub on chalk downland. For map-  production purposes and in most data summaries the scrub and deciduous woodland  classes will be amalgamated.  Fuller key-name: deciduous scrub and orchards.   This category carries the label '14' in the 25 'target' class dataset. 12 Deciduous Woodland  The deciduous characteristic separates it from evergreen species, as it appears bare in  winter. However, deciduous woodland has a unique spectral signature which separates it  from other deciduous vegetation and from arable land. Mixed woodland may be included  with this category, though continuous evergreen stands, where greater than the minimum  map-able area, will be separated.  Fuller key-name: Deciduous broadleaved and mixed woodlands.  This category carries the label '15' in the 25 'target' class dataset.      L - CONIFEROUS / EVERGREEN WOODLAND  Coniferous/evergreen woodland comprises coniferous species (including the deciduous  larch (Larix spp.), plus other evergreens such as holly (Ilex aquifolium), Rhododendron (R.  ponticum), yew (Taxus baccata) or Holm oaks (Quercus ilex). As well as remaining in leaf  all year round, the species generally have very dark leaves or needles, giving them unique  signatures in both summer and winter.  Fuller key-name: Conifer and broadleaved evergreen trees.  This category carries the label '16' in the 25 'target' class dataset.      M - BOG (HERBACEOUS)  Bogs are widespread in upland areas especially to the north and west of Britain. They are  also found locally in lowland areas. They are characterised by permanent water-logging,  resulting in depositions of acidic peat. The 'bogs' of this classification are mostly  herbaceous communities of wetlands with permanent or temporary standing water  (Ordnance Survey maps show the same areas using 'marsh' symbols). Wet heather  moorlands, which botanists may refer to as 'bogs', are not generally mapped as such on  topographic maps (OS maps show them as 'heaths'), and are mapped by this survey as  dwarf shrub categories. As with other heathland and moorland classes in the 25 class data,  a distinction is made between upland and lowland variants of this class.    Lowland bog  Lowland bogs are rare in much of Britain, due to drainage and peat extraction. However,  local large areas of bog are to be found on the west coast of Scotland. They carry most of  the species of upland bogs, but in an obviously lowland context, with Myrica gale and  Eriophorum spp. being highly characteristic.  Fuller key-name: lowland herbaceous wetlands with permanent or temporary standing  water.   This category carries the label '24' in the 25 'target' class dataset.    Upland bog  Upland bogs have many of the species of grass and dwarf shrub heaths and moors, but  are characterised by water-logging, perhaps with surface water, especially in winter. The  water- logging promotes species such as bog myrtle (Myrica gale) and cotton grass  (Eriophorum spp.) in addition to the species of grass and dwarf shrub moorlands.  Fuller key-name: lowland herbaceous wetlands with permanent or temporary standing  water.  This category carries the label '17' in the 25 'target' class dataset.      N - TILLED LAND (ARABLE CROPS)   Tilled land includes all land under annual tillage, especially for cereals, horticulture etc. It  also includes leys in their first year, ie if they were bare at the time of the winter imagery.  Other land, vegetated at the time of summer imagery but bare soil during the winter, is  also included in this land cover type: hence any temporarily bare ground (e.g. from scrub- clearance, development, mining or soil tipping) would be classified in this category.  Fuller key-name: arable and other seasonally or temporarily bare ground.  This category carries the label '18' in the 25 'target' class dataset. 13 O - SUBURBAN / RURAL DEVELOPMENT  The suburban/rural development category includes all land where the pixels of the Landsat  image have recorded a mixture of built-up land and permanent vegetation. Most suburban  and rural developments, where the buildings and associated car-parks etc. remain small  enough that they do not fill all of each pixel, are included in this cover-type. Small rural  industrial estates, glasshouses, railway stations, larger rural roads, villages, small retail  sites are all included in this class.  Fuller key-name: suburban and rural developed land comprising buildings and/or roads but  with some cover of permanent vegetation.  This category carries the label '20' in the 25 'target' class dataset.      P - URBAN DEVELOPMENT  The urban development category covers all developments which are large enough to  completely fill individual pixels, to the exclusion of significant quantities of permanent  vegetation. It includes cities, large town centres, major industrial and commercial sites,  major areas of concrete and tarmac, plus permanent bare ground associated with these  developments, such as car-parks and tips.  Fuller key-name: industrial, urban and any other developments, lacking permanent  vegetation.  This category carries the label '21' in the 25 'target' class dataset.      Q - INLAND BARE GROUND  The inland bare ground category includes all 'natural' surfaces such as rock, sand, gravel  or soil, though their origin has often not been natural: the exceptions are coastal features  which classify as beach/mudflat/cliffs. Ground which has been bared by human activities,  or by livestock would be included. Imported surfaces of sand or gravel (eg car parks)  would also be classed as bare ground.  Fuller key-name: ground bare of vegetation, surfaced with 'natural' materials.  This category carries the label '22' in the 25 'target' class dataset.      UNCLASSIFIED  Within the 25m data about 2% of Great Britain remains unclassified, i.e. unallocated to  any of the 25 'target' cover-types described above. These occurrences represent (i) some  small areas within scenes that were either obscured by cloud upon both the summer and  winter imagery used for the classification, (ii) some locations for which a single scene of  cloud free imagery was not available to the mapping project (e.g. the island of Tiree), and  (c) some areas of unusual cover types that were not defined by the classifier training  exercise.  In the 25m grid cell data these cells are uniquely labelled, with the value '0', in the same  manner as those cells designated to one of the 25 target cover-types. In the 1km  summary data the proportion of each 1km cell that is unclassified is represented by  default, by the difference between the sum of the values for the 17 key cover-types and  100.  Fuller key-name: cover-types which did not fit into the 25 'target' classes.  This category carries the label '0' in the 25 'target' class dataset.      Land Cover Map 2000 is now available. Further information on its creation and potential is  available within the Countryside 2000 website, some sample data (1km resolution) can be  seen here, and is available for download at the Countryside Information System data  download site.

COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000  QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE  M.V. Prosser and H.L. Wallace  April 1999  Ecological Surveys (Bangor) The School House, Canon Pyon, Herefordshire, HR4 8PF  Report to the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, Merlewood Research Station. SUMMARY  Introduction : It is recognized that in a field investigation on the scale of the Countryside 2000 survey the large number of recorders and surveyors involved must produce an inherent degree of variation despite the provision of a training course, a field handbook and on-site visits by supervisors (Quality Control). It is therefore important to attempt a measure of the consistency and reliability of the work done within the major components of the field programme (Quality  Assurance).  A sample comprising 38 of the 519 squares surveyed in 1998 was selected and in each of these one quarter was resurveyed. The resurvey involved the recording of 234 species plots  covering the nine plot types defined in the CS2000 methodology.  The Quality Assurance Exercise investigated:  e the efficiency of plot relocation  ® species concordance i.e. the reproducibility of species records made by the original surveyors  e the reliability of percentage cover estimates of the principal species recorded  e the effect of the level of recording on the results obtained when subject to the normal techniques used to demonstrate habitat change with particular reference to the presence or absence of directional bias in the CS2000 survey  e the level of comparability between the efficiency of the CS2000 survey and that of the CS1990 survey  e the accuracy of the landuse mapping of the 1Km squares  ® the efficiency of the recording of changes in landuse  Plot relocation Of 210 plots for which a full search was made, only 28 could not be satisfactorily relocated by the assessors; this percentage recovery (86.7%) is almost identical with that found during the 1991 QA of the 1990 survey (87.1%) and this finding demonstrated that markers and plots  could be relocated equally well after eight years as after 12 months.  The CS2000 surveyors were found to have precisely relocated 60% of the 1990 plots, to have approximately (but acceptably) relocated a further 25% and to have failed to adequately find 15% of plot positions. The small, 4m’, Habitat Plots (Y-plots) proved the most difficult to  relocate, having a failure rate of 23%. Accuracy of species records . Of approximately 6000 species records in the 210 plots analysed and drawn from a sub- sample comprising thirty-eight 1Km squares:  e 71% were confirmed as species present in the plot by the assessors at the time of their resurvey ® non-concordances totally a further 2% were attributable to real changes due to  management or seasonal effects between original survey and assessment  This indicates an initial recording accuracy of 73%, only slightly lower than that found for the CS1990 survey (estimated at c.78%). The difference of 5% is exactly accounted for by the increase in species mis-matches due to errors in plot location by the surveyors. The circumstances of the 1990 and 1998 surveys were quite different. Plots used in Countryside Surveys prior to 1990 were not permanently marked and hence no estimate for the non- concordance due to errors of plot location could be arrived at in previous surveys. If the change in circumstances is taken into account, then the level of efficiency of species recording  in 1998 is the same as that in 1990.  The report includes a detailed breakdown of the nature of species mis-matches between the 1998 field survey and the QA exercise and comparisons with similar data from the CS1990  survey.  Estimates of vegetation cover When a comparison was made of the 30 most frequent species forming appreciable cover. six (all grasses or grass-like species) had been recorded at significantly different levels in the plots by the surveyors and assessors; one of the disparities was certainly, and another very probably, due to seasonal effects. These results compare rather unfavourably with those of the 1990 survey but this relative failure is counterbalanced by an improved level of agreement  (74.4%) in the cover levels awarded at the landuse sample points.  Direction of vegetation change When data for changes in species composition and species cover within individual plots between original survey and assessment were subjected to a DECORANA correspondence analysis, the overall axis shift was insignificant. When the results were partitioned by plot type and by landclass, there were again no instances of a significant difference in axis score. The variations in species recording and in the awarding of cover levels are thus shown to be  unbiased or random with respect to the direction of change.  Landcover mapping Landcover mapping involved the use of a series of codes (given in Annex C) which may, for  the purpose of analysis, be subdivided into three groups. *® primary codes -  ® secondary descriptive codes * ¢ cover codes; a further characterisation of a given parcel of land using a combination of the mapping of the most prevalent species together with a code denoting the cover of  each  The levels of agreement for the different code groups were:  Primary landcover codes Primary boundary codes  Where direct comparisons are possible, the levels of concordance achieved are very similar to  those found between the CS1990 survey and its QA.  Recording of change  A sample of instances of alterations to the 1990 code string involving changes made either by the CS2000 surveyors or by the assessors was analysed in order to test the level of agreement in the nature of landcover and boundary changes. The sample contained 177 instances of change: of these, 29 (16.4%) were considered by the assessors to reflect errors or omissions in the 1990 survey. The results suggest that between 51 and 59% of the changes occurring were correctly recorded by the surveyors. This is a disappointingly low figure and suggests that, if the sample is representative of the survey as a whole, a substantial proportion  of changes that have occurred since 1990 will have been missed. te  Introduction . It is recognized that in a field investigation on the scale of the Countryside 2000 survey the large number of recorders and surveyors involved must produce an inherent degree of variation despite the provision of a training course, a field handbook and on-site visits by supervisors (Quality Control). It is therefore important to attempt a measure of the consistency and reliability of the work done within the major components of the field programme (Quality  Assurance).  Aims (a) To quantify the accuracy of field recording in CS2000 and to comment on the accuracy of change statistics. (b) To examine the efficiency of plot relocation (c) To seek to explain any differences in recording in terms of observer error or bias, plot location and relocation, type of plot recorded, management and seasonal effects (d) To relate the findings with regard to overall accuracy of recording to the levels of agreement  between survey and assessment found during the previous 1990 Countryside Survey. Methods and Scope of QA Exercise  A sample containing 38 of the 519 squares surveyed in 1998 was selected and in each of these one quarter was resurveyed. 34 of the squares had been included in the 1990 Countryside Survey whilst the remaining four represented a sub-sample of the xx squares introduced for the first time in 1998,  The protocol for determining the location of points to be used as the basis of the assessment of land cover mapping and boundary feature recording and for the selection of plot types to be re- recorded is given in Annex A of this report.  The full list of squares monitored, with times of original survey and assessment resurvey, is given as Annex B. Those squares also selected in 1990 for the QA exercise and repeated in 1998 are highlighted.  The seven main plot types used in the CS2000 survey and re-examined and analysed as part of  the QA exercise may be sub-divided into quadrats and linear plots thus:  Quadrats 200m xX plots  4m”  Y plots repeats of a plot type introduced for targeted habitats in 1990 Uplots a new plot type introduced for use in unenclosed  (BAP) broad habitats. Linear plots, all 10m x 1m, which include; Road verges, commencing adjacent to and siesta with the carriageway. A second parallel strip was originally surveyed in the case of wide verges (not included in the QA exercise} Hedges, running parallel] with the hedge line and commencing at the mid-point of the hedge. Simple 50m hedgerow diversity plots, introduced in 1998, have also been included in the QA exercise.  Streamsides, from normal water level or at the lower limit of vegetation cover in the case of  water courses with extensive gravel or pebble beds etc. Boundaries, in enclosed land only; recorded at the boundary marker (plate) associated with  the 200m’ X plot.  A small number of the newly mtroduced 100m x im arable field margin plots were resurveyed and are discussed but, since the sample size was small, are not included in the  analysis of the results.  THE RECORDING OF THE PLOTS  Plate location  5.  An attempt was made in each case to relocate the buried metal plate marking one corner of each quadrat using the original 1990 sketch map (and sometimes an amended version annotated by the CS2000 surveyors), the surveyors photograph of plot location and a metal detector. The plot may often in practice be accurately relocated on the basis of the sketch map measurements and a good photograph. It was, however, considered important to investigate the effectiveness with which the plates themselves could be physically relocated eight years on and to compare the ‘recovery rate’ with that after one year based on the results of the 1991 QA exercise. It was also thought to be essential that a comparison be made between the efficiency of the CS2000  recorders in plate and plot relocation and that achieved by the QA assessors .  The QA exercise involved the recording of 234 plots. These were distributed across the different  plot types as follows. X 41 Y 34 U 17* H 23 S 31 R 30 B 34 D (Hedge diversity) 19 A (Arable margin) 5  * The targeted number of ‘U’ plots was 19 but two could not be even approximately located and  were abandoned  Efforts to establish the accuracy of plate and plot location are complicated by a discrepancy in the totals for the two situations; not all plots have markers. Many X-plots, mostly those situated close to boundary features, share the boundary plate whilst the more distant X plots or those in  unenclosed land have their own plate. In a few instances the surveyors did not use plates to mark the plots and in at least two cases the plate has been disturbed during farm management since 1990. The totals, both for plots and plates will be higher in the case of the QA assessment of CS2000 than for the CS2000 relocation of the CS1990 plates since the former includes both the assessment of new squares for which the search is for CS2000 plates and the relocation of ‘U’ plots not used in 1990.  Table 1(a) and (b) summarised the findings of both exercises in plate and plot location.  Table 1. Plate and Plot relocation.  C$S2000 (Total number of plots = 170).  Plot Plates expected | Plates found | Plots found Plots approx. Plot not found or plus plots refound incorrectly found positioned  (b) QA Assessment (Total number of plots=210).  Plot Plates expected | Plates found | Plots found Plots approx. Plot not found or plus plots refound incorrectly — p —S eC _|  X (1) = X plot having its own plate X (2) = X plot located via B-plot plate  Four categories of performance were recognised with respect to the relocation of survey plots within a  square: 10.  I. Plate and hence plot located; in the case of the CS2000 surveyors these are instances where the recorder clearly states that a plate was re-found and the species record substantiates this claim. .  II. Plate not found, or no plate used, but assessor satisfied that location of CS2000 plot or QA plot closely matches original location. This includes a substantial number of cases where the CS 2000 surveyors probably found the plate but did not indicate this on the data sheet.  III. Plate not found; assessors concluded that plot was only approximately relocated.  IV. Plate not found; information insufficient to allow even approximate location but plot  clearly in correct general area (three plots, where the directions were so woefully inadequate as to prevent even this low level of relocation were abandoned and so do not  appear in the record).  The assessors were successful in locating 69.3% of plates; this compares with the 65.2% recovery in the 1991 QA of CS1990. It is therefore shown to be equally possible to relocate a plate eight years on as 12 months after its burial.  It is not possible to provide a precise figure for the success of the surveyors in finding essentially the same sample of plates; they definitely found 23.3 % of plates and the total recovery rate could possibly have been as high as the sum of categories (i) and (ii) i.e. 59.4 % but is thought to have been in the region of 40% to 45%. Whilst it is true that the assessors had the benefit of familiarity with many of the plot locations and expected to find most of the plates, it is still evident that some of the CS2000 searching must have been less than wholehearted. In one instant the assessors located the 1990 plate and, accidentally, the new 1998 plate within 65cm of each other; at least two linear plot pairs of plates were refound within 2m of each other. In conversation with one surveyor the assessors were told of the delight in finding a 1990 plate -  hardly the sentiments of a team expecting to be routinely successful.  The results suggest that 60% of plots were accurately relocated by the surveyors, 25% were more or less relocated and c.15% of plots were inadequately relocated by the CS2000 teams. This compares with 87% adequately relocated by the QA team. There were several instances of the surveyors finding the correct location and, sometimes inexplicably, recording it incorrectly: on the wrong bank of a stream or the wrong side of a hedge. In one irntating case the 1990 surveyors clearly stated and showed on the sketch that they had erroneously recorded a roadverge plot on the wrong side of the plate yet the CS2000 team recorded the ‘correct’ plot and were hence the full 10m out of position. This was not the only instance of surveyors failing to read the words. One 1990 boundary plot sheet included the instructions ‘plate 7 fence posts from large straining post’. It was evident from the species record that in 1998 the plot had been run from the straining post and so failed to achieve even a minimal overlap with the plot. In another instance the original plot was stated as being along a fence; the CS2000 record was for  the hedge at least a metre behind the fence. The result of the apparently rather cavalier approach to plate search was that new plates were frequently employed - this is going to make the task of the next cohort of surveyors even more difficult. .  Species concordance  11.  12  13.  The mean species number per plot was found to have increased significantly between the original 1990 Countryside Survey and the QA assessment made in the following year. It was originally suggested that the diversity recorded during full survey might have been depressed under the drought conditions prevailing in that summer. The increase m species recorded in 1991 was however virtually the same in northem upland squares, unaffected by drought conditions, as for the country as a whole; the mean increase across all plots in the 1991 QA record was 13%. A similar comparison has been made between the CS2000 survey and its assessment made in the same year.  The results are presented in Table 2 and are of considerable interest.  Table 2. Comparison of species numbers per plot CS2000 v. QA.  Mean species number  | Plot type | N | Cs2000_| QA ___| CS2000% |p | es ee ee ee eee eee <0.001 XT at 9.8226 | 87.6 | 0.001 |  [Hf 23] 6S | 84 | 89.7 | 0.019 | [BT 3468 | 200 | 84.0 | <0.001 |  p = results of paired t-test comparison of CS2000 and QA  The QA exercise again frequently produced a longer species list per plot and, interestingly, the magnitude of the increase was almost identical with that reported previously:  1991 QA as % increase over the 1990 Survey for all plots recorded = 13.04%  1998 QA as % increase over the 1998 Survey for all plots recorded = 13.97% Since the same pair of assessors were used in both QA exercises, there is a strong implication  that the efficiency of search of the 1990 and 1998 survey teams has been remarkably similar. The mean number of species per plot has declined significantly since the time of the 1990  survey. In 1990 and 1991 the order of plots, in terms of their richness, was the same in both  survey and QA; in order of decreasing mean species number per plot:  6.8.8.8... 8 . % 14.  In 1998, the results of both surveyors and assessors again ranked the plots in an identical order but the road verge plots now exceed the streamside plots in richness; the streamside plots .  showing the greatest decrease in mean number of species per sample since 1990.  A variety of measures may be used to compare aggregate records made for the same plot at different times; the 1991 QA report examined four such indices. Two of these have been retained in the present draft.  a) Species common to both samples divided by the aggregate of species at time one (T1) and at time two (12) and expressed as a percentage: this may be termed Percentage Agreement and produces the simplest, crudest, but most objective value.  b) Species common to both samples divided by the total number of species recorded at T1 plus T2 minus the T2 mismatches and expressed as a percentage. This may be referred to as Surveyor Accuracy (% Efficiency) and is intended to remove variations due to e.g.  season, management and errors attributable to the assessors rather than the surveyors.  Annex B presents a summary of these two measures for each of the 38 squares assessed in the 1998 QA exercise. The values presented are averages derived from the individual plot records  within each square.  Allocation of T1 and T2 variation as a percentage of total mis-matches  15.  Species recorded by CS2000 surveyors but not confirmed for the plot by the assessors (T1  variations).  Types | -9  1) Mis-identified in CS2000 and forming a couplet with the, hopefully, correctly identified species recorded at QA  2) Mis-identified in CS2000, not apparently forming a couplet with any species recorded during the QA exercise e.g. where both Convolvulus arvensis and Calystegia sepium appear in the T1 record but only one of these species was found at T2.  3) Wrong box ticked at CS2000, e.g. pairs of species adjacent on the data sheet. Primula vulgaris-Prunella vulgaris and Ranunculus flammula-Ranunculus ficaria are the most frequently encountered examples. Categories 1-3, if combined, are equivalent to the variations of Type A, mis-identified, in the 1991 QA report.  4) Species considered to have been overlooked during the CS2000 recording. The allocation of species to this category was relatively straightforward, especially for linear plots, when the QA assessors were confident that the CS2000 surveyors had accurately relocated the plot. However, in situations where it was apparent that the CS2000 plot and the assessors plots did not exactly overlap, or where the CS2000 surveyors were clearly in the wrong place, the assessment was extended to include a search of that area of the CS2000 plot which was not part of the ‘real’ plot in order to distinguish between species not recorded by  the CS2000 surveyors because of their incorrect plot location (errors 7 and 9), species 16.  5)  6)  7)  8)  9)  which were present in their plot but not recorded (error 4) and extra species recorded due to their plot location (error type 8).  Over-zealous recording. During the QA exercise particular care was taken to restrict recording to the exact plot size stipulated. The surveyors had, in some instances, not adequately measured the plot or had included species adjacent to but not strictly within the defined area.  Mysteries. Species records, apparently incorrect, for which no reasonable explanation could be advanced.  Species mis-matches due to the incorrect orientation of the plot by CS2000 surveyors These errors relate to species mis-matches due to the CS2000 plot being recorded in only approximately the correct location, i.e. adjacent to or overlapping the original location or where the plot must have been markedly skewed in relation to the cardinal bearing.  Species recorded due to wrong location of CS2000 plot. Species which were recorded by the CS2000 surveyors (which were not in the QA plot) because the CS2000 surveyors were in the wrong place. Examples: S plot recorded on the wrong side of a stream; B plot started from the wrong straining post; R plot recorded in the wrong direction from the start point; H plot of the road side when it was originally on the field side.  Species not recorded by the CS2000 surveyors due to wrong plot location. The converse of 8, species which were in the QA plot but not recorded by the CS2000 surveyors due to their  incorrect plot location.  T2 Variations Types 20 -24.  20)  21)  22)  23)  Species mis-matches due to management changes in plots between CS2000 survey and QA assessment, These involve changes in crop type, changes in species recorded due to crop management, verge mowing etc. They represent species which were very probably present when the CS2000 surveyors recorded the plot but which were no longer evident at the time of the QA exercise (e.g. Cynosurus and Anthoxanthum in mown hay meadows). Conversely, regrowth of species by the time of the QA assessment in plots which had been recently mown at time of the CS2000 survey, especially on road verges.  Species mis-matches due to seasonal changes between CS2000 and QA assessment. The execution of the QA exercise within the same season as the CS2000 survey was expected to reduce the magnitude of this error term but some species, especially annuals, were still included in the mis-matches between the two surveys.  Species mis-matches due to the incorrect positioning of the QA assessors plot. Equivalent to the type 8+9 errors at time 1.  Species mis-matches due to doubtful orientation of the QA plot . Equivalent to type 7 errors  at time 1. 24) Species missed by the QA assessors. Species which were in the plot but only recorded when the plot was searched a second time during the comparison of the initial QA record with the  C$2000 surveyors record.  57 The total combined species record for CS2000 and its assessment = 5841 records: of these, records common to Tl and T2 = 3585. The mis-matches can be partitioned, as a percentage of  the total non-concurrences, as shown in Table 3.  Table 3. Allocation of T1 and T2 variation as a percentage of total mismatches.

The circumstances of the 1990 and 1998 surveys were quite different. Plots used in Countryside Surveys prior to 1990 were not permanently marked and hence plot orientation and location errors were confined to inadmissible records arising through a combination of the positioning of the plot in a way which did not correspond with the standard protocol and failure to note this on the sketch which accompanied the species record. The plots were not precisely relocatable. The exercise in true plot location is a new venture and since it is estimated that only approximately 45% of the plots exactly duplicated the exact position, the increased species non-concordance due to mis-location of a little over 5% could be regarded as  highly satisfactory under the more rigorous requirements of the CS2000 protocol.  Comparison of other mis-matches  20.  Mis-identification: increased from 2.5% to 3.4% of the total record. Much of this is due to confusion within Poa and Agrostis species. Rumex, Ranunculus and Stellaria were also generally producing a fair number of mis-[D couplets. The assessors were lenient with respect to the identification of Rosa spp - many recorders confining themselves to using the Rosa spp code. This was wise since where species identification was attempted most surveyors produced clearly incorrect records.  Overlooked species: the proportion of species apparently overlooked within the plot was remarkably similar to that estimated for the CS1990 survey and continued to provide the greatest  number of non-common records. Although considerable effort was devoted to partitioning mis- 21.  matches between ‘overlooked species’ and those missed due to mis-orientation it is not possible to exactly segregate these non-concurrences (see Paragraph 21).  * Over-zealous: much improved since 1990, The error term has been reduced from over 2% to less  than 1%.  In easily relocatable linear plots such as road verges and hedgerows it is a relatively simple matter to partition Tl errors between species present but overlooked and those due to mis- location or mis-orientation. In the X plots and, to an even greater degree, the small Y and U plots, such distinctions are less clearly arrived at. However, since recorders have a very consistent search image, it is to be expected that the proportion of species overlooked will be roughly proportional to the number of species present in a sample irrespective of the plot type involved.  If the mean number of mis-matches attributed to Type 4 (overlooked) for each plot type is  calculated, the following results are obtained;  Splots R B U x H ¥ 5.6 45 43 42 38 33 21  This pattern closely resembles that of the gradient of mean species richness found (Para. 13) and it is thus felt that the mis-matches categorised as species overlooked at T1 are likely to be  reasonably accurate.  The recording of vegetation cover  22  As an integral part of the original recording schedule, surveyors were required to give visual estimates of cover for any species perceived to exceed 5% cover im the plot. These estimates were repeated during the QA. The comparison of cover values presented in Table 5 matches  estimates made by surveyors and assessors across all plot types.  10 Table 5.

(Species which only ever occurred at the 1 or 5% cover band were excluded from these analyses. )  The results of the 1991 QA demonstrated that only two of the principal species, Holcus lanatus and Poa trivialis had mean covers awarded which differed significantly between surveyors and assessors; the same pair of species are again prominent in the list of species with differing mean cover but are joined in 1998 by Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Arrhenatherum elatius and Eriophorum vaginatum.  All the discrepancies involve grasses or grass-like species; the covers of no commonly encountered herb species differed significantly between the two sets of records. The similarities in the covers awarded to Lolium perenne, Agrostis stolonifera and Agrostis capillaris are  encouraging and go some way to counterbalance the rather poor agreement for these species  11 seen in the land cover mapping codes (Paragraph 42). The variation noted for Anthoxanthum is almost certainly an effect of season, the species being much more prominent in early season .  before the QA exercise commenced.  Changes in frequency of the most prevalent species  24,  25:  Although there are approximately 35% of mis-matches between species records when direct comparisons are made between individual pairs of plots, it might be expected that these differences would, for many of the commoner species, average out over a large number of plots. To test this assumption the frequencies of all species recorded in the CS2000 sample and its QA  have been compared. The results for the principal species are presented as Table 6.  The ranking order of records from surveyors and assessors is broadly similar though rather less so than in the CS1990 survey. It is not possible to apportion reasons for the individual discrepancies with any confidence but the following points may be made:  a) The recording of mosses was generally poor and the frequent omissions from the CS2000 records have been a factor in depressing the overall percentage agreement between survey and QA and hence the percentage efficiency of the recording.  b) The over-recording of Poa trivialis often stems from a tendency to record this species when any Poa species was encountered in a quadrat.  c) In contrast, the under-recording of other grasses, notably Agrostis capillaris, Elymus repens, Arrhenatherum and Cynosurus seems to arise from a general level of unfamiliarity with these species in a vegetative state whilst Festuca rubra is often simply overlooked. A quirk of the recording in 1998 has been the tendency to award very high levels of cover to the coarser grasses such as Arrhenatherum, Elymus and Dactylis when they are recorded. There is little concordance between the frequency of a species and the mean cover it attains; this quite normal situation is, however, exaggerated in the CS2000 sample.  d) Ranunculus repens is frequently recorded as R. acris whereas the figures for Cirsium arvense include records for Cirsium vulgare, occasionally Cirsium palustre and once Cirsium acaule.  e) Taraxacum and Galium aparine were under-recorded in CS1990 and this has been repeated in CS2000. The former is sometimes recorded as a Crepis whilst it seems that Galium aparine is often missed if in a seedling stage; this may also account for the overlooking of  Hedera and Rubus fruticosus in some plots.  12 Table 6.

A synopsis of the results of the nineteen samples which comprise the QA of these plots forms Table 7.  The total species record made by the assessors exceeded that of the CS2000 surveyors by 14.1%,  a very similar value to that obtained for the QA as a whole. This is rather disappointing since the  13 plots were simple to search and a higher recording rate was to be expected. The hedge.diversity  plots seem to have been treated somewhat as an afterthought; on a substantial number of .  occasions a woody species correctly recorded in the ‘H’ plot was omitted from the diversity plot  of which it is part, hence the high total for ‘overlooked’ species.

The level of  concordance in these samples was, however, extremely poor.  In summary: Total species record for the five plots tll Common species records 34 Species recorded at T1, not at T2 24 Species recorded at T2, not at Tl 33 % Agreement 30.6  There will be very considerable differences in the arable weed population between May and October and so many of the mis-matches will be due to season. The impression gained however was of samples less scrupulously recorded than the standard repeat plot types. The surveyors may have been less familiar with ruderal species than with those of other habitats. Many of the concordances were of common grasses or herbs growing in an arable situation with recognition of true ruderals seeming much less certain; identification of Veronica and Euphorbia species in particular left much to be desired, the suspicion being that for the former genus at least a quick glance at the illustrations in Rose was used rather than anything more rigorous.  It is probably sensible, though hardly cost effective, to plan the remaining field work so as to  allow at least two visits, well spaced in time, to any future arable margin plots.  Overall effects of species change  29  30  Changes in apparent species composition have been demonstrated for individual plots of all types. In order to assess the effects of this variation on the plots as a whole, the quadrats have been arranged in a continuum using the first axis of a DECORANA analysis as the gradient. All pairs of quadrats of a single plot type have, with a small number of exceptions. been pooled. Each quadrat pair consists of that from the original CS2000 survey and that from the QA reassessment. Six X-plots which took the form of a narrow strip at the crop edge have been omitted, as have two Y-plots, one containing a single species and one placed in saltmarsh vegetation; the inclusion of these eight plots would have unduly distorted the ordination plot. For each allowed pair the change in axis score has been plotted against the percentage agreement in the species compliment between the two times of survey. The assumption to be tested is that, though the axis scores for individual pairs may shift markedly due to e.g. a gross mis-match in recording or in the assignment of cover or through failure to accurately relocate a particular plot, the results for the two total records should form a single population with little or no overall shift  in mean axis score.  The resulting graphs for individual plot types form Figure 1(a-c). Three plot types are  represented in the figure; those omitted display a very similar distribution of points.  15 Figure 1.

No single cause for large discrepancies is evident; most can be attributed either to problems of plot location, inefficient species recording (including significant mis-identifications and the overlooking of  species present), and marked disparities in the awarding of cover values for species recorded.  No correlation exists between the shifts in axis score and the percentage agreement in species concordance between plot pairs; large discrepancies in axis score coupled with a poor percentage agreement usually result from failures in the location or orientation of plots whilst similar shifts in quadrat pairs with reasonably high levels of concordance usually stem from gross mis-matches in the cover awarded to diagnostic species.  Example: the X-plot pair marked with an * in Figure 1a had very good general concurrence of species but in CS2000 Lolium multiflorum (not recorded at T2) was awarded very high cover  whilst Agrostis stolonifera (not noted at T1 ) was awarded similarly high cover by the assessors.  Changes in mean axis score  32  33  When the ordination is conducted using an amalgamation of sample pairs from all plot types, the mean axis one scores for CS2000 and for the QA exercise are 387.8 and 392.0 respectively. An Analysis of Variance shows no significant difference between the two times and the probability value, using the Bartlett Test, is 0.847. There is thus no evidence of any directional bias in the  variations between the original survey and the QA.  The changes in mean axis score for the individual plot types between CS2000 and the QA are  displayed in Table 8.  Table 8.

The results parallel those shown for the entire data set; no plot type shows a significant difference in the principal axis score between the two sets of records. The plot data from the ordination may be partitioned into four landclass aggregates rather than analysed by plot type. The aggregates, with their identifiers are:  LG: landclasses dominated by arable-growing areas of the lowlands  LG landclasses dominated by lowland grasslands MA: landclasses in marginal areas UP.  landclasses in the uplands The results of such a grouping are summarised in Table 9.  Table 9. Changes in mean Axis score by landclass; CS2000 v QA exercise  (Figures in brackets are the number of quadrat pairs in each class)  oT  ANOVA: Variable P Time 0.741 Landclass 0.000  Time*Landclass 1.000  The results demonstrate that though the plots in one landclass occupy a very different position on the gradient, represented by axis one of the ordination, from those of other landclasses, there is no significant different in the position of the CS2000 plots from those of the QA in any  landclass; there is again no evidence of a directional bias.  20 General 35  36  37  38  The coding of landcover and boundary features. Though the results derived from the assessment of concordance in the recording of plot types provide the more rigorous estimates of the reliability of the CS2000 field work, the mapping element forms a major part of the survey and an attempt has been made to provide an objective  assessment of this work.  The efficiency of mapping can be tested in three ways. The frequency of primary codes can provide a population estimate which will indicate any overall discrepancy in the units mapped. The accuracy of mapping at a particular point can be gauged by matching the primary code awarded by the assessors at the point location with the code given by the CS2000 surveyors for the parcel of land in which the point is located. These first two approaches are combined in the tables presented for primary and qualifying code types. The third test is that of change since 1990 and the extent to which this has been recorded and apportioned between real change and the correction of original (1990) mis-coding. The accuracy of change in Countryside Survey  codes is considered in paragraphs 39 et.seq.  CS 2000 survey involves the reporting of change  1. by broad habitat categories  2. by more detailed coding of land cover using the established Countryside Survey reporting categories and  3: through a comprehensive examination of boundary features using a combination of previously existing codes and additional categories introduced to assess hedge and wall  management.  The monitoring of the mapping element of CS2000 follows that adopted in the 1991 Quality Assurance exercise of the 1990 Countryside Survey; the revised protocol used is given in Annex A.  In each of the 38 squares visited, one quarter of the area was selected, usually the south-east quarter, and nine regularly spaced points marked on the map of the square. At each point features of the land cover and of the nearest boundary (if within 100m of the point) were recorded using exactly the same methodology as that of the original surveyors. The code strings produced for cach point were compared, in the field, with those generated during the 1990 survey so as to check the changes that had occurred. For the four new squares assessed where no change element was involved the field comparison was made directly with the code strings and  BAP categories assigned by the CS2000 surveyors.  21 Primary land cover codes 39. Table 10 presents the results of the comparison of primary land cover codes awarded. (+) indicates concordance between the coding of CS2000 and the assessors at a point  (-) indicates a discrepancy.  The final column contains the codes given by the CS2000 surveyors where these differ from those of the assessors. Values in brackets indicate the number of times that a specific mis-match  occurred, The complete list of CS2000 codes is given as Annex C.  Table 10.

In the great majority of instances the surveyors were both where they thought they were and coded the parcel sensibly. In a very few instances, as where a Lolium-tich pasture was coded as BAP 8 (Acid grassland) or where a barley field was coded as the nearby park there were errors of location. The complete mis-match of codes 120 and 121 isa quirk of the relatively small sample size - in two lowland arable squares sugar beet was recorded  as turnips (possibly by the same pair of surveyors).  41 When the results for the assessment of the BAP codes (Table 11) are included in the calculation  of concordance the overall values are:  22 CS 2000  Total concordance (excluding BAP codes) 91.6% BAP concurrence 774%  Overall primary land cover agreement 87.5%  This compares favorably with the figure of 84.3% calculated for the efficiency of this portion of the 1990 CS survey. The modest increase in percentage concordance is probably due to the telative ease of assigning BAP codes rather than the more troublesome unenclosed primary vegetation codes used previously. The main disparity between the assignment of BAP codes lay, predictably, between BAP 10, dwarf shrub heath and BAP 12, Bog. Areas of both dry and wet heath occurred, not infrequently, within larger areas of blanket or other bog - there was a tendency, largely inherited from previous surveys, to map large areas as bog and to ignore the presence within them of lenses of heath. The 1990 boundaries between BAP types should have been amended in more instances than was the case to more accurately reflect the true  distribution of broad habitat types.  Table 11.

The overall concordance (63.0%) is better than might have been expected though this is due largely to the prevalence at the sample points of Lolium perenne-rich swards which are, in general, easy to identify. Marked differences were evident in the level of concurrence for the recording of other species. Thus, Jrifolium repens was less often awarded cover by the assessors than by the surveyors and its level of concordance (35.5%) was low. There seemed to be a tendency to retain the high clover cover recorded in 1990 often, in the view of the QA team, uncritically. Much closer agreement (62.5%) between surveyors and assessors with regard to clover cover was evident in 1990-1. The 1990-91 agreement for Agrostis capillaris (57.1%) was thought to be rather disappointing: by the present survey this rather modest percentage concordance had been halved (to 28.6%). The records for Bromus hordeaceus and Vulpia bromoides almost certainly reflect a seasonal element in the  sward and might justifiably be removed from the comparison.  23 Table 12.

In this presentation, as m some subsequent tables, a distinction is drawn between two forms of non-concordance: values in brackets indicate that the assessors awarded a code which was omitted by the CS2000 surveyors. Thus, under code 193 [silage] there was concurrence in 22 cases but in a further five instances the assessors also noted silage whilst no equivalent code for use was entered by the surveyors. Values in other boxes indicate disparities in the awarding of codes: continuing the example provided by code 193, the assessors used the silage code on six other occasions; these points were coded as hay [194] by the surveyors in two instances, sheep pastures[189] (once) and beef cattle pasturage [185] (three times). Conversely, reading across the rows rather than down the columns, it is seen that on five other occasions it was the surveyors who recorded silage whilst the assessors noted sheep pasture [189] at the areas of all  of these points. The overall concurrence for these cover qualifiers was 71.9%. Since 17.3% of the discrepancies  are accounted for by omissions from the surveyors code strings, it is seen that where both  CS2000 and QA used a relevant code the actual code agreement was 89.2%. This is a  25 remarkably high value especially since seasonal changes will have occurred between survey and assessment in stock type and where fields are shut up for hay/silage. The 1991 QA produced a figure for concordance of primary cover quakiiying codes of 75.0%. This is equivalent to the sum of species cover codes plus cover qualifiers in CS2000; if these two sets are amalgamated  for the current QA, the values for the two surveys are very similar  eS e  Landuse primary qualifying code concordance  26 Lz  fever [oer | ver | ewe | ove | ove | 89e | coe | 99e | cor | vor | cor [or] ost [ey] os |] si | juoussassy YO  *saatyenb ad} 19A0D “pT aque,  0002 SD Primary boundary codes.  47  48  An even greater level of consistency between —s of Countryside Surveys is demonstrated when the results for concordance between survey and quality assurance assessments of primary boundary features are compared  The values for the CS2000 survey and for its assessment are given in Table 15. The matrix is in the same form as that introduced in Table 14 in the foregoing section. Code 410 [embankment] is included in the matrix since both surveyors and assessors independently used it as a boundary  type even though it is technically an ‘area’ feature.  In summary: Total concordance 85.0% CS2000 omissions 7.0%  Code concordance 92.0%  The value of 85.0% concordance compares with a figure of 85.8% derived for the same comparison in the 1991 QA of the CS1990 survey !  The commonest discrepancy in the coding of primary boundaries involves code 323, mixed hedge, with CS2000 awarding the code to 19 boundary sections compared to 24 by the assessors. Rather more significantly, the surveyors recorded boundaries on five occasions when the assessors noted that the feature was no longer present - evidence of an occasional ‘Friday afternoon’ disposition on the part of the surveyors to tick the 1990 code without checking it for  change (see paragraph 54).  28 AROS ae] het) nad) + —_ —  QA Assessment  - _ 2 nN aed S Oat  x So ow  Q (on aed wo} se] 5/2 S Lae PEPE A :  0007 SD  31] 12  302  301 311 313 314 321 322 323 331 333  Table 15.

The overall veneendanie for this series of codes was 67.5% with 14.8% of the mis-matches seemingly attributable to omissions from the code string by the surveyors.  The introduction of new codes [374-380] to partition hedge shapes appears to have been only a limited success; most hedges in the sample squares could be accommodated within code 374, box-shaped hedge, but in a substantial number of instances the CS2000 surveyors omitted any code for hedge shape. A more intriguing mis-match was that between codes 306 and 307 which relate to the condition of dry stone walls. The assessors tended to use code 306 ‘sound and stockproof with minor defects’ where CS2000 surveyors classed the same section of wall as 307; ‘major signs of advancing or potential deterioration’ but still stock proof. The only explanation which comes to mind is the assessors long association with North West Wales where any wall not approaching dereliction is considered to be perfectly adequate; the same wall in the  Cotswolds would probably be classed as a pile of stones.  Height and stockproof nature of boundaries.  50  31  The two small Tables 17 (a) and (b) present the matrix of agreement for these features.

There were, inevitably, some differences of opinion conceming the stockproof nature of boundaries but there was no evidence of bias towards one type or the other by surveyors or assessors; the former rated 74.3% of boundaries as stockproof  whilst the equivalent figure produced by the assessors was 75.6%.

Recording of change, 1990 - 1998.  53 A sample of instances of alterations to the 1990 code string involving changes made either by the CS2000 surveyors or by the assessors was analysed in order to test the level of agreement in the nature of boundary and landcover fluctuations.  The following recorded changes were not included in the sample: changes in stock type or number alterations to species cover unless of a magnitude as to differ by two cover bands e.g. 175 to 177 or vice versa changes in tree age or canopy proportions changes in boundary height unless by two code bands changes in physiographic features  The sample contained 177 instances of change: of these 29 (16.4%) were considered by the  assessors to reflect errors or omissions in the 1990 survey.

The surveyors seemed reluctant to indicate changes where CS1990 strings contained incorrect codes or where codes had been omitted from the 1990 strings. Of the 29 instances where the assessors considered change to be other than real only five were unambiguously so recorded by the surveyors though 16 of the cases were recorded as changes, the remaining 13  being missed.  32 For example, the two instances where a 1990 mixed hedge [323] has been recorded as a hawthorn hedge [321] seem very likely to have arisen from original miscodings (in neither case was the hedge newly planted). Though it is conceivable that the reverse change could have occurred over eight years, the change from mixed to hawthorn dominance seems unlikely in the extreme and the 323 code should have been circled. It seems that, contrary to the expectation that most changes would be analysed in the field, there will be a requirement for a considerable degree of interpretation during data entry. Of greater concern is the indication that, if the assessed sample is representative of the survey as a whole and the assessment reasonably accurate, a substantial proportion of the changes that have occurred since 1990 will have been missed and that it will be the plot data which provide the more reliable basis for the evaluation  of change.  33 Annex A.

Introduction 1. This paper outlines the scope of the quality assurance carried out in  connection with the 1990 Countryside Survey, presents the results and includes a series of recommendations in accordance with the aims of the  exercise, Background 2. It 1s recognised that in a field investigation on the scale of the  Countryside Survey the large numbers of recorders and surveyors involved must produce an inherent’ degree of variation despite the provision of a training course, a field: handbook and on-site visits by supervisors (Quality Control). Whilst thére is no reason to expect any directional bias in the records made, nor was any subsequently demonstrated, it is important to attempt a measure of the consistency and reliability of the work done within the major components of the field programme (Quality Assurance).  3. In August 1989, during the preparatory phase of the survey, an exercise was conducted whereby a group of field workers were invited both to independently assess the vegetation of a pair of fixed quadrats and to Similarly record plots which they were required to find on the basis of crosses marked on a standard map at 1:7500 scale. The results are presented in Hallam and Bunce (1991). The experience gained during this exercise was used during the subsequent training course. Pairs of surveyors were tested on their ability to record both fixed and relocated plots of the types to be used in the main survey. Results for this and for a similar exercise carried out as a trial QA exercise based on the 1988 partial Countryside survey (Wallace and Prosser 1990) are compared with the findings from the most recent field programme and presented and discussed later, (See Table 6 and Para. 26).  4. The difficulties associated with the use of cover estimates derived from a range of recorders has been highlighted by Sykes et. al. (1983) but the broader aspects of plot relocation by teams, bias in species recognition and the effects of such variation on the validity of ecological generalisations has been largely ignored in previous surveys.  Aims  5. (a) To quantify the accuracy of field recording in the Countryside Survey 1990 and to comment on the accuracy of change statistics.  (b) To explain any differences in recording in terms of observer error, time of year, plot location, type of information, geographical region and special factors such as drought. (c) To relate the conclusions from (a) and (b) to previous comparative work done on ITE survey methods.  (d) To recommend modifications to survey methodology for future surveys which will improve the accuracy and confidence of the resulting  statistics. Methods 6. Two separate series of assessments have been carried out. The first,  conducted during October-November 1990, and restricted, by the time available, to 21 of the original survey squares, relied only on the sketch maps of the original surveyors for plot relocation. The work was divided between two independent pairs of assessors. The second phase, during June-September 1991, tested the potential improvement to be gained through the use, in addition, of photographs of individual plots.  7. In 1991 the assessors were provided with a single 1km square from each of the original 32 terrain classes. As an additional exercise in self assessment a group of squares originally surveyed by one or both of the assessors was included in the trial. The 1991 itinerary was so arranged that each 1km square was visited within 14 days of the corresponding Original survey date; 28 of the 32 squares were visited by a single pair of assessors. Details of the 1991 QA itinerary form Annex A.  8. One quarter of each square was resurveyed so as to include one of each of the plot types represented in the whole square. The six plot types used in the 1990 Countryside Survey can be sub-divided into;  Quadrats: 200m2 (X-plots, after Bunce and Shaw 1973) m2 (Y-plots)  Linear plots, all 10x1m which include;  Roadverges, commencing adjacent to and parallel with the carriageway. A second parallel strip was originally surveyed in the case of wide verges (not included in the QA exercise). Hedges, running parallel with the hedge line and commencing at the mid-point of the hedge.  Streamsides, from normal water level or at the lower limit of vegetation cover in the case of water courses with extensive gravel or pebble beds etc.  Boundaries, in enclosed land only; recorded at the boundary marker (plate) associated with the 200m” X-plot.  An attempt was made in each case to relocate the buried metal plate marking one corner of each quadrat using the original sketch map, the surveyors photograph and a metal detector. The plot was recorded using the standard Countryside Survey 1990 procedure in accordance with the Field Handbook. In addition, the landcover and boundary features were recorded at 9 pre-determined points on a grid within the selected quarter of the square. A synopsis of the methods forms Annex B. a  =m mee nwichees  Plate relocation  9.  Table  The plot may often be accurately relocated on the basis of the sketch map measurements and a good photograph. However, it was considered important to investigate the effectiveness with which the plates themselves could be physically relocated (Table 1).  1.

Three categories of performance were recognised with respect to the relocation of original plots within a square:  (i) Plate, and hence plot, relocated  (ii) Plate not found, or no plate used, but assessor satisfied that location of resurvey adequately matched original location.  (iii) Plate not found; information insufficient to allow satisfactory relocation of plot.  Species concordance  11.  A variety of measures may be used to compare aggregate records made for the same plot at different times. Four indices are used in this report and are defined as follows:  (i) Percentage (%) agreement: common species divided by the aggregate of species at time 1 (T1) plus time 2 (T2). The simplest, crudest, but most objective value.  (ii) T1 agreement: common species divided by the total recorded at T2. This index removes species believed to have been erroneously  recorded during the original survey.  (iii) T2 agreement: common species divided by the total recorded at T1, The corollary of T1 agreement whereby the initial recording is regarded as the more correct. 14.  (iv) % accuracy: Common species divided by total species minus T2 errors. This is intended to remove variations due to e.g. season, management change, plot mis-orientation etc. (See para. 20).  The overall concordance given by indices i, ii and iii for individual squares forms Annex C. Percentage accuracy by square is given in Table  5, following Para. 25.  An initial exercise carried out by I. Taylor at Merlewood on a selection of the first assessment results indicated that;  (i) the mean number of species recorded at T1 (22.77) and T2 (22.72) was virtually identical,  (ii) the overall % agreement = 452,  (iii) the variation could be partitioned as follows;  A+D~ Mis-identification 10% B+tI Species overlooked on one occasion 33% C+G Error in plot location a 37% E Changes in management of plot 3% F Temporal differences 5% H+ J Mis-alignment of plot 122%  The prefix letters will be referred to below.  The exercise referred to above was limited to an analysis of the results from 12 squares and compares the species complement of a plot in summer with that in late autumn where fewer species might be present and identifiable.  A subsequent analysis of the full data set (21 squares) gives an overall percentage agreement of 47.1.  The results have also been recalculated after subtracting those records for common species present in the original survey which would not have been available for recording during the October QA. Examples: Ranunculus ficaria, Conopodium majus, Hyacinthoides non-scripta, Arum maculatum, Bromus sterilis etc.  Out of a total of 2148 species records made in the original survey it is considered that 88 would not have been recorded during the QA due to this seasonal difference (c.3.5%). If these records are deleted from the comparison, the differences in mean number of species per plot recorded becomes;  Original survey 20.2 Autumn QA 20.9  This suggests that the assessors were recording 3.5% more species per plot than were the original surveyors.  The results of the 1991 assessment are presented in Table 2 below.  Although the increases in mean species number evident from the results for each plot type were not statistically significant, when the sample size is increased by the pooling of all plots a highly significant increase in species number between the original survey and the 1991 re~ assessment is demonstrated. ===  ! ] ] ! | | i  j i i  i  ! |  Table 2 Comparison of species numbers per plot 1990 v 1991.

Wilcoxon Matched Pairs; full data set; z2=3.86, p <0.001  Since, in the extended 1991 QA exercise, the same assessors were surveying the plots recorded by the same set of surveyors there is no reason to suppose that the relative efficiency of recording would have changed. Therefore, the indication is that the 13% increase in species per plot found during the 1991 QA (see Table 2) is largely due to real differences in the species complement of the plots. Using the value for efficiency of recording derived above (para. 14) from the 1990 QA exercise, it would seem that c.27% of the species increase can be attributed to a greater efficiency of recording by the assessors and the residual 73% to this real increase in species per plot in the 1991 growing season compared with the same plots in 1990.  Some progress on the nature of the change in species number has been made through a simple comparison of the self-assessment plots. These plots, all in the southern half of Britain and surveyed in summer 1990 and summer 1991, give the following results:  N Species number 1990% C.Vv 1990 1991 1990 1991 42 22.8 24.7 92.4 41.6 39.1 0.37  This again suggests that annual variation is contributing more to the change in species number than is any effect of recorder experience; the figures indicate that under-recording during the initial survey may account for 30% of the difference (or c.3% of the total species record) whilst 70% may be attributable to a difference between the drought year of 1990 and the comparatively normal growing season of 1991.  Thus evidence from both QA exercises point to a similar real increase in species numbers between the two years and show that much of the variation within category B (species overlooked) of the original survey was spurious.  However, the situation is less straight forward than is demonstrated by this simple approach. If there is a marked difference due to the effect of the 1990 drought, then the values for species per plot for the two years should be very similar in those wet, upland, unenclosed plots not subject to drought. This is not so. When a comparison is made of species per plot in the unenclosed lands of the uplands, the values obtained emetic ee  es  eer  eure ree  are; 1990 1991 Total species record 825 952  Mean species per plot 27.5 31.7  As the values show these are species-rich plots. It seems that in such diverse vegetation there is liable to be a diminution in the efficiency of recording by the average surveyor. The species record is required to include common and characteristic bryophytes and lichens. It is in Lhese moist, semi-natural habitats that this element becomes pronounced; bryophytes were in general less well recorded than were vascular plants. It is relevant to note here that during the autumn QA a different pair of assessors visited a sample of the species-rich plots of this group in late October with the following outcome:  Original October 1990  survey Total species record 586 616 Mean species per plot 32.6 34.2  Even at this late stage of the season cxpericnced assessors were recording more species per plot than the summer values for the original survey. These findings emphasise the difficulty of making generalisations on the accuracy of change statistics across different plot types and in different land classes and demonstrate the need to restrict comparisons of change in species number to areas of similar landuse e.g. arable land, permanent pastures, marginal area, uplands, etc. They also emphasise the need for caution when comparing records made by surveyors with varying levels of field experience.  Recommendation 1. The list of bryophytes and lichens to be recorded should be  20.  21.  retained for general survey, perhaps with minor modifications. During future training courses samples of each species, together with habitat information, should be available for study and familiarisation.  Notwithstanding the results of the 1990 re-assessment, an attempt has heen made to apportion sources of error between the original survey and the 1991 QA. This includes a distinction between the lack of agreement due to inadequate recording at the time of initial survey (T1 variations) and changes not so attributable (12 variations).  Within each category, sub-divisions have been erected so as to more satisfactorily apportion individual discrepancies within T1 and T2.  The categories used are as follows:  T1 variations  A) Apparent mis-identifications or mis-codings The former are usually apparent. However, there have certainly been instances where the wrong box has been ticked, e.g. in the adjacent pair Angelica sylvestris and Anthriscus sylvestris, Primula vulgaris and Prunella vulgaris. [esesnen: I mere ne  B) Species considered to have been overlooked at T1.  As the season progressed the assessors became increasingly convinced that many species showed an altered profile between the two seasons especially in the more drought-affected lowland squares. Since in many instances individual changes could not be proven, the lack of such species at T1 has been classified as a T1 error. In consequence the apparent error in this category has undoubtedly been over-estimated. Among the more apparent examples of year on year population changes encountered are the annuals Galium aparine, Geranium robertianum and Lapsana communis, the biennial Alliaria petiolata and more surprisingly the perennials of the Taraxacum aggregate.  mw GE Go  C) Overzealous recording During the QA particular care was taken to restrict recording to the exact plot size stipulated. It appears that in some cases the initial surveyors had either not adequately measured the plot or had included species adjacent to but not strictly within the defined area.  pean  J) Inadmissible records due to a combination of the positioning otf the original plot in a way which did not correspond with the standard protocol and failure to note this on the sketch.  D) Mysteries. Species records, apparently incorrect, for which no reasonable explanation could be found.  T2 variations  E) Species change due to change in management Change in crop between years, use of herbicide sprays, vehicle erosion etc.  F) Species change due to seasonal effects. Partially overlaps with E, i.e. different suites of annual herbs in differing crops; many other changes apparent amongst ephemerals on drier banks and annual herbs such as those in hedgerows.  G) Mis-match of records through failure to exactly relocate plot at T2.  H) Locational mis~matches where plot location was  refound but orientation or alignment probably differed markedly from the original.  I) Species present but overlooked at T2.  The protocol adopted at T2 was as follows: the plot was relocated from the map, sketch map and photograph, and recorded 'blind'. After completion of the record the original data sheet was examined and a fresh search made to deal with apparent discrepancies. Species subsequently found but not initially recorded were classed | as 'I' errors.  22. It is very probable that many records ascribed to T1 errors are in | reality the results of seasonal and/or management changes which could not be directly demonstrated (see Paras. 3 and 17). In Tables 3 and 4 below Variation B will result in an initial under-recording of species whilst Variation C (directly) and I (indirectly) will inflate the figures for species records. Since it is clear that 'B' errors are greater than the sum of 'C' plus 'I', the overall effect is to produce an under-estimate during the initial survey.  Recommendation 2. Future QA exercises should be carried out as close as is  a  practical to the initial time of survey.  mismatches 4 T ws * Ti%*xx T1 Variations Type A Mis ID 3.04 0.57 B Overlooked 14.58 9.94 C Over zealous 2.76 1.30 D Mysteries 1.28 0.48 J Incorrect positioning 1.89 nil 2 Variations E Management 0.98 2.53 F Season 7.11 11.57 G Plot mis-location 1.86 1.79 H Plot mis-orientation 5.22 4.65 I Overlooked 1.43 3.59 I * assessments of 28 squares originally surveyed by other surveyors  II ** assessments of 7 squares originally surveyed by one or both of the assessors themselves.  23.

Table  26.  The percentage agreement is thus 60.9; this compares very favourably with the 45% suggested by the partial analysis of the autumn 1990 QA, (See para. 12). It also accords well with the findings of Kirby et. al. (1986) who give a range of 47-62 for percentage agreement between Species lists for woodland 'X' plots relocated from sketch maps by different observers at different seasons of the same year.  T2 variations can be removed from the calculation to give an initial efficiency of recording (% accuracy); this original accuracy of recording of the 1990 survey averages 74% (See Table 5). This approaches the value of 79% given as the maximum attainable efficiency between standardised searches by experienced field workers in Nilsson and Nilsson (1985).  5.

The comparisons include a mixture of 'X' plots and linear plots and represent both ‘lowland' and ‘upland' situations. In this and in subsequent analyses plot data were partitioned into four Land Class aggregates following the practice adopted during the ECOLOC project whereby:  LC: land classes dominated by the arable-growing areas of the lowlands  LG: land classes dominated by lowland grasslands  MA: land classes in marginal areas  UP: land classes in the uplands  LC plus LG and MA plus UP were also considered as representative of ‘lowland’ and 'upland' situations respectively.

Trial 6, in which both seasonal and locational errors are eliminated, indicates the level of recording immediately prior to the start of the survey. It may be compared with the 74% accuracy measured for the full QA exercise (see Para. 25). The improvement may reflect a combination of the surveyors increasing familiarity with the methods and_ the opportunity to make subsequent identifications of material collected from plots during actual fieldwork; an opportunity not available during the observer bias experiment itself. Comparisons of the other results show the dramatic improvement associated with the use of photographs to re-establish the exact position of plots and, to a lesser but still marked extent, the effect of seasonal and annual changes in depressing the level of agreement between records [or individual plots.  Further analysis of the sources of error within individual plot types and a comparison of enclosed versus unenclosed situations is useful for the planning of further training courses, surveys, etc.  A breakdown of the main sources of error by plot type, with a further  sub-division into lowland (LC + LG) and upland (MA + UP) landclasses is given below [Table 7].  10 Table 7.

An analysis of variance of the 1991 QA exercise by plot type and landclass shows no significant difference in the % accuracy achieved in the individual survey between plot types but a highly significant difference between landclass aggregates:  F P Plot 1.003 0.418 NS Landclass aggregate 10.56 0.001 weK Interaction 0.87 0.565 NS Notes: percentage accuracy is arrived at by eliminating T2  variations which are due largely to errors in plot location (see Para. 11). X plots which have undergone a change of crop have been excluded from the analysis.  The effect demonstrated is due to a significantly lower degree of accuracy in the recording of those plots falling in the lowland arable landclasses (LC); the other classes have all been recorded at approximately the same level of efficiency. The reasons for the comparatively poor performance in the most lowland squares are unclear but may include a lower overall level of experience amongst the surveyors involved, a generally greater level of species diversity in lowland squares and a greater short-term species flux especially in arable areas.  The recording of vegetation cover  33.  34.  As an integral part of the original recording schedule, surveyors were required to give visual estimates for cover for any species perceived to exceed 5% cover in a plot. These estimates were repeated during the QA. The comparison of cover values presented in Table 8 matches estimates made in all plots where the species was recorded as present at both  times of survey. ,  Although the table below shows only two species, Holcus lJanatus and Poa trivialis, to have been recorded at significantly different covers in the original survey and the assessment, several other significant differences are apparent when Lhe dala are sub divided into lowland, marginal and upland groups of squares.  Cover estimates by landclass aggregate, for a selection of relevant species, are presented as Annex D.  12 Plots having the species recorded at both T1 and T2.

Although there are almost 40% of species mis-matches when direct comparisons are made between individual pairs of plots it might be expected that these differences would, for many of the commoner individual species, average out over a large number of plots. To test this assumption the frequencies of all species recorded have been compared for the 1990 survey and the subsequent full re-assessment.  36. A comparison of the frequencies of the most prevalent species across al] terrain classes is presented in Table 9.  Table 9.

It is not possible to apportion the reasons for individual discrepancies with any confidence but the following points may be made.  (i) The apparent increases in Taraxacum spp., Gallium aparine and Cirsium arvense along with similar increases in frequency for the less prevalent species Lapsana communis and Alliaria petiolata do appear to reflect a genuine change in the populations of these species between the two years of survey.  (ii) In contrast, the apparent changes in Lolium perenne and Poa trivialis seem to result from under-recording during the initial survey; Poa trivialis across all plot types and Lolium in more marginal and upland situations.  (iii) Of the less prevalent species only Holcus mollis appears to have been consistently over-recorded in the original survey. Kirby also refers to an inconsistency ot distinction between Holcus mollis and H.lanatus in his observer bias trials.  Recommendation 6. One aspect of future training courses should involve a  concentration on the field characteristics which serve to distinguish the members of similar taxa with emphasis on vegetative identification of common grasses.  Overall effects of species change  Marked changes in apparent species composition have been demonstrated for individual plots of all types. In order to assess the effects of this variation on the plots as a whole the quadrats have been arranged on a continuum using the first axis of a DECORANA analysis (Hill 1979) as the gradient. All pairs of quadrats of a single plot type from the original survey and from the 1991 re-assessment have been pooled. For each pair the change in axis score has been plotted against the percentage agreement in species complement at the two times of survey. The assumption to be tested is that, though the axis scores for individual pairs may shift markedly due to e.g. a change in management between years or a failure to accurately relocate a particular plot, the results for the two total records should form a single population with little or no overall shift in mean axis score.  The resulting graphs for individual plot types form Figure 1.  Three plot types are represented in the Figure; those omitted, hedge, boundary and roadverge plots show a very similar distribution of points. A 50 unit change in First AXIS score has been taken as a purely arbitrary level above which reasons are sought for the discrepancy between Time 1 and Time 2 records. No single cause for large discrepancies is evident; four causes of variation contribute to the scatter of points; crop change, problems of plot relocation, failures in Species recording during the original survey and disparity in the awarding of cover values for species recorded. (Variations due to the latter are notable in woodland plots. The field handbook states ‘cover of tree species should be put in parentheses’; surveyors were not consistent in their attitude to cover resulting from species not  obviously rooted in the plot. )  14 40  41.  Table  42.  Recommendation 7. Recording of tree and shrub cover should be dealt with more  explicitly in handbooks and training courses. Rules should also be adopted for the use of such data in subsequent analyses.  Percentage agreement has been selected as the X-axis since it demonstrates the full extent of variation between pairs of quadrats. Thus, the cluster of open circles to the LHS of the 'X' plot graph results largely from changes between cereal and other arable crops over the two years. Different crops are accompanied by different suites of arable weeds and in consequence there may be a high level of mis~match which only infrequently results in an appreciable shift along the axis.  With the exception of the hedge data, the Eigenvalue for the first axis was uniformly high and the gradient between the acid soils of the uplands and the possibly more nutrient-rich lowlands was strong.  Hedges are nol prevalent in the uplands and, perhaps in consequence of the inevitable 'clumping' of the data, even the first axis Eigenvalue was low (0.54) and correlation between axes was marked. The first axis appeared to reflect a gradient between shade intolerant and _ shade tolerant species.  When the shift in median position of axis 1 is calculated it is seen to range for the different plot types as shown in Table 10.  10. Plot type Median shift in Direction of axis score change  "x! 0.3 units towards 'lowland' Verges 4.1 units towards 'lowland' Streams 4.3 units towards 'lowland' ‘y' 4.4 units towards 'lowland' Boundaries 5.1 units towards ‘lowland’ Hedges 5.3 units towards 'shade'  The preliminary results for changes in mean axis score as distinct from changes in median position, together with a comparison the coefficients of variance, are presented in Table 11.  Although the shift in the ecological gradient is always in the same direction the polarity of the axis is arbitrary. Hence, the uplands may attract either the highest or lowest scores in an individual analysis. Since the range of first axis scores varies markedly between analyses for individual plot types no direct comparison may be made between then.  15 ee  Table 11.

An analysis of variance, using pooled data from all plot types, by year,  44,  45.  landclass aggregate and level of interaction between these two variables with respect to mean first axis score demonstrates no significant difference either between 1990 and 1991 or any interaction between year and landclass aggregate. However, the mean axis score for the aggregate UP differs significantly from those of all other landclass aggregates. This reflects the very distinctive and stable vegetation of the moors, heaths and bogs which have been little influence by changes in recent agricultural practices.  The results are summarised below:  Mean Axis score ANOVA Landclass 1990 1991 QA Variable p aggregate Year 0.923 LC 492 492 Landclass 0.001 LG 466 466 Year*Landclass 1.000 MA 455 460 UP 292 299  The overall axis shift between 1990 and 1991, though insufficient to be significant at this relatively small sample size, parallells that previously demonstrated during the ECOLUC project. To what extent the 1990-1991 results reinforce the changes previously demonstrated or are evidence of a singular climatic shift between the two individual seasons cannot at present be established with certainty.  That both factors are operating is suggested by the results of a further DECORANA analysis. A comparison has been made of the 50 plots, comprising 'X'’ plots, roadverges, hedges and streamsides, for which data were available for three time periods; the 1978 survey, the 1990 survey and the 1991 QA exercise. When the quadrat data are pooled in a single analysis and the first axis scores are compared for each plot at each time the following axis shifts (Table 12) are produced.  16 Table 12.

In contrast, the temporary reversal ot the trend in the less intensively farmed areas may illustrate the effect of annual variation (possibly an enhanced effect of drought on the more  | susceptible vegetation of marginal areas) which is likely to cause year to year perturbations within the general trend.  Performance of species groups  46. In addition to the performance of individual species and to changes in the total complement of a given plot, changes in the cumulative frequency of species groups is of interest in the context of landuse change. In a preliminary exercise a group of 10 species has been selected from each plot type (15 in the case of 'Y' plots), their frequencies summed for each of the two years under examination and a simple 't' test performed to establish whether the overall frequency of the members of a group has differed significantly. The species chosen in each case are selected as being representative of the central portion of the relevant species ordination. Any change in frequency in these ‘conservative’ species would provide strong evidence for a significant landuse change.  47. The results are presented below.

The mapping of agricultural landuse and the distribution of natural vegetation  48,  49.  This involves the use of a series of codes which may, for the purpose of analysis, be sub-divided into three groups;  (i) Primary codes: major habitat and crop types,  (ii) Secondary descriptive codes: relate to stock and variations in land management,  (iii) Cover codes: a further characterisation of a given parcel of land using a combination of the mapping of the most prevalent species together with a code denoting the cover of each.  The efficiency of mapping can be tested in two ways. The frequency of primary codes can provide a population estimate which will indicate any overall discrepancy in the units mapped. The accuracy of mapping at a  18 particular point can be gauged by matching the primary code awarded by the assessors at a point location with the code given in the original survey for the parcel of land in which the point is located.  50- A comparison of the frequency of use of primary landuse codes is  presented in Table 13.  Table 13. The Number of times individual primary codes are assigned  Lowland square Upland square Total  Primary code 1990 1991 1990 1991 1990 1991  101 77 76 30 30 107 106  Arable codes 43 42 0 ) 43 42  111 0 0 26 24 26 24  104 0 0 23 21 23 21  102 1 0 14 10 15 10  105 4 4 0 0 4 4  114 0 3 1 4 1 7  109 1 1 0 0 1 1  103 0 0 2 6 2 6  112 0 0 2 3 2 3  115 0 0 5 5 5 5  Total 126 126 103 103 229 229  51. It is clear that the allocation of primary codes to the principal types of landuse and of natural vegetation cover is very reliable. The minor categories occur with such limited frequency that the sampling is insufficient to adequately test the effectiveness of the original recording.  52. When point by point comparisons are made over the grid of sample points  for each square assessed the general results show a very high level of agreement for the lowland areas and a greater variability in the interpretation of upland vegetation (See Table 14). Some of the latter may be due to problems of location in unenclosed land.  Table 14. Pair-wise comparisons of primary codes  Lowland Upland Overall Primary codes 120 73 193 concurring Primary codes 6 30 36 not-concurring Percentage agreement 95.22 70.9% 84.3% 53. An extended comparison sf the use of codes, both for landuse and for  boundary features, has been made using the data from all squares where a three-way comparison is possible i.e. those squares which were either | re-surveyed both in autumn 1990 and in summer 1991 by the same pair of  | 19 =a = oo  54.  assessors, or were re-visited on the two occasions by different pairs of assessors. The results are summarised in Table 15.  Points arising: (i) The overall concordance between landuse primary codes (88.7%) is Similar to that shown for the initial exercise presented in Table 14  (84.3%).  (ii) The equivalent concordance for the primary codes used to describe boundary features is slightly lower (80.3%) and yet is noticeably inflated by the high level of agreement resulting from the same assessors re~visiting the same squares in both autumn 1990 and summer 1991. (The 1990 data were not referred to in the subsequent survey so both the location of the point on the grid and its assessment were independent on the two occasions).  (iii) The reasonably good agreement in the use of Level 1 qualifiers, 79% for landuse and 83% in the case of boundaries, together with the concordance for primary codes reflects the product of two opposing trends in the survey: the conscientiousness of the surveyors (there was virtually no evidence of guess work) and the level of interpretation residing in the codes provided despite the great efforts made to furnish unique definitions for each code.  (iv) The remarkable similarity in overall performance shown in Comparison 2 emphasises this element of interpretation: there was no real difference in the use of codes between pairs of assessors and between assessors and surveyors. Unlike the situation in species recording within quadrats, the assessors proved themselves to be very average surveyors with respect to the use of mapping codes.  Level 1 versus Level 2 agreement.  The large number of available codes, especially in connection with boundary features, make adequate comparisons of T1 and T2 mapping difficult. ‘the approach adopted is best illustrated with a simple example.  A typical pair of code combinations for a survey point might be:  Original survey QA Code 321 Hedge, 50% hawthorn 321 342 <2m high 342 351 Stockproof Not stockproof 352 353 Filled gaps <10% - - Trimmed 357 Laying 361 This would translate in Table 15 as; Primary code agreement J Qualifying codes Agreement at Level 1 J Xx (50%) Agreement at Level 2 (20%) since, of a  total of six qualifying codes used, one was common to both records, one pair represented a mismatch, one was noted at T1 but not T2 and two appeared at T2 but were absent at the T1 record.  20 Table 15.

Despite the thoroughness with which the Field Handbook of the 1990 Countryside Survey was compiled it is clear that confusion remained in the allocating of some codes. Two sources of variation were apparent; (i) inversions of particular pairs of codes and  (ii) difficulties of interpretation of some qualifying codes.  With respect to the first source of variation, the commonest primary landuse codes, the collection of arable codes and 101 = lowland agricultural grassland were clear, unambiguous and were, in consequence, mapped with a very high level of accuracy. However;  (1) some clearly improved pastures of marginal or moderately high altitude land presented difficulties. Were they '101' because they were improved or were they '102' because they retained notable amounts of Agrostis capillaris or bracken ?  (ii) the code '114', marsh, was used inconsistently. The handbook definition required the unit to be a_ nutrient-rich mire/wetland dominated by rushes or sedges. Some surveyors followed this definition and used the code only very sparingly. Others used the code to map parcels of land dominated by rushes in otherwise improved lowland agricultural grassland.  (iii) the partitioning of areas between '104', moorland-shrub heath and '111', blanket bog was in some cases rather arbitrary. Some surveyors, encouraged by the handbook, mapped extensive tracts of high rainfall wetland as '111', irrespective of the presence or absence of significant amounts of Friophorum spp.; others mapped a mosaic of blanket bog and moorland. Vegetation dominated by a combination of Calluna and Trichophorum seemed to have an equal chance of attracting either code.  Recommendation 8. That the present code '102', upland grassland be sub-divided  into:  Upland improved meadow/pasture; usually a mixture of Lolium perenne and Agrostis capillaris with Anthoxanthum odoratum, if present, sparse. Enclosed or unenclosed.  Upland grassland; less or unimproved grassland on mineral soil, lacking significant amounts of JLolium perenne. Typically with prominent Anthoxanthum odoratum; often supporting bracken.  Recommendation 9. There should be a code for lowland rush pasture.  Recommendation 10. That ‘wet heath' be recognised as a widespread and  57.  distinctive vegetation type and be awarded a primary code.  Even the awarding of primary boundary codes could result in mis-matches. The most consistent source of variation was the failure to distinguish between codes 321-323; hedges with >50% hawthorn, >50% dominance by another species and mixed species hedges respectively.  Recommendation 11. That the primary boundary code be restricted to 'hedge' and  its species composition covered by qualifying codes.  22 58.  Of other codes which produced a marked lack of concordance the most common mis-matches were those concerning forb cover and hedge condition. The codes for forb cover (138-140) were not defined in the handbook and were, in consequence, frequently misused. The restriction of code '357', ‘trimmed’, to hedges managed within the current year seems to have led to an over-use of code '358', ‘uncut’; many hedges nowadays are only managed in alternate years.  Mapping of species cover  59.  60.  In an attempt to measure the level of concordance between species mapped in a vegetation unit and those subsequently recorded around an assessment point the following values have been calculated for the degree of agreement between species codes at each of the nine points of the grid across all squares revisited.  Species 1 81% Species 2 34% Species 3 5%  Thus, if a given species is recorded at a cover of >25% at one time, there is an 81% likelihood that it will appear as a dominant or sub- dominant at the other time of survey. However, if two species are given as co-dominants the likelihood that both will be so recorded at both times drops to 34%. A level of concordance such that a vegetation unit having three co-dominants will be exactly matched at both survey times is only rarely achieved (5% concordance).  Considering the values given in paragraph 59 together with the values for concordance given in Table 16 below, two generalisations could be  made;  (i) even the unenclosed upland areas were very conscientiously mapped; the vegetation at the assessment point almost always bore some resemblance to that mapped but  (ii) only the more evident and widespread species gave a reasonable level of concordance and then only if comparisons are restricted to the most apparent species at a point.  Recoumendation 12. Only the two most prevalent species should be recorded  during the mapping of landuse parcels  23 = ZZ Gag Go  —  a  Table 16. Frequency of species records with over 25% cover.

Conclusions with respect to future surveys .  60.  Sensible photographs are a very important aid in the relocation of plots, especially in unenclosed land. In general the sketches and photographs for the 1990 survey were very reasonable but some points are worth noting for future surveys.  (1) Distance of plot to nearby features often not given. Many such features, whilst not sufficiently fixed to be used as prime locators, would have been very useful in practice.  (ii) Directions, and especially compass bearings, were often given from the plot to nearby features rather than vice versa. This made relocation especially difficult.  (1ii) Whilst in unenclosed situations, the photographs and sketches often enabled one to get very close to the actual location and were efficient in preventing the re-survey of adjacent but totally dissimilar habitat types, relocation would often have been greatly assisted iff distances and compass bearings had been included on the sketch for features identifiable in the photograph. Ideally time should be made available for the surveyors to annotate photos taken during the survey,  24 =e  . — Jt anata!  61.  62.  63.  64.  65.  The relocation rate for the metal plates was sufficiently high to consider their use a success. However, the relocation of plates in unenclosed uplands was very time-consuming; 30 minutes per plot was not unusual. If the system is to be retained for such areas extra man power would by required for relocation in future surveys.  Difficulties in location and orientation were particularly pronounced for the 'Y' plots. An improved technique for quadrat positioning on the ground has been recommended (Recommendation 5). Photographs of the location of the plot should clearly show the 2x2m area delineated on the ground. Nearby distinguishing features should be shown both on the photograph and on the accompanying sketch map (Recommendation 3). It is felt that such modifications would enhance the efficiency of recording of these small quadrats.  Although species identification was in general very adequate, errors associated with the recording of species, especially grasses having broadly similar vegetative characteristics and the failure’ to consistently record the allowable bryophytes, suggest that these groups should be targeted both during future training course and in the early stages of a QA exercise. Additional allowable bryophytes may be considered necessary where survey is restricted to individual habitats, especially in the context of the National Vegetation Classification, which relies heavily on bryophyte species in wetland/mire communities. Additional species which might need to be added to the list for other habitat-specific surveys might include;  Homalothecium lutescens and Ctenidium molluscum in calcareous grassland  Tortula ruraliformis and Brachythecium albicans on sand dunes  Fontinalis antipyretica and Rhynchostegium riparioides in running waters and Schistidium maritimum on coastal rocks.  The high level of species mis~-matches apparently due to variations in climatic conditions between year serves to emphasise the need for future QA to be made in the same year as the actual survey. Discrepancies due to summer versus autumn recording within a single year though less pronounced remain significant and should be avoided. QA should thus be restricted to the season and year of original survey (see also Recommendation 2).  With respect to landuse mapping and especially in view of the possibility of relating natural vegetation to the National Vegetation Classification the number of primary codes should be increased and the field surveyors provided with simple dichotomous keys to allow for unambiguous recording. Less emphasis during the mapping exercise should be given to the cover of individual species present. Only cover fur the most prevalent species should be recorded. This would almost certainly result in more reproducible mapping (Recommendation 12).  25 ee  —te-  References Bunce, R.G.H. and Shaw, M.W. (1973). A standardised procedure for ecological surtvey.

To understand exactly how the present Countryside Survey sampling framework has been derived, it is  important to review the concepts and activities that have evolved over the last 30 years since the first survey  was carried out.  It is possible that if the earlier time-series data were not so valuable as a basis for detecting  change, and a fresh start could be made today, then a different sampling strategy might be well be adopted.   However, the present Countryside Survey methodology is inextricably linked with its predecessors and an  understanding of these is essential.    Early development of the ITE Land Classification  The beginning  In the early 1970s, the idea of widespread ecological survey of areas as big as Great Britain was barely  conceivable.  However the concept of ecological sampling at a smaller scale (e.g. individual woodlands), was  commonly accepted and it was Bunce and Shaw13 who developed local regional survey into a national  ecological sampling system.  The important part of the approach was that the sampled areas should be  representative of the whole region and, to ensure this, they employed a stratification system.  The importance of a stratified system  In order to avoid bias in the selection of samples (thereby potentially invalidating the results), any sample  should be based on objective (e.g. random) selection procedures.  However, purely random sampling  programmes run the risk of selecting, by chance, a number of samples which are at one extreme in a range of  variability and therefore not ‘typical’ of the whole population being sampled.  An extreme example would be  where a national opinion poll, by chance, only included teenagers in the sample - their voting intentions may  not be representative of the voting population at large.    To minimise this risk, stratification systems are used to ‘carve up’ the population into discreet layers, or strata,  so that all parts of the population are sampled.  In the analogy above, most national opinion polls sample  within different age strata.  In ecological terms, it is likely that different species and ecological processes occur  in different types of land.  A simple stratification might then divide the land surface into different altitude ranges  so that uplands and lowlands, which tend to have different ecological characteristics, are adequately sampled.  However, this represents a very simple stratification and, just as opinion polls attempt to sample not just  different age strata but also those concerned with gender, social, racial and regional backgrounds, so other  factors are important in ecological survey.  Land at a certain altitude in north-east Scotland may have different 3 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007)  The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey   ecological affinities to land at the same altitude in East Anglia.  Thus other, secondary strata may need to be  introduced.  If this argument is extended to its logical conclusion, then it can be seen that many different strata  may need to be created by combining a number of different determining factors.  This is the theoretical basis  of the ITE Land Classification.    Development of the first version of the ITE Land Classification system.  In the early 1970s, Bunce and Shaw carried out a sample survey of the Lake District National Park.  They had  spent several years surveying and classifying vegetation in woodlands13 and elsewhere; this depended on  recording plant species in square plots (quadrats) and then classifying the quadrats into groups (vegetation  types) depending on which species were present.  Thus, all the quadrats in one group tended to have more or  less similar species present while those in another group had different species.  They used a multivariate  classification system called Indicator Species Analysis (ISA)35 to group the quadrats.  Bunce and Shaw  realised that the same approach could be ‘scaled up’ to classify areas of land, except that the quadrats would  be larger (eg a 1 km square) and, instead of using species as the basis of classifying, they would use  environmental attributes (such as altitude, geology and climate).  The work was pioneered in the Lake District  National Park and then extended and tested in Cumbria14, Lancashire and other regions of GB.  In 1975, the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology (ITE), capitalising on the potential of the approach, provided  funding for a national ecological survey of GB.  The survey had two major prerequisites:  •  it should be carried out using field survey (in order to obtain the level of ecological information required),   •  it should be carried out within a single field season.  As a result of the earlier work in Cumbria and elsewhere, it was thought that the sample unit of a 1km square  was appropriate, being small enough to survey in a reasonable period of time and yet large enough to contain  sufficient environmental features to allow differentiation of squares.  With over 240,000 1km squares in GB, a  sampling approach was an obvious necessity and a stratified, random sampling system was then developed –  the ITE Land Classification was born.  In the mid-1970s, when this work was being done, computing power was such that software packages like ISA  could only operate on a limited number of datasets.  Thus it was not possible to create a classification of all 1  km squares in GB and an alternative strategy had to be found.  By taking the centre square of a 15 x 15 km  grid across GB, a suitable number of squares was identified for classification (1228).  Environmental,  physiographic and other mapped data were then collected for each of the 1228 squares and the dataset was  analysed using ISA to produce 32 classes (Table 1).  Four squares surrounding each of the classified squares  were also allocated to classes using the key provided by ISA; thus a total of 6040 squares were classified  (Figure 1).  Full details of this procedure can be found in Bunce et al6 and Bunce et al7.  The 32 classes were  then described based on the average values of the environmental characteristics that were used to generate  the classes (for example, average altitude, slope and rainfall, and host of other environmental values).    The sampling framework for the first ecological survey of GB in 1978  Having generated the classification which would act as the sampling stratification system, the number of  samples to be surveyed was considered.  Ideally, this number would depend on the size of the stratum (ie how  many 1 km squares of the class occurred in GB) and on the ecological variability within the stratum.  Previous  work had suggested that for ecological surveys of this type, at least eight samples per stratum were  necessary.  Since this was the minimum requirement for each class, and resources were not available to  survey more squares, then eight were selected at random from each of the classes.  These squares were  taken from the grid of classified squares and thus the final sample for the first GB survey was a gridded,  stratified, random sample of 256 1 km squares.  The survey was actually carried out in the summers of 1977  (when a few pilot squares were sampled) and 1978 and focussed on vegetation quadrats and soils; habitat  areas were also mapped. 4 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007) The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey Table 1.

Map of ‘original’ (1978) ITE Land Classification 6 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007) The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey   The sampling framework for the second, land use survey of GB in 1984  In 1984, ITE funded a further GB survey although, by this time, the emphasis had shifted away from ecological  features such as soils and plant species in quadrats, to land use, landscape features and habitat mapping.   The same sampling framework was used as in 1978 but the sample size was increased by 50% so that 12  squares were surveyed in each of the 32 classes (including the eight squares previously visited).  With the  benefit of hindsight, there is an argument for having allocated the additional 128 new squares according to  land class size which would certainly have reduced the statistical error terms associated with national  estimates made from the sample.  However, this was not done.  Examples of change statistics between 1978  and 1984 were published in Barr et al.2    Application of the ITE Land Classification to Countryside Survey 1990   By 1990, and following the Ecological Consequences of Land Use Change (ECOLUC) programme carried out  by ITE on contract to the then Department of the Environment (DOE)3, both scientific and policy needs for a  further survey were identified.  Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990) was initiated with DOE, NERC, DTI and  NCC all contributing funding.  The first Land Cover Map of GB, derived from satellite imagery was also linked  to this programme.  Again, the ITE Land Classification was used as the sampling framework for a field survey but, in this third  survey, additional squares were allocated only to the larger land classes.  A total of 508 squares was surveyed  and all the features recorded in the 1984 survey, plus a repeat of the 1978 vegetation quadrats, was carried  out3.  The distribution of the squares within the Land Classes is shown in Table 2 and a map of sites is shown  as Figure 2.    Further development of the ITE Land Classification  CS1990 still used the original, gridded land classification that had been developed in the mid-1970s and  results were published based on the use of that system.  However, it became apparent that for estimations at  the regional and local level, the land classification had to be extended so that every square in GB was  classified.    Although computing power had increased considerably since the first classification, it was still an  insurmountable task to collect data for every square in GB at the same level of detail as had been done in the  original work.  Instead, the major climatic, geological and physiographic factors (or valid surrogates for these)  were obtained for each square and then a variety of multivariate classification procedures was tested on the  resulting dataset.  When the classes of the original sample of 1228 squares were compared with the new  classification attempts, the best simulation resulted in only a 62% correspondence.  However, all of the  squares that did not match exactly did fall into neighbouring land classes and the average characteristics of  the class remained unchanged, thus the classification was accepted as a reasonable replacement for its  earlier counterpart (Figure 3).    The net effect of this on the sampling framework was that as a result of some of the squares changing class,  the distribution across land classes was distorted and some classes were not well represented.  The effect of  this can be seen in column 3 of Table 2. 7 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007)  The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey   Figure 2.

Map of the ‘new’ (1990) ITE Land Classification. 9 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007)  The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey   Developments of the ITE Land Classification for Countryside Survey 2000  During the planning stages of Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000), there was consideration of sample  numbers in connection with several of the component modules.  This involved re-assessment of the existing  (CS1990) sample as well as the need for additional 1 km squares.  A number of issues have arisen from an  independent appraisal of CS1990 for policy purposes.  These include:  •  the effects of the changed ITE Land Classification.  •  the need to produce separate reliable estimates of surveyed features for Scotland and England with  Wales,  •  the need to provide statistically reliable estimates of upland habitats in England and Wales.  The new ITE Land Classification  As discussed above, the application of the new ITE Land Classification has resulted in some classes being  under-represented.  To correct this imbalance, a number of new squares were included as part of CS2000; the  details of how these are allocated are presented below, under ‘Separate country estimates’.  Separate country estimates  In CS1990, 508 1 km squares were sampled in England, Scotland, Wales and the Isle of Man.  The sample of  squares was drawn at random from a grid of squares in the 32 ITE Land Classes.  As described above, these  classes were created using underlying environmental attributes and therefore crossed country (E, S & W)  boundaries.  Country estimates were derived from the mean characteristics of all squares in each class,  irrespective of their country location.  A CS2000 Scoping Study34 recommended that the sampling framework should be modified to enable reporting  on ‘country units’, being (a) England with Wales and (b) Scotland, separately using only squares which lie in  the country for which estimates are to be made.  Additional samples have been deployed to assist with this requirement and the following changes have been  made to the sampling framework:  • class sub-division - the ITE Land Classes have been sub-divided into the ‘country unit’ versions of the  original classes,  • class aggregation - where this has resulted in there being very few squares of any particular class  remaining in a country, then this ‘rump’ has been aggregated with a similar class in that country (the net effect  of the class sub-divisions and aggregations is to create 40 strata, instead of the earlier 32),  • additional squares - to ensure that there is adequate representation of all new classes in each country unit,  19 additional squares have been allocated and this gives a minimum of 6 squares in each new class.  To  ensure relatively consistent sampling rates between England and Wales, a further 11 squares (5 in England  and 6 in Wales) have been allocated,  • Land Class 17 - Wales is dominated by Land Class 17 and to help refine the results reported for Wales, a  sub-division of Land Class 17 has been carried out in Wales.  In the allocation of any new squares in Wales  (either detailed above or in any further options), representation of the new sub-classes has been respected.  • Isle of Man – the two sample squares in the IOM included in previous surveys do not contribute to  estimates for ‘country units’ and are replaced by two new squares in England.  The revised land class maps for England with Wales and for Scotland are shown as Figure 4. 10 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007) The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey Figure 4.  Map of revised ITE Land Classes in ‘England with Wales’ and in Scotland – the  sampling framework for CS2000 11 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007)  The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey   Survey of uplands in England and Wales  An additional module within CS2000, funded by DETR, MAFF, and WO/CCW, included surveying an  additional 30 squares which have been placed in ITE Land Classes which occur in the uplands and marginal  uplands of England and Wales.  This gives better statistical accuracy to the estimates of habitats in the uplands of England and Wales which,  due to the need to provide separate, country-based estimates, would otherwise be under-sampled.

Since devolution, there has been an increasing need for the National Assembly of Wales  and environmental organisations to have access to habitat status and change information on a Wales-only  basis in order to meet the requirements of country-specific environmental policy and legislation.      Welsh-only Estimates    The adjustments in CS2000 included the addition of some Welsh squares, bringing their number up to 64, and  making Wales the most intensively sampled of the three individual countries (England 0.22%, Scotland 0.24%  and Wales 0.29% of total land area). However, in regard to the precision of national estimates, which depends  on absolute numbers rather than proportions, the number of field survey squares in Wales is low compared to  the number in Scotland (203) and England (302).   A scoping report in 200642 concludes that the existing  number of 64 squares in Wales was not adequate for Wales-only reporting for the 2007 survey.  As a consequence, the following changes were made to the 2000 sampling framework for 2007:  •  Class sub-divisions – the ITE Land Classes have been sub-divided into the ‘country unit’ (England and  Wales) versions of the original land classes creating five new classes: 5w, 6w, 7w,15w,18w  •  Number of classes - the effect of the class sub-divisions is to create 45 strata instead of the earlier 40  •  Additional squares – to ensure that there is adequate representation of new classes in Wales, a total of  43 additional squares were surveyed in Wales, this gives a minimum of 6 squares in each Welsh class.  •  Additional squares in England to compensate for the removal of Welsh squares were not warranted.   Two of the English Classes (5e, 15e) are left with only 4 squares per class, however, the 2006 scoping  study42 states the reduction in precision of English estimates is relatively small and the small number of  squares in these classes should still be adequate for reporting purposes.    The revised class map for England, Wales and Scotland is shown in figure 6. 15 The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (2007)  The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey   Figure 6.

Estimates for GB for example can be  calculated either using the latest classification (effectively three separate classifications for the three countries)  or the original (1990) classification.  For consistency with in an individual survey the former approach is  preferred whilst the latter is more consistent across surveys’.

Quality Assurance Exercise  1992 Mike Prosser and Hilary Wallace  Ecological Surveys (Bangor)  Date Received: / /03 Li b ra ry LIBRARY  Centre for Ecology and Hydrology University of Wales, Bangor Deiniol Road, Bangor  Gwynedd LL57 2UP  Tel: 01248 370245 Fax: 01248 355365  Report to ITE, Merlewood ere  Lae  —  c  Weer nse  1990 COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY: QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE  Mike Prosser and Hilary Wallace (Ecological Surveys (Bangor)).  Introduction 1. This paper outlines the scope of the quality assurance carried out in  connection with the 1990 Countryside Survey, presents the results and includes a series of recommendations in accordance with the aims of the  exercise, Background 2. It 1s recognised that in a field investigation on the scale of the  Countryside Survey the large numbers of recorders and surveyors involved must produce an inherent’ degree of variation despite the provision of a training course, a field: handbook and on-site visits by supervisors (Quality Control). Whilst thére is no reason to expect any directional bias in the records made, nor was any subsequently demonstrated, it is important to attempt a measure of the consistency and reliability of the work done within the major components of the field programme (Quality Assurance).  3. In August 1989, during the preparatory phase of the survey, an exercise was conducted whereby a group of field workers were invited both to independently assess the vegetation of a pair of fixed quadrats and to Similarly record plots which they were required to find on the basis of crosses marked on a standard map at 1:7500 scale. The results are presented in Hallam and Bunce (1991). The experience gained during this exercise was used during the subsequent training course. Pairs of surveyors were tested on their ability to record both fixed and relocated plots of the types to be used in the main survey. Results for this and for a similar exercise carried out as a trial QA exercise based on the 1988 partial Countryside survey (Wallace and Prosser 1990) are compared with the findings from the most recent field programme and presented and discussed later, (See Table 6 and Para. 26).  4. The difficulties associated with the use of cover estimates derived from a range of recorders has been highlighted by Sykes et. al. (1983) but the broader aspects of plot relocation by teams, bias in species recognition and the effects of such variation on the validity of ecological generalisations has been largely ignored in previous surveys.  Aims  5. (a) To quantify the accuracy of field recording in the Countryside Survey 1990 and to comment on the accuracy of change statistics.  (b) To explain any differences in recording in terms of observer error, time of year, plot location, type of information, geographical region and special factors such as drought. (c) To relate the conclusions from (a) and (b) to previous comparative work done on ITE survey methods.  (d) To recommend modifications to survey methodology for future surveys which will improve the accuracy and confidence of the resulting  statistics. Methods 6. Two separate series of assessments have been carried out. The first,  conducted during October-November 1990, and restricted, by the time available, to 21 of the original survey squares, relied only on the sketch maps of the original surveyors for plot relocation. The work was divided between two independent pairs of assessors. The second phase, during June-September 1991, tested the potential improvement to be gained through the use, in addition, of photographs of individual plots.  7. In 1991 the assessors were provided with a single 1km square from each of the original 32 terrain classes. As an additional exercise in self assessment a group of squares originally surveyed by one or both of the assessors was included in the trial. The 1991 itinerary was so arranged that each 1km square was visited within 14 days of the corresponding Original survey date; 28 of the 32 squares were visited by a single pair of assessors. Details of the 1991 QA itinerary form Annex A.  8. One quarter of each square was resurveyed so as to include one of each of the plot types represented in the whole square. The six plot types used in the 1990 Countryside Survey can be sub-divided into;  Quadrats: 200m2 (X-plots, after Bunce and Shaw 1973) m2 (Y-plots)  Linear plots, all 10x1m which include;  Roadverges, commencing adjacent to and parallel with the carriageway. A second parallel strip was originally surveyed in the case of wide verges (not included in the QA exercise). Hedges, running parallel with the hedge line and commencing at the mid-point of the hedge.  Streamsides, from normal water level or at the lower limit of vegetation cover in the case of water courses with extensive gravel or pebble beds etc.  Boundaries, in enclosed land only; recorded at the boundary marker (plate) associated with the 200m” X-plot.  An attempt was made in each case to relocate the buried metal plate marking one corner of each quadrat using the original sketch map, the surveyors photograph and a metal detector. The plot was recorded using the standard Countryside Survey 1990 procedure in accordance with the Field Handbook. In addition, the landcover and boundary features were recorded at 9 pre-determined points on a grid within the selected quarter of the square. A synopsis of the methods forms Annex B. a  =m mee nwichees  Plate relocation  9.  Table  The plot may often be accurately relocated on the basis of the sketch map measurements and a good photograph. However, it was considered important to investigate the effectiveness with which the plates themselves could be physically relocated (Table 1).  1.

Three categories of performance were recognised with respect to the relocation of original plots within a square:  (i) Plate, and hence plot, relocated  (ii) Plate not found, or no plate used, but assessor satisfied that location of resurvey adequately matched original location.  (iii) Plate not found; information insufficient to allow satisfactory relocation of plot.  Species concordance  11.  A variety of measures may be used to compare aggregate records made for the same plot at different times. Four indices are used in this report and are defined as follows:  (i) Percentage (%) agreement: common species divided by the aggregate of species at time 1 (T1) plus time 2 (T2). The simplest, crudest, but most objective value.  (ii) T1 agreement: common species divided by the total recorded at T2. This index removes species believed to have been erroneously  recorded during the original survey.  (iii) T2 agreement: common species divided by the total recorded at T1, The corollary of T1 agreement whereby the initial recording is regarded as the more correct. 14.  (iv) % accuracy: Common species divided by total species minus T2 errors. This is intended to remove variations due to e.g. season, management change, plot mis-orientation etc. (See para. 20).  The overall concordance given by indices i, ii and iii for individual squares forms Annex C. Percentage accuracy by square is given in Table  5, following Para. 25.  An initial exercise carried out by I. Taylor at Merlewood on a selection of the first assessment results indicated that;  (i) the mean number of species recorded at T1 (22.77) and T2 (22.72) was virtually identical,  (ii) the overall % agreement = 452,  (iii) the variation could be partitioned as follows;  A+D~ Mis-identification 10% B+tI Species overlooked on one occasion 33% C+G Error in plot location a 37% E Changes in management of plot 3% F Temporal differences 5% H+ J Mis-alignment of plot 122%  The prefix letters will be referred to below.  The exercise referred to above was limited to an analysis of the results from 12 squares and compares the species complement of a plot in summer with that in late autumn where fewer species might be present and identifiable.  A subsequent analysis of the full data set (21 squares) gives an overall percentage agreement of 47.1.  The results have also been recalculated after subtracting those records for common species present in the original survey which would not have been available for recording during the October QA. Examples: Ranunculus ficaria, Conopodium majus, Hyacinthoides non-scripta, Arum maculatum, Bromus sterilis etc.  Out of a total of 2148 species records made in the original survey it is considered that 88 would not have been recorded during the QA due to this seasonal difference (c.3.5%). If these records are deleted from the comparison, the differences in mean number of species per plot recorded becomes;  Original survey 20.2 Autumn QA 20.9  This suggests that the assessors were recording 3.5% more species per plot than were the original surveyors.  The results of the 1991 assessment are presented in Table 2 below.  Although the increases in mean species number evident from the results for each plot type were not statistically significant, when the sample size is increased by the pooling of all plots a highly significant increase in species number between the original survey and the 1991 re~ assessment is demonstrated. ===  ! ] ] ! | | i  j i i  i  ! |  Table 2 Comparison of species numbers per plot 1990 v 1991.

Wilcoxon Matched Pairs; full data set; z2=3.86, p <0.001  Since, in the extended 1991 QA exercise, the same assessors were surveying the plots recorded by the same set of surveyors there is no reason to suppose that the relative efficiency of recording would have changed. Therefore, the indication is that the 13% increase in species per plot found during the 1991 QA (see Table 2) is largely due to real differences in the species complement of the plots. Using the value for efficiency of recording derived above (para. 14) from the 1990 QA exercise, it would seem that c.27% of the species increase can be attributed to a greater efficiency of recording by the assessors and the residual 73% to this real increase in species per plot in the 1991 growing season compared with the same plots in 1990.  Some progress on the nature of the change in species number has been made through a simple comparison of the self-assessment plots. These plots, all in the southern half of Britain and surveyed in summer 1990 and summer 1991, give the following results:  N Species number 1990% C.Vv 1990 1991 1990 1991 42 22.8 24.7 92.4 41.6 39.1 0.37  This again suggests that annual variation is contributing more to the change in species number than is any effect of recorder experience; the figures indicate that under-recording during the initial survey may account for 30% of the difference (or c.3% of the total species record) whilst 70% may be attributable to a difference between the drought year of 1990 and the comparatively normal growing season of 1991.  Thus evidence from both QA exercises point to a similar real increase in species numbers between the two years and show that much of the variation within category B (species overlooked) of the original survey was spurious.  However, the situation is less straight forward than is demonstrated by this simple approach. If there is a marked difference due to the effect of the 1990 drought, then the values for species per plot for the two years should be very similar in those wet, upland, unenclosed plots not subject to drought. This is not so. When a comparison is made of species per plot in the unenclosed lands of the uplands, the values obtained emetic ee  es  eer  eure ree  are; 1990 1991 Total species record 825 952  Mean species per plot 27.5 31.7  As the values show these are species-rich plots. It seems that in such diverse vegetation there is liable to be a diminution in the efficiency of recording by the average surveyor. The species record is required to include common and characteristic bryophytes and lichens. It is in Lhese moist, semi-natural habitats that this element becomes pronounced; bryophytes were in general less well recorded than were vascular plants. It is relevant to note here that during the autumn QA a different pair of assessors visited a sample of the species-rich plots of this group in late October with the following outcome:  Original October 1990  survey Total species record 586 616 Mean species per plot 32.6 34.2  Even at this late stage of the season cxpericnced assessors were recording more species per plot than the summer values for the original survey. These findings emphasise the difficulty of making generalisations on the accuracy of change statistics across different plot types and in different land classes and demonstrate the need to restrict comparisons of change in species number to areas of similar landuse e.g. arable land, permanent pastures, marginal area, uplands, etc. They also emphasise the need for caution when comparing records made by surveyors with varying levels of field experience.  Recommendation 1. The list of bryophytes and lichens to be recorded should be  20.  21.  retained for general survey, perhaps with minor modifications. During future training courses samples of each species, together with habitat information, should be available for study and familiarisation.  Notwithstanding the results of the 1990 re-assessment, an attempt has heen made to apportion sources of error between the original survey and the 1991 QA. This includes a distinction between the lack of agreement due to inadequate recording at the time of initial survey (T1 variations) and changes not so attributable (12 variations).  Within each category, sub-divisions have been erected so as to more satisfactorily apportion individual discrepancies within T1 and T2.  The categories used are as follows:  T1 variations  A) Apparent mis-identifications or mis-codings The former are usually apparent. However, there have certainly been instances where the wrong box has been ticked, e.g. in the adjacent pair Angelica sylvestris and Anthriscus sylvestris, Primula vulgaris and Prunella vulgaris. [esesnen: I mere ne  B) Species considered to have been overlooked at T1.  As the season progressed the assessors became increasingly convinced that many species showed an altered profile between the two seasons especially in the more drought-affected lowland squares. Since in many instances individual changes could not be proven, the lack of such species at T1 has been classified as a T1 error. In consequence the apparent error in this category has undoubtedly been over-estimated. Among the more apparent examples of year on year population changes encountered are the annuals Galium aparine, Geranium robertianum and Lapsana communis, the biennial Alliaria petiolata and more surprisingly the perennials of the Taraxacum aggregate.  mw GE Go  C) Overzealous recording During the QA particular care was taken to restrict recording to the exact plot size stipulated. It appears that in some cases the initial surveyors had either not adequately measured the plot or had included species adjacent to but not strictly within the defined area.  pean  J) Inadmissible records due to a combination of the positioning otf the original plot in a way which did not correspond with the standard protocol and failure to note this on the sketch.  D) Mysteries. Species records, apparently incorrect, for which no reasonable explanation could be found.  T2 variations  E) Species change due to change in management Change in crop between years, use of herbicide sprays, vehicle erosion etc.  F) Species change due to seasonal effects. Partially overlaps with E, i.e. different suites of annual herbs in differing crops; many other changes apparent amongst ephemerals on drier banks and annual herbs such as those in hedgerows.  G) Mis-match of records through failure to exactly relocate plot at T2.  H) Locational mis~matches where plot location was  refound but orientation or alignment probably differed markedly from the original.  I) Species present but overlooked at T2.  The protocol adopted at T2 was as follows: the plot was relocated from the map, sketch map and photograph, and recorded 'blind'. After completion of the record the original data sheet was examined and a fresh search made to deal with apparent discrepancies. Species subsequently found but not initially recorded were classed | as 'I' errors.  22. It is very probable that many records ascribed to T1 errors are in | reality the results of seasonal and/or management changes which could not be directly demonstrated (see Paras. 3 and 17). In Tables 3 and 4 below Variation B will result in an initial under-recording of species whilst Variation C (directly) and I (indirectly) will inflate the figures for species records. Since it is clear that 'B' errors are greater than the sum of 'C' plus 'I', the overall effect is to produce an under-estimate during the initial survey.  Recommendation 2. Future QA exercises should be carried out as close as is  a  practical to the initial time of survey.  mismatches 4 T ws * Ti%*xx T1 Variations Type A Mis ID 3.04 0.57 B Overlooked 14.58 9.94 C Over zealous 2.76 1.30 D Mysteries 1.28 0.48 J Incorrect positioning 1.89 nil 2 Variations E Management 0.98 2.53 F Season 7.11 11.57 G Plot mis-location 1.86 1.79 H Plot mis-orientation 5.22 4.65 I Overlooked 1.43 3.59 I * assessments of 28 squares originally surveyed by other surveyors  II ** assessments of 7 squares originally surveyed by one or both of the assessors themselves.  23.

Table  26.  The percentage agreement is thus 60.9; this compares very favourably with the 45% suggested by the partial analysis of the autumn 1990 QA, (See para. 12). It also accords well with the findings of Kirby et. al. (1986) who give a range of 47-62 for percentage agreement between Species lists for woodland 'X' plots relocated from sketch maps by different observers at different seasons of the same year.  T2 variations can be removed from the calculation to give an initial efficiency of recording (% accuracy); this original accuracy of recording of the 1990 survey averages 74% (See Table 5). This approaches the value of 79% given as the maximum attainable efficiency between standardised searches by experienced field workers in Nilsson and Nilsson (1985).  5.

The comparisons include a mixture of 'X' plots and linear plots and represent both ‘lowland' and ‘upland' situations. In this and in subsequent analyses plot data were partitioned into four Land Class aggregates following the practice adopted during the ECOLOC project whereby:  LC: land classes dominated by the arable-growing areas of the lowlands  LG: land classes dominated by lowland grasslands  MA: land classes in marginal areas  UP: land classes in the uplands  LC plus LG and MA plus UP were also considered as representative of ‘lowland’ and 'upland' situations respectively.

Trial 6, in which both seasonal and locational errors are eliminated, indicates the level of recording immediately prior to the start of the survey. It may be compared with the 74% accuracy measured for the full QA exercise (see Para. 25). The improvement may reflect a combination of the surveyors increasing familiarity with the methods and_ the opportunity to make subsequent identifications of material collected from plots during actual fieldwork; an opportunity not available during the observer bias experiment itself. Comparisons of the other results show the dramatic improvement associated with the use of photographs to re-establish the exact position of plots and, to a lesser but still marked extent, the effect of seasonal and annual changes in depressing the level of agreement between records [or individual plots.  Further analysis of the sources of error within individual plot types and a comparison of enclosed versus unenclosed situations is useful for the planning of further training courses, surveys, etc.  A breakdown of the main sources of error by plot type, with a further  sub-division into lowland (LC + LG) and upland (MA + UP) landclasses is given below [Table 7].  10 Table 7.

An analysis of variance of the 1991 QA exercise by plot type and landclass shows no significant difference in the % accuracy achieved in the individual survey between plot types but a highly significant difference between landclass aggregates:  F P Plot 1.003 0.418 NS Landclass aggregate 10.56 0.001 weK Interaction 0.87 0.565 NS Notes: percentage accuracy is arrived at by eliminating T2  variations which are due largely to errors in plot location (see Para. 11). X plots which have undergone a change of crop have been excluded from the analysis.  The effect demonstrated is due to a significantly lower degree of accuracy in the recording of those plots falling in the lowland arable landclasses (LC); the other classes have all been recorded at approximately the same level of efficiency. The reasons for the comparatively poor performance in the most lowland squares are unclear but may include a lower overall level of experience amongst the surveyors involved, a generally greater level of species diversity in lowland squares and a greater short-term species flux especially in arable areas.  The recording of vegetation cover  33.  34.  As an integral part of the original recording schedule, surveyors were required to give visual estimates for cover for any species perceived to exceed 5% cover in a plot. These estimates were repeated during the QA. The comparison of cover values presented in Table 8 matches estimates made in all plots where the species was recorded as present at both  times of survey. ,  Although the table below shows only two species, Holcus lJanatus and Poa trivialis, to have been recorded at significantly different covers in the original survey and the assessment, several other significant differences are apparent when Lhe dala are sub divided into lowland, marginal and upland groups of squares.  Cover estimates by landclass aggregate, for a selection of relevant species, are presented as Annex D.  12 Plots having the species recorded at both T1 and T2.

Although there are almost 40% of species mis-matches when direct comparisons are made between individual pairs of plots it might be expected that these differences would, for many of the commoner individual species, average out over a large number of plots. To test this assumption the frequencies of all species recorded have been compared for the 1990 survey and the subsequent full re-assessment.  36. A comparison of the frequencies of the most prevalent species across al] terrain classes is presented in Table 9.  Table 9.

It is not possible to apportion the reasons for individual discrepancies with any confidence but the following points may be made.  (i) The apparent increases in Taraxacum spp., Gallium aparine and Cirsium arvense along with similar increases in frequency for the less prevalent species Lapsana communis and Alliaria petiolata do appear to reflect a genuine change in the populations of these species between the two years of survey.  (ii) In contrast, the apparent changes in Lolium perenne and Poa trivialis seem to result from under-recording during the initial survey; Poa trivialis across all plot types and Lolium in more marginal and upland situations.  (iii) Of the less prevalent species only Holcus mollis appears to have been consistently over-recorded in the original survey. Kirby also refers to an inconsistency ot distinction between Holcus mollis and H.lanatus in his observer bias trials.  Recommendation 6. One aspect of future training courses should involve a  concentration on the field characteristics which serve to distinguish the members of similar taxa with emphasis on vegetative identification of common grasses.  Overall effects of species change  Marked changes in apparent species composition have been demonstrated for individual plots of all types. In order to assess the effects of this variation on the plots as a whole the quadrats have been arranged on a continuum using the first axis of a DECORANA analysis (Hill 1979) as the gradient. All pairs of quadrats of a single plot type from the original survey and from the 1991 re-assessment have been pooled. For each pair the change in axis score has been plotted against the percentage agreement in species complement at the two times of survey. The assumption to be tested is that, though the axis scores for individual pairs may shift markedly due to e.g. a change in management between years or a failure to accurately relocate a particular plot, the results for the two total records should form a single population with little or no overall shift in mean axis score.  The resulting graphs for individual plot types form Figure 1.  Three plot types are represented in the Figure; those omitted, hedge, boundary and roadverge plots show a very similar distribution of points. A 50 unit change in First AXIS score has been taken as a purely arbitrary level above which reasons are sought for the discrepancy between Time 1 and Time 2 records. No single cause for large discrepancies is evident; four causes of variation contribute to the scatter of points; crop change, problems of plot relocation, failures in Species recording during the original survey and disparity in the awarding of cover values for species recorded. (Variations due to the latter are notable in woodland plots. The field handbook states ‘cover of tree species should be put in parentheses’; surveyors were not consistent in their attitude to cover resulting from species not  obviously rooted in the plot. )  14 40  41.  Table  42.  Recommendation 7. Recording of tree and shrub cover should be dealt with more  explicitly in handbooks and training courses. Rules should also be adopted for the use of such data in subsequent analyses.  Percentage agreement has been selected as the X-axis since it demonstrates the full extent of variation between pairs of quadrats. Thus, the cluster of open circles to the LHS of the 'X' plot graph results largely from changes between cereal and other arable crops over the two years. Different crops are accompanied by different suites of arable weeds and in consequence there may be a high level of mis~match which only infrequently results in an appreciable shift along the axis.  With the exception of the hedge data, the Eigenvalue for the first axis was uniformly high and the gradient between the acid soils of the uplands and the possibly more nutrient-rich lowlands was strong.  Hedges are nol prevalent in the uplands and, perhaps in consequence of the inevitable 'clumping' of the data, even the first axis Eigenvalue was low (0.54) and correlation between axes was marked. The first axis appeared to reflect a gradient between shade intolerant and _ shade tolerant species.  When the shift in median position of axis 1 is calculated it is seen to range for the different plot types as shown in Table 10.  10. Plot type Median shift in Direction of axis score change  "x! 0.3 units towards 'lowland' Verges 4.1 units towards 'lowland' Streams 4.3 units towards 'lowland' ‘y' 4.4 units towards 'lowland' Boundaries 5.1 units towards ‘lowland’ Hedges 5.3 units towards 'shade'  The preliminary results for changes in mean axis score as distinct from changes in median position, together with a comparison the coefficients of variance, are presented in Table 11.  Although the shift in the ecological gradient is always in the same direction the polarity of the axis is arbitrary. Hence, the uplands may attract either the highest or lowest scores in an individual analysis. Since the range of first axis scores varies markedly between analyses for individual plot types no direct comparison may be made between then.  15 ee  Table 11.

An analysis of variance, using pooled data from all plot types, by year,  44,  45.  landclass aggregate and level of interaction between these two variables with respect to mean first axis score demonstrates no significant difference either between 1990 and 1991 or any interaction between year and landclass aggregate. However, the mean axis score for the aggregate UP differs significantly from those of all other landclass aggregates. This reflects the very distinctive and stable vegetation of the moors, heaths and bogs which have been little influence by changes in recent agricultural practices.  The results are summarised below:  Mean Axis score ANOVA Landclass 1990 1991 QA Variable p aggregate Year 0.923 LC 492 492 Landclass 0.001 LG 466 466 Year*Landclass 1.000 MA 455 460 UP 292 299  The overall axis shift between 1990 and 1991, though insufficient to be significant at this relatively small sample size, parallells that previously demonstrated during the ECOLUC project. To what extent the 1990-1991 results reinforce the changes previously demonstrated or are evidence of a singular climatic shift between the two individual seasons cannot at present be established with certainty.  That both factors are operating is suggested by the results of a further DECORANA analysis. A comparison has been made of the 50 plots, comprising 'X'’ plots, roadverges, hedges and streamsides, for which data were available for three time periods; the 1978 survey, the 1990 survey and the 1991 QA exercise. When the quadrat data are pooled in a single analysis and the first axis scores are compared for each plot at each time the following axis shifts (Table 12) are produced.  16 Table 12.

In contrast, the temporary reversal ot the trend in the less intensively farmed areas may illustrate the effect of annual variation (possibly an enhanced effect of drought on the more  | susceptible vegetation of marginal areas) which is likely to cause year to year perturbations within the general trend.  Performance of species groups  46. In addition to the performance of individual species and to changes in the total complement of a given plot, changes in the cumulative frequency of species groups is of interest in the context of landuse change. In a preliminary exercise a group of 10 species has been selected from each plot type (15 in the case of 'Y' plots), their frequencies summed for each of the two years under examination and a simple 't' test performed to establish whether the overall frequency of the members of a group has differed significantly. The species chosen in each case are selected as being representative of the central portion of the relevant species ordination. Any change in frequency in these ‘conservative’ species would provide strong evidence for a significant landuse change.  47. The results are presented below.

The mapping of agricultural landuse and the distribution of natural vegetation  48,  49.  This involves the use of a series of codes which may, for the purpose of analysis, be sub-divided into three groups;  (i) Primary codes: major habitat and crop types,  (ii) Secondary descriptive codes: relate to stock and variations in land management,  (iii) Cover codes: a further characterisation of a given parcel of land using a combination of the mapping of the most prevalent species together with a code denoting the cover of each.  The efficiency of mapping can be tested in two ways. The frequency of primary codes can provide a population estimate which will indicate any overall discrepancy in the units mapped. The accuracy of mapping at a  18 particular point can be gauged by matching the primary code awarded by the assessors at a point location with the code given in the original survey for the parcel of land in which the point is located.  50- A comparison of the frequency of use of primary landuse codes is  presented in Table 13.  Table 13. The Number of times individual primary codes are assigned  Lowland square Upland square Total  Primary code 1990 1991 1990 1991 1990 1991  101 77 76 30 30 107 106  Arable codes 43 42 0 ) 43 42  111 0 0 26 24 26 24  104 0 0 23 21 23 21  102 1 0 14 10 15 10  105 4 4 0 0 4 4  114 0 3 1 4 1 7  109 1 1 0 0 1 1  103 0 0 2 6 2 6  112 0 0 2 3 2 3  115 0 0 5 5 5 5  Total 126 126 103 103 229 229  51. It is clear that the allocation of primary codes to the principal types of landuse and of natural vegetation cover is very reliable. The minor categories occur with such limited frequency that the sampling is insufficient to adequately test the effectiveness of the original recording.  52. When point by point comparisons are made over the grid of sample points  for each square assessed the general results show a very high level of agreement for the lowland areas and a greater variability in the interpretation of upland vegetation (See Table 14). Some of the latter may be due to problems of location in unenclosed land.  Table 14. Pair-wise comparisons of primary codes  Lowland Upland Overall Primary codes 120 73 193 concurring Primary codes 6 30 36 not-concurring Percentage agreement 95.22 70.9% 84.3% 53. An extended comparison sf the use of codes, both for landuse and for  boundary features, has been made using the data from all squares where a three-way comparison is possible i.e. those squares which were either | re-surveyed both in autumn 1990 and in summer 1991 by the same pair of  | 19 =a = oo  54.  assessors, or were re-visited on the two occasions by different pairs of assessors. The results are summarised in Table 15.  Points arising: (i) The overall concordance between landuse primary codes (88.7%) is Similar to that shown for the initial exercise presented in Table 14  (84.3%).  (ii) The equivalent concordance for the primary codes used to describe boundary features is slightly lower (80.3%) and yet is noticeably inflated by the high level of agreement resulting from the same assessors re~visiting the same squares in both autumn 1990 and summer 1991. (The 1990 data were not referred to in the subsequent survey so both the location of the point on the grid and its assessment were independent on the two occasions).  (iii) The reasonably good agreement in the use of Level 1 qualifiers, 79% for landuse and 83% in the case of boundaries, together with the concordance for primary codes reflects the product of two opposing trends in the survey: the conscientiousness of the surveyors (there was virtually no evidence of guess work) and the level of interpretation residing in the codes provided despite the great efforts made to furnish unique definitions for each code.  (iv) The remarkable similarity in overall performance shown in Comparison 2 emphasises this element of interpretation: there was no real difference in the use of codes between pairs of assessors and between assessors and surveyors. Unlike the situation in species recording within quadrats, the assessors proved themselves to be very average surveyors with respect to the use of mapping codes.  Level 1 versus Level 2 agreement.  The large number of available codes, especially in connection with boundary features, make adequate comparisons of T1 and T2 mapping difficult. ‘the approach adopted is best illustrated with a simple example.  A typical pair of code combinations for a survey point might be:  Original survey QA Code 321 Hedge, 50% hawthorn 321 342 <2m high 342 351 Stockproof Not stockproof 352 353 Filled gaps <10% - - Trimmed 357 Laying 361 This would translate in Table 15 as; Primary code agreement J Qualifying codes Agreement at Level 1 J Xx (50%) Agreement at Level 2 (20%) since, of a  total of six qualifying codes used, one was common to both records, one pair represented a mismatch, one was noted at T1 but not T2 and two appeared at T2 but were absent at the T1 record.  20 Table 15.

Despite the thoroughness with which the Field Handbook of the 1990 Countryside Survey was compiled it is clear that confusion remained in the allocating of some codes. Two sources of variation were apparent; (i) inversions of particular pairs of codes and  (ii) difficulties of interpretation of some qualifying codes.  With respect to the first source of variation, the commonest primary landuse codes, the collection of arable codes and 101 = lowland agricultural grassland were clear, unambiguous and were, in consequence, mapped with a very high level of accuracy. However;  (1) some clearly improved pastures of marginal or moderately high altitude land presented difficulties. Were they '101' because they were improved or were they '102' because they retained notable amounts of Agrostis capillaris or bracken ?  (ii) the code '114', marsh, was used inconsistently. The handbook definition required the unit to be a_ nutrient-rich mire/wetland dominated by rushes or sedges. Some surveyors followed this definition and used the code only very sparingly. Others used the code to map parcels of land dominated by rushes in otherwise improved lowland agricultural grassland.  (iii) the partitioning of areas between '104', moorland-shrub heath and '111', blanket bog was in some cases rather arbitrary. Some surveyors, encouraged by the handbook, mapped extensive tracts of high rainfall wetland as '111', irrespective of the presence or absence of significant amounts of Friophorum spp.; others mapped a mosaic of blanket bog and moorland. Vegetation dominated by a combination of Calluna and Trichophorum seemed to have an equal chance of attracting either code.  Recommendation 8. That the present code '102', upland grassland be sub-divided  into:  Upland improved meadow/pasture; usually a mixture of Lolium perenne and Agrostis capillaris with Anthoxanthum odoratum, if present, sparse. Enclosed or unenclosed.  Upland grassland; less or unimproved grassland on mineral soil, lacking significant amounts of JLolium perenne. Typically with prominent Anthoxanthum odoratum; often supporting bracken.  Recommendation 9. There should be a code for lowland rush pasture.  Recommendation 10. That ‘wet heath' be recognised as a widespread and  57.  distinctive vegetation type and be awarded a primary code.  Even the awarding of primary boundary codes could result in mis-matches. The most consistent source of variation was the failure to distinguish between codes 321-323; hedges with >50% hawthorn, >50% dominance by another species and mixed species hedges respectively.  Recommendation 11. That the primary boundary code be restricted to 'hedge' and  its species composition covered by qualifying codes.  22 58.  Of other codes which produced a marked lack of concordance the most common mis-matches were those concerning forb cover and hedge condition. The codes for forb cover (138-140) were not defined in the handbook and were, in consequence, frequently misused. The restriction of code '357', ‘trimmed’, to hedges managed within the current year seems to have led to an over-use of code '358', ‘uncut’; many hedges nowadays are only managed in alternate years.  Mapping of species cover  59.  60.  In an attempt to measure the level of concordance between species mapped in a vegetation unit and those subsequently recorded around an assessment point the following values have been calculated for the degree of agreement between species codes at each of the nine points of the grid across all squares revisited.  Species 1 81% Species 2 34% Species 3 5%  Thus, if a given species is recorded at a cover of >25% at one time, there is an 81% likelihood that it will appear as a dominant or sub- dominant at the other time of survey. However, if two species are given as co-dominants the likelihood that both will be so recorded at both times drops to 34%. A level of concordance such that a vegetation unit having three co-dominants will be exactly matched at both survey times is only rarely achieved (5% concordance).  Considering the values given in paragraph 59 together with the values for concordance given in Table 16 below, two generalisations could be  made;  (i) even the unenclosed upland areas were very conscientiously mapped; the vegetation at the assessment point almost always bore some resemblance to that mapped but  (ii) only the more evident and widespread species gave a reasonable level of concordance and then only if comparisons are restricted to the most apparent species at a point.  Recoumendation 12. Only the two most prevalent species should be recorded  during the mapping of landuse parcels  23 = ZZ Gag Go  —  a  Table 16. Frequency of species records with over 25% cover.

Conclusions with respect to future surveys .  60.  Sensible photographs are a very important aid in the relocation of plots, especially in unenclosed land. In general the sketches and photographs for the 1990 survey were very reasonable but some points are worth noting for future surveys.  (1) Distance of plot to nearby features often not given. Many such features, whilst not sufficiently fixed to be used as prime locators, would have been very useful in practice.  (ii) Directions, and especially compass bearings, were often given from the plot to nearby features rather than vice versa. This made relocation especially difficult.  (1ii) Whilst in unenclosed situations, the photographs and sketches often enabled one to get very close to the actual location and were efficient in preventing the re-survey of adjacent but totally dissimilar habitat types, relocation would often have been greatly assisted iff distances and compass bearings had been included on the sketch for features identifiable in the photograph. Ideally time should be made available for the surveyors to annotate photos taken during the survey,  24 =e  . — Jt anata!  61.  62.  63.  64.  65.  The relocation rate for the metal plates was sufficiently high to consider their use a success. However, the relocation of plates in unenclosed uplands was very time-consuming; 30 minutes per plot was not unusual. If the system is to be retained for such areas extra man power would by required for relocation in future surveys.  Difficulties in location and orientation were particularly pronounced for the 'Y' plots. An improved technique for quadrat positioning on the ground has been recommended (Recommendation 5). Photographs of the location of the plot should clearly show the 2x2m area delineated on the ground. Nearby distinguishing features should be shown both on the photograph and on the accompanying sketch map (Recommendation 3). It is felt that such modifications would enhance the efficiency of recording of these small quadrats.  Although species identification was in general very adequate, errors associated with the recording of species, especially grasses having broadly similar vegetative characteristics and the failure’ to consistently record the allowable bryophytes, suggest that these groups should be targeted both during future training course and in the early stages of a QA exercise. Additional allowable bryophytes may be considered necessary where survey is restricted to individual habitats, especially in the context of the National Vegetation Classification, which relies heavily on bryophyte species in wetland/mire communities. Additional species which might need to be added to the list for other habitat-specific surveys might include;  Homalothecium lutescens and Ctenidium molluscum in calcareous grassland  Tortula ruraliformis and Brachythecium albicans on sand dunes  Fontinalis antipyretica and Rhynchostegium riparioides in running waters and Schistidium maritimum on coastal rocks.  The high level of species mis~-matches apparently due to variations in climatic conditions between year serves to emphasise the need for future QA to be made in the same year as the actual survey. Discrepancies due to summer versus autumn recording within a single year though less pronounced remain significant and should be avoided. QA should thus be restricted to the season and year of original survey (see also Recommendation 2).  With respect to landuse mapping and especially in view of the possibility of relating natural vegetation to the National Vegetation Classification the number of primary codes should be increased and the field surveyors provided with simple dichotomous keys to allow for unambiguous recording. Less emphasis during the mapping exercise should be given to the cover of individual species present. Only cover fur the most prevalent species should be recorded. This would almost certainly result in more reproducible mapping (Recommendation 12).  25 ee  —te-  References Bunce, R.G.H. and Shaw, M.W. (1973). A standardised procedure for ecological surtvey.

supporting_documentation_for_hydroscape_lakedistrict_core_xrf_qc.docx   210Pb dating and 137Cs measurements  Lead-210 (half-life 22.3 year) is a naturally produced radionuclide, derived from atmospheric fallout (termed unsupported 210Pb). Cesium-137 (half-life 30 years) and 241Am are artificially produced radionuclides, introduced to the study area by atmospheric fallout from nuclear weapons testing and nuclear reactor accidents. They have been extensively used in the dating of recent sediments. Dried sediment samples were analysed for 210Pb, 226Ra, 137Cs and 241Am by direct gamma assay in the Environmental Radiometric Facility at University College London, using ORTEC HPGe GWL series well-type coaxial low background intrinsic germanium detector. Lead-210 was determined via its gamma emissions at 46.5keV, and 226Ra by the 295keV and 352keV gamma rays emitted by its daughter isotope 214Pb following 3 weeks storage in sealed containers to allow radioactive equilibration. Cesium-137 and 241Am were measured by their emissions at 662keV and 59.5keV (Appleby et al, 1986). The absolute efficiencies of the detector were determined using calibrated sources and sediment samples of known activity. Corrections were made for the effect of self-absorption of low energy gamma rays within the sample (Appleby et al, 1992). 210Pb chronologies were calculated using the CRS (constant rate of 210Pb supply) dating model (Appleby and Oldfield, 1978; Appleby, 2001).

The eight stage non-viable Andersen sampler was used for the size fractionation of endotoxin. Each stage was loaded with a glass fibre filter and two Andersen’s were run together for 1 hour for each sample with the exception of source sampling at the compost and farm sites where 1 sampler was run for 15 minutes for each sample. The Andersen size fractionates the sample into the following stages:  For ease of analysis and to reduce the overall number of samples the filters were analysed together in the following size fractions:  Each set of filters was assigned a letter so generally A and B were run at the same time for the first hour, then C and D for the second hour and E and F for the third hour. The sampling files give more information on this for each sampling visit.

Nurdle characteristics with associated bacterial concentrations and virulence of Klebsiella isolates from Scottish beaches, 2022 What has been recorded and what form does the data take?  Data was collected for a study looking at the realistic environmental concentrations of potential pathogens colonising microplastic beads on Scottish beaches.

Microplastic beads were collected from ten Scottish beaches (1 Montrose, 2 Broughty Ferry, 3 Yellowcraig, 4 Portobello, 5 Eyemouth, 6 Erskine, 7 Largs, 8 Turnberry, 9 Ayr, and 10 Irvine).  Figure 1 Map of sampling locations (black points) on the east and west coasts of Scotland When were the data were collected? Microplastic beads were collected during November 2022 How were the data collected?  Sample collection Microplastic beads (polyethylene [PE] and polystyrene [PS] beads) were collected on five days in November 2022 using sterile forceps and placed into sterile sample bags.  Microplastic beads were sorted by material (PE or PS), and PE beads further separated by colour; only white PE beads were analysed in this study as they were the most abundant colour collected.  Sites where fewer than 10 microplastic beads of each polymer were collected were excluded from further analysis due to too few replicates. Bacteria were quantified using selective media.  Samples were vortexed vigorously at 1500 rpm for three min and the wash solution removed.  Next, 5 ml of fresh phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was added to the particles and vortexed again before the two wash solutions were combined.  The wash solutions were directly filtered through 0.45 µm cellulose acetate membrane filters (Sartoris Stedim Biotech., Gottingen, Germany) and transferred onto the surface of selective media (Campylobacter blood free agar [CA] [plus CCDA supplement] for Campylobacter; membrane lactose glucuronide agar [MLGA] for E.  coli; Slantez and Bartley agar [SB] for Intestinal enterococci; Klebsiella ChromoSelect agar [KCA] for Klebsiella spp.; Pseudomonas base agar [PA] [plus CN supplement] for P.  aeruginosa; bismuth sulfite agar [BSA] for Salmonella spp.; and thiosulfate citrate bile salts sucrose agar [TCBS] for Vibrio spp.  [Oxoid, UK]).  All plates were inverted and incubated; CA plates were incubated at 37°C for 48 h under microaerophilic conditions (Campy GEN Sachet; Oxoid, UK); MLGA plates incubated at 37°C for 24 h; SB plates incubated at 44°C for 44 h, KCA plates incubated at 37°C for 24 h; PA plates incubated at 35°C for 48 h; BSA plates incubated at 37°C for 48 h; and TCBS incubated at 37°C for 24 h.  After incubation, positive colony forming units (CFU) were enumerated. Salinity, electrical conductivity (EC) and turbidity were measured with, a salinity refractometer (RGBS), HI2550 EC meter and HI88703 turbidimeter respectively (Hanna Instruments, UK). Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry (FTIR) was conducted on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet is50 FTIR (Thermo Scientific, USA) to identify polymer composition. Isolate sequencing and bioinformatics analysis DNA was extracted from Klebsiella isolates using a Genomic DNA purification kit (Monarch, UK), and quantified, and the purity assessed using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, UK); integrity was assessed by running through a 1.5% agarose gel.  Ligation sequencing libraries were prepared using the NEBNext ONT Companion Module (New England Biolabs, UK) and the Native Barcoding Kit 24 (SQK-NBD112.24; Oxford Nanopore Technologies, UK), following the manufacturers protocols.  The library was sequenced for 48 h using an Oxford Nanopore MinION (Mk1C) flowcell (FLO-MIN106; Oxford Nanopore Technologies, UK).  Guppy (v6.3.8) was used to perform the basecalling in Fast mode with reads displaying Q> 8 and > 1000 bp length used for further analysis.Genomes were assembled into contigs using Geneious software (Auckland, New Zealand); briefly, reads were trimmed using BBDuk, normalised using BBNorm and assembled using Flye [1].  Annotation of the assembled genomes was carried out in K Base (Department of Energy Systems Biology Knowledgebase, USA) and the Center for Genomic Epidemiology (DTU National Food Institute, Denmark), to assess completeness and contamination of the genome (CheckM, v 1.0.18; [2]), determine species ID (GTDBtk, v 1.7.0; GTDB R06-RS202; [3]), build a phylogenetic tree (SpeciesTree, v 2.2.0; [4]), predict pathogenicity (PathogenFinder, v 1.1; [5]), and determine the presence of virulence genes (VirulenceFinder, v 2.0; [6], [7], [8]), resistance genes (ResFinder, v 4.1; [9], [6], [10]), plasmids (PlasmidFinder, v 2.0.1, Enterobacteriales database; [6], [11]) and viruses (VirSorter, v 1.0.5; [12]).  Taxonomy was confirmed for the combined assemblies, which included the replicates from each substrate.  Once the replicates had been confirmed to be the same species, the replicate with the most complete genome was then selected for further analysis. Galleria mellonella model of infection: G.  mellonella larvae (Livefood, UK) were kept in darkness at 15°C and used within one week of purchase.  Healthy larvae showing no signs of melanisation and measuring between 2.0 and 2.5 cm in length were used for all experiments using methods adapted from Ormsby et al., [13].  Glycerol stocks of Klebsiella from Site 2 were grown overnight in LB (37°C, 120 rpm, 24 h); these same cultures were used for sequencing (described above).  To ensure that bacterial cells were in their exponential growth phase when injected into Galleria, 500 μl overnight cultures were added to LB (5 ml) and grown at 37°C, with shaking (120 rpm) to an OD600 of 0.2.  Cells were then centrifuged (3000 rpm, 5 min) and resuspended in PBS.  Serial dilutions in PBS were carried out, plated on KCA selective media and incubated (as above) for retrospective enumeration.  To determine virulence of each of the selected Klebsiella strains following their isolation from the microplastic beads and sand, groups of 10 larvae were injected with 10 μl of bacteria (approximately 104 to 106 CFU) using a 100 μl Hamilton syringe (Bonaduz, Switzerland) with a 0.6 × 30 mm needle.  Bacteria were injected into the hemocoel via the last right pro-limb, with all experiments conducted in biological triplicate.  Needles were sterilised between samples by flushing with 70% ethanol followed by PBS.  As a positive control, a reference clinical pathogenic strain of K.  pneumoniae (strain ATCC 13883) was also included.  A buffer negative control of 10 μl PBS was used to account for mortality caused by physical injury or infection caused by a contaminant.  After injection, larvae were incubated at 37°C and inspected 24, 48 and 72 h post-injection; larvae were considered dead when they did not respond to touch stimuli. Why were the data collected? For what purpose? For a study looking at the realistic environmental concentrations of potential pathogens colonising microplastic beads on Scottish beaches. To fulfil the requirements of the UKRI Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) grants: “Microbial hitchhikers of marine plastics: the survival, persistence & ecology of microbial communities in the ‘Plastisphere’” [grant number NE/S005196/1], and the NERC-GCRF SPACES project [grant number NE/V005847/1].

The UKCEH Land Cover Maps for 2017,  2018 and 2019        v1.6  18/06/2020 1    Purpose  This is the user guide for three new UKCEH Land Cover Maps (LCMs): LCM2017, LCM2018 and  LCM2019.  Each new UKCEH LCM represents a range of geospatial datasets.  The content and structure  of each are explained.  Appropriate use of complex data requires a deeper understanding than  structure and content.  We therefore describe how the data were produced and validated, some of  the reasons behind production decisions and outline some future plans.  Our goal is to help users make  informed decisions regarding the application UKCEH LCM data in their current and future work.

Bootstrap Training datasets are used by a Random Forest to classify Classification Scenes.  Context Raster: A multi-band raster with contextual information, such as terrain, coastal and urban  proximity.  Context Rasters are combined with Seasonal Composite Images to create Classification  Scenes.  Classification Scene:  A multi-layer raster comprising spectral information from a Seasonal Composite  Image and Context Rasters.  Classification Scenes are classified to yield a pixel land cover classification.  Seasonal Composite Image: A multi-band raster representing spectral observations across four  seasons.  These are designed to provide seasonal phenology which a classifier can use to differential  vegetation types.    UKCEH Aggregate Land Cover Classes:  A set of land cover classes that generalise the detail provided  in UK CEH Land Cover Classes.    UKCEH Land Cover Classes: A set of land cover classes defined by UKCEH, derived from the UK  Biodiversity Action Plan Broad Habitats (Jackson et. al. 2000)  UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework: A polygon database of land parcel objects derived from  generalising national cartography in order to remove unnecessary detail.  All UKCEH LCM Land Parcel  datasets use this spatial framework.  Introduction  UKCEH has previously released four national land cover maps (LCMs): The Land Cover Map of Great  Britain for 1990 (usually referred to as LCM1990) and UK land cover maps LCM2000, LCM2007 and  LCM2015.  This document accompanies the release of three new UKCEH LCMs to extend this series:   LCM2017, LCM2018 and LCM2019.  Land cover in the new products is given as 21 UKCEH Land Cover  Classes based upon Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats (Jackson, 2000) and match classes  used for UKCEH LCM2015.  UKCEH LCMs 2017, 2018 and 2019 were created automatically using a  technique we call Bootstrap Training combined with a Random Forest classier.  For each new map we  classified Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Images generated using the Google Earth Engine  representing median reflectance per season.  Before classification these images were combined with  ten Context Layers, which helped to reduce spectral confusion, to create Classification Scenes.  The  new automatic methods enable us to produce UK-wide land cover maps very rapidly. Historically,  because of high costs associated with labour intensive image pre-processing and gathering training  data, there has been lag of approximately 10 years between UKCEH LCMs.  Going forward we intend  to release a new LCM every year.    Errors occur in all land cover products and for earlier UKCEH LCMs we performed significant manual  corrections in regions where classification errors were obvious or prolific.  There were no manual  corrections this time.  Classification is automatic and we cannot achieve annual maps if we undertake  significant manual steps.  Annual maps are important to understand land cover change.  Classification  errors are usually randomly distributed in space, due for example to vagaries in image quality or  viewing conditions, so the same errors should not occur in the same location year after year.    Therefore, as the time series of maps develops real land cover changes should persist and be visible  against background noise. 3    Despite the lack of manual accuracy corrections be assured that visual checks and formal validation  exercises were performed on the new land cover maps (Appendix 5).  These indicate that the new  maps are of similar quality to the most recent predecessor, LCM2015.    In this text we have introduced some UKCEH terminology and have adopted the convention of  capitalising their first letters.  This is so you know we are referring to something defined and specific  rather than a more general use of language.  We do not guarantee that these will have been explained  before they are first encountered but in most cases this should not cause confusion.  However, if at  any point you come across capitalised terminology and you are not sure exactly what we mean please  be reassured and read on; it should become clear.  We have also provided a glossary for a quick  refresh.     UK CEH Land Cover Classes and BAP Broad Habitat Classes  LCM2017, LCM2018 and LCM2019 map 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes.  These are the same classes  used in LCM2015 and a near exact match to LCM2007 (Morton et. al., 2011) and LCM2000 classes.   They are based on UK Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats (Jackson et. al., 2000).  But they  are not UK BAP Broad Habitats.  They are similar.  BAP Broad Habitats were designed for field-based  detection by botanists, not remote sensors orbiting the Earth at an altitude of circa 800km.  We cannot  therefore detect them exactly, but we do our best.   In the early 2000s conservation and regulatory agencies had reporting obligations under the UK BAP  and were co-funding stakeholders of LCM2000 and LCM2007.  For this reason LCM2000 and LCM2007  were based on BAP.  New land cover and habitat descriptions have become available in recent years  and some of these are certainly better suited for detection by remote sensors.  Moreover, in 2012 the  UK government published a new biodiversity strategy and the BAP became obsolete.  Despite this, we  have stayed close to the BAP.  We are not resistant to change.   But when it comes to changing the  way we describe land cover we need to be careful not to devalue the sequence for land cover change  detection.  It is easiest to compare like with like.  [For readers interested in land cover change:  UKCEH have recently created a revised UK-wide 1990  Land Cover Map to support comparisons with LCM2015 and newer products.  With the revised  LCM1990 we also provide quarter-Century, UK-wide change datasets.  These and supporting  documents became available simultaneously with the products described here.  Please visit the UKCEH  Environmental Information Platform for more information]  Describing complex land cover and habitat types that share similar nomenclatures and similar (but not  equal) meanings precisely with words can be confusing for the writer, so definitely the readers.  In  most cases we could refer to UKCEH Land Cover Classes and BAP Broad Habitats as if they are one  without causing confusion but sometimes we need to contrast them and it can get messy.  To reduce  ambiguity regarding land cover and habitat descriptions we therefore italicise UK BAP Broad Habitats  when explicitly referring to these and at all times when referring to a defined class (UKCEH or UK BAP)  we will begin each element with a capital letter. For example:  Improved Grassland refers to the UKCEH  Land Cover Class, Improved Grassland the BAP Broad Habitat.    Some users do not require the thematic detail of UKCEH Land Cover Classes so we also provide  generalised land cover, UK CEH Aggregate Classes.  Table 1 shows the relationship between UKCEH  Land Cover Classes and Aggregate Classes with the UK BAP Broad Habitats.  Usually there is a one-to- one relationship between UK BAP Broad Habitats and derived UKCEH Land Cover Classes.  However,  the UK BAP Standing water and Canals and the UK BAP Rivers and Streams are represented by a single  UKCEH Land Cover Class, Freshwater.  There is not a UK BAP for saltwater, but we separate saltwater 4    and freshwater when possible, so include a UKCEH LCM Saltwater class.  In three cases, we have found  it appropriate to refine UK BAP Broad Habitats.  The UK BAP Dwarf Shrub and Heath class is split into  UKCEH Land Cover Classes Heather, and Heather Grassland.  The UK BAP Built up Areas and Gardens  class is split into UKCEH Land Cover Classes Urban and Suburban.  For UK BAP Littoral Sediment we  have been able to detect Saltmarsh, which matches a UK BAP Priority Habitat subclass of Littoral  Sediment. Fuller details of class derivations, motivations for these and issues associated with their  detection are given by Appendix 1 and 2.  Table 1 Relationship between UK CEH Aggregate classes, UK BAP Broad Habitats (Jackson 2000, highlighted in green) and  UKCEH Land Cover class and associated integer identifiers.  Additional notes on the on the relationships between UKCEH  Land Cover Classes and UK BAP Broad Habitats are given in Appendices 1 and 2 together with satellite-based mapping  considerations.

This time we include classified pixels (at 20m resolution) from which all the  remaining products are derived.  The ancestry of datasets is shown by Figure 1, with additional detail  and metadata provided by Table 2.  For each dataset there is a Great Britain version in the British  National Grid (EPSG:27700) and a Northern Ireland Version in the Irish National Grid (EPSG:29903).   This product suite is duplicated for each year giving a total 42 datasets (see Appendix 6 for the  complete list).  Text subsections below give more detailed descriptions for each dataset and highlight  minor differences from LCM2015.      Figure 1  Shows UKCEH LCM dataset structure within this product release and at each level the number of classes (21 or  UKCEH Land Cover Classes, 10 for UKCEH Aggregate Classes) represented by the dataset.  20m Classified Pixels  These were not present in LCM2015 or earlier products.  They are the new addition to the UKCEH LCM  product suite.  They are Random Forrest (RF) classification results from the 20m pixel Sentinel-2  Classification Scenes.  All remaining products were derived from the 20m Classified Pixels datasets by  summarising pixel information using the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework.  The 20m Classified Pixels datasets are provided as 2-band, 8-bit integer rasters.  The RF classifier  assigns each pixel a probability of membership for each of the 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes.  The  nominate land cover, band 1, is the class with the highest membership probability.  Band 2 is this  probability, but rescaled and rounded giving an integer value over the range of 0 to 100 to allow 8-bit  integer representation.  This gives an indication of per-pixel classification confidence (uncertainty);  high values equate to high confidence low uncertainty.   Unlike pixels of the 25m Rasterised Land Parcels datasets the 20m Classified Pixels have not been  generalised by combination with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework.  This preserves intricate  features of the landscape such as narrow linear features and small patches of habitat that fall below  the 0.5 hectare minimum mappable unit (MMU).  We anticipate that this extra detail will be of interest  and useful. 6    Land Parcels  The Land Parcels datasets are the result of intersecting the 20m Classified Pixels datasets with the  UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework to generate land parcel attributes, see Table 3.  There have  been some minor attribute changes since LCM2015, these are also described.  NOTE: Depending on  how you receive the Land Parcels dataset, there may be an additional numeric identifier field.  This  will have been imposed by the specification of the file format in which data were supplied to you, and  has no relevance.  We only describe the attributes that we have derived.  Table 3.  UKCEH LCM Land Parcel dataset attributes for LCMs 2017-2019 and the corresponding UKCEH LCM2015 attributes  in brackets for comparison.  UK  CEH  LCM  attribute  name  (LCM2015 name)  Example  Description  gid (gid)  10079  This is a unique identifier for the land  parcel geometry maintained in UK CEH  Land Parcel Spatial Framework  _hist (Pix_dist)  2:3, 11:361  This describes the frequency of 20m  pixels per UK CEH land cover class  encountered in a land parcel given as  a list of tuples <left>:<right> separated  by commas.    The figure to the left of  the colon per tuple represents the  UKCEH Land Cover Class identifier, to  the right the frequency of occurrence.   For example in this land parcel we  predicted that 3 pixels of Coniferous  Woodland (2) and 361 of Bog (11).  _mode (Mode)  11  This is the most frequently occurring  (modal) land cover type.  _purity (Modal_prop)  99.06  This is the percentage of the modal  land cover class over the total number  of pixels (_n) encountered.  _conf (unc)  93.88  This when combined with _purity  helps to understand classification  confidence.  It is the mean value of the  class membership probability for each  pixel, rescaled to the range of 0 to 100.  _stdev (Unc_stdev)  9.51  This is the standard deviation of _conf.  _n (npix)  319  This is the total number 20m pixels  intersecting  the land parcel    Differences since UKCEH LCM2015.  The attribute names of the new products do not match those of  LCM2015.  Corresponding LCM2015 attribute names are shown by Table 2 in brackets.  The attribute  names were changed to align with naming conventions used in our production software and internal  documents.  This was done to simplify production.  We hope it does not cause user inconvenience.  gid. The gid is a unique identifier for each land parcel and its name is unchanged between products.   However, gid values of the new products will not match those of the LCM2015 land parcels.  The  reasons for this is given in the section describing the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework. 7    _hist.  The presentation of the histogram data, _hist, has been improved.  Previously it was given as  list of 21 counts, one for each land cover class, inclusive of zeros.  This was untidy and very difficult to  read compared to the new tuple structure.  _purity.  The _purity attribute was previously given as a proportion, instead of a percentage.  _purity  is carried into the 25m Rasterised Land Parcel dataset, which is an 8-bit integer raster.  A floating value  over the range of 0-1 would degrade to binary information when converted into an integer, so we now  represent this as a percentage.  _conf. In LCM2015 _conf was scaled over 0 to 255, it is now scaled 0 to 100 as this is more intuitive to  most users.  The LCM2015 Land Parcel dataset included an extra BHAB attribute, which is a textual description of  the habitat.  This was an unnecessary duplication of information.  The dominant per-parcel UKCEH  Land Cover Class is provided by the _mode, so a straightforward lookup can be used for corresponding  text descriptions.  The LCM2015 Land Parcels dataset included an attribute called Composite, which identified the main  twin-date composite image from which the land parcel’s class was derived.  Since the new products  are derived from seamless composite images produced by the Google Earth Engine this attribute no  longer has relevance and has been removed.   25m Rasterised Land Parcels  These are the result of rasterising the Land Parcels datasets into 25m pixels, with the pixel origin  matching the origin of the British National Grid or the Irish National Grid.  Three attributes are carried  from the Land Parcels datasets, giving a 3-band raster.  Band 1 is the dominant land cover _mode;  band 2 is _conf; and band 3 _purity.    Differences since UKCEH LCM2015.  In the LCM2015 25m Rasterised Land Parcel dataset only the  _mode and _conf were rasterised, to give a 2-band raster.  We consider that the _purity band provides  useful information relating to the classification confidence so we include this as a third band in the  new product.  We expect that users will find this useful.  1km Rasters   A 1km grid, with an origin matching the origin of British National Grid or the Irish National Grid was  used to intersect the 25m Rasterised Land Parcels.  All 25m pixels within each 1km square were  accumulated to derive the following 1km Raster datasets:  1km Percent Cover.  This is a 21-band, 8-bit integer raster giving the percentage cover of each UKCEH  Land Cover class per 1km.  1km Percent Aggregate Cover.  This is a 10-band, 8-bit integer raster product giving the percentage  cover of each UKCEH Aggregate Land Cover Class per 1km.  1km Dominant Cover.  This is a single band, 8-bit integer raster giving the dominant UKCEH Land Cover  Class per 1km grid square.  1km Dominant Aggregate Cover.  This is a 1-band, 8-bit integer raster giving the dominant UKCEH  Aggregate Land Cover Class per 1km grid square. 8    For the percentage cover products, integer values are reported, so the rounding of each value means  that in some cases the sum of all the layers may be slightly above or below 100. Around the coast the  values will be sum to less than 100 reflecting the proportion of mapped area in the 1km square. One  1km x 1km pixel covers the area of 1600 25m pixels, consequently, a land cover type has to cover  more than sixteen 25m-pixels to exceed 1% of the 1km pixel area and hence have a percentage cover  value in the 1km percentage cover data sets.    Dataset examples  Here we provide figures to clarify dataset explanations.  UKCEH Land Cover Classes are coloured  according to our recommended scheme given in Appendix 3.  Figure 2 gives example datasets of the 20m Classified Pixels, Land Parcels and 25m Rasterised Land  Parcels. The 20m Classified Pixel dataset preserves detail lost in the Land Parcels and 25m Rasterised  Land Parcels. Land Parcel boundaries are dissolved in 25m dataset.  The 20m Classified Pixel dataset  has two bands: band 1 gives the most likely UKCEH Land Cover Class; band 2 the membership  probability of this class over a grey-scale: 0 black, 100 white.  The Land Parcel product has a range of  attributes (see Table 3) within a single example given.  The 25m Pixel Rasterised Land Parcels have 3  bands: band 1 the modal UKCEH Land Cover Classes from the Land Parcels dataset (_mode); band 2  the parcel-averaged pixel membership probability (the _conf attribute from the Land Parcels); and  band 3 the parcel purity (the _purity attribute from the Land Parcels dataset).    Figure 2. Examples of 20m Classified Pixels, Land Parcels and 25m Rasterised Land Parcels.  Note the extra granularity and  detail of the 20m Classified Pixels over the 25m Rasterised Land Parcels.  The Land Parcel dataset highlights the parcel  boundaries, which are dissolved in the 25m Rasterised Land Parcel dataset.  It is not informative to display the full list of raster bands for 1km datasets, nor all datasets.  The text  descriptions combined with the Figure 3 should be sufficient.  Figure 3 juxtaposes the 1km Dominant 9    Cover with the 25m Rasterised Land Parcels showing UKCEH Land Cover Classes to provide an example  of the generalisation effect of the 1km dataset.  Also provided is and a single band representing  Improved Grassland of the 21-band 1km Percent Cover raster.  Please refer to the colour key in Figure  2 the UKCEH Land Cover Classes.  The 1km Percent Cover is on a grey-scale: 0 black, 1 white.    Figure 3.  Juxtaposed 25m a 1km products to show the generalisation effect of the 1km Dominant Cover product.  Also a 1- band example of the 21-band Percent Cover product (0 black, 1 white).  Material and Methods  Seasonal Composite Images  Seasonal Composite Images for classification were derived from Google Earth Engine.  Median top of  atmosphere reflectance (TOA) values resampled to 20m pixel resolution were computed for each  season: winter (January-March), spring (April-June), summer (July-September), and autumn (October- December) using nine Sentinel-2 bands 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, and 12 (after Carrasco et. al., 2019)  identified by Table 4. There were some seasonal gaps in the Seasonal Composite Images, because of  excessive cloud, and these were represented by null data.  Fortunately, this never occurred across all  seasons at a single location, so at least some Sentinel-2 satellite data were available for all locations.   Our classification algorithm will tolerate partially incomplete spectral information, so we were able to  produce land cover for the whole of the UK without the need to manually fill gaps (manual gap filling  was necessary for all previous UKCEH land cover maps).  It is possible that full 4-season gaps at a single  location will occur in the future (but rarely based on current experience) and we are exploring the  opportunities for filling these gaps with classifications of alternative optical sources and multi- temporal Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar, which is relatively insensitive to clouds and weather. 10    Table 4  Sentinel-2 spectral bands and spatial resolutions      The Google Earth Engine now provides Sentinel-2 data as land surface reflectance (SR) and coverage  of this collection is expanding.  However, during production these data were not fully available across  all years for the whole UK, so after assessing the potential benefits of SR over TOA we chose to use  TOA, since SR brought no improvements when classifying to UKCEH Land Cover Classes.  Whether this  relationship will hold when seeking higher thematic detail, we do not know.  In the future we are likely  to increase the range of land surface information products so we will continuously review satellite  input choices.  Context Rasters  Spectral confusion can occur between different land cover types that have similar spectral properties.   For example, bare rocks in the littoral coastal zone lack significant vegetation, so too do exposed  mountain rocks and sealed urban surfaces.  Spectrally these surfaces can appear very similar when  viewed from space.  Contextual information provides additional clues for the RF’s learning algorithm  to separate spectrally similar land cover types and for the above example coastal proximity, urban  proximity and terrain context would clearly help.  We used 20m Context Rasters to resolve a range of  confusion types.  For Great Britain the 20m Context Rasters were:  1. Height, derived from the NEXTMap® terrain product from Intermap® Solutions  2. Aspect, derived from the NEXTMap® terrain product from Intermap® Solutions  3. Slope, derived from the NEXTMap® terrain product from Intermap® Solutions  4. Distance from the nearest building, derived from Ordnance Survey open data  5. Distance from road, derived from Ordnance Survey open data  6. Distance from sea, derived from Ordnance Survey open data  7. Distance from freshwater, derived from Ordnance Survey  open data  8. A foreshore binary mask, derived from Ordnance Survey open data  9. A tidal water binary mask, derived from Ordnance Survey open data  10. A woodland binary mask, derived from Ordnance Survey open data.  For Northern Ireland 20m Context Rasters were: 11    1. Height, derived from the NEXTMap® terrain product from Intermap® Solutions  2. Aspect, derived from the NEXTMap® terrain product from Intermap® Solutions  3. Slope, derived from the NEXTMap® terrain product from Intermap® Solutions  4. An urban binary mask derived from open data of the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research  Agency  5. A distance to coast layer derived from the Ordnance Survey or Northern Ireland open data  6. A distance to freshwater layer derived from the Ordnance Survey or Northern Ireland open  data  7. A distance to road layer derived from the Ordnance Survey or Northern Ireland open data.  Classification Scenes  For Great Britain a patchwork of overlapping 100x100km tiles was created (Figure 4).  These were  used to select and extract 36-band Seasonal Composite Images from the Google Earth Engine.  These  were then combined with the Context Rasters to give a set of 100x100km 46-band GB Classification  Scenes.  In total we classified 74 overlapping Classification Scenes whose combined area significantly  exceeds the total area of the GB land surface.   Each Classification Scene was trained and classified  independently.  Classification Scenes were overlapped to ensure that each had a good range and  balance of training observations to maximise classification accuracy.  In regions where overlaps  occurred the same region will have been classified multiple times.  Where this occurred there will have  been slight variations in results because of different training.  Visual inspection was used to determine  precedence so that the best results made it into the final cut; this is the only manual judgement in the  GB UK CEH LCM production process.  The 100x100km tile size was chosen because it provides a  manageable size for processing.  Moreover, if regions were much larger phenological variation due to  climatic difference across a Classification Scene could begin to degrade results.    For Northern Ireland, because of its much smaller area, it was possible (and much easier) to use a  single 43-band (36 spectral and 7 context layers) Classification Scene for each year determined by the  minimum bounding rectangle of the Northern Ireland land mass (Figure 4).    The UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework  The UK Land Parcel Spatial Framework used for LCM2017, LCM2018 and LCM2019 was originally  developed for LCM2007 (Morton et. al., 2011) and a modified version was used for LCM2015.  For the  new products we had to make further minor changes.  The total number of land parcels and their  geometries are unchanged, they are an exact match to those used in LCM2015, but we have re- ordered database storage and defined new indices to enable faster processing.  The consequence of  this is that the unique identifiers (the gid attribute) for each land parcel do not match those provided  in the LCM2015 Land Parcels dataset.  For most users this will have no significance, but for users who  wish to compare the new land cover with LCM2015 using parcel identifiers, instead of spatial overlap,  this will not be possible.  We apologise if this causes inconvenience.  LCM2017 to LCM2019 land parcel  comparisons can be made using the gid.   Land parcels in the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework have a minimum area of approximately 0.5  hectares, the minimum mappable unit, MMU.  The land parcels were derived by generalising national  cartography (Morton et. al., 2011; Smith et. al., 2007) and are designed to represent discrete real- world units of land such as fields, parks, urban areas, woodlands, lakes and so forth.  It is usual, but  not universal, that the land parcels are dominated by a single land cover type.  Therefore organising  the 20m Classified Pixels into land parcels helps to reduce classification noise to provide a clean, easier  to use product.  It also provides a convenient fixed structure for comparing land cover over time for  change detection. 12    The UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework is not the only structure by which the 20m Classified Pixels  dataset could be summarised.  Through providing the 20m Classified Pixels in this release we give  users the option to employ their own parcel structure to summarise land cover.  For example, these  might be catchment boundaries, administrative boundaries, nature reserves and so forth.  In the  future we may refine the UK CEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework as it was originally optimised for  ~30m pixel resolution satellite data used for UKCEH LCM2007.  Current trends are towards higher  spatial resolution, so a finer framework with a reduced MMU will soon become more appropriate.      Figure 4.  100x100km tiles used for selecting Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Images for Great Britain (green) and the single  tile for Northern Ireland (red).  Bootstrap Training  Bootstrapping is used to refer to a self-starting process that proceeds without external input.  UKCEH  have developed a fully automatic training process for land cover/habitat classification that does not  require a fresh collection of (expensive) field-gathered data, so we have named the process Bootstrap  Training.  Land cover and habitat change is usually gradual.  Transitions from one land cover or habitat  to another typically occur over a number of years.  Therefore recent habitat/land cover maps can be  a valuable source of training data for a new map if the original maps are accurate and the update  interval of the new map is short relative to target (land cover class) dynamics. Land cover observations  from the historic maps can be used to sample the current satellite image to produce spectral training  observations.  These are then used by a RF classifier to yield a classification image, which contributes  to the bootstrap for the next map and so forth.  Because the historic UKCEH LCMs give coast-to-coast  coverage they provide can provide a very large number of training observations, which is the key to  learning success.  Machine-learning algorithms, such as RF, rely on the majority signal to assign class  membership, so when the Bootstrap Training set is very large it doesn’t matter if a minor proportion 13    have changed class over the refresh interval since these will have little influence on the dominant  signal.  The Bootstrap Training for UKCEH LCMs 2017, 2018 and 2019 all came from UKCEH LCM2015, and  LCM2015 was derived from a bootstrap sample from stable land cover observations from 1990 to  2007 combined with additional manual observations.  To generate the Bootstrap Training set for  LCM2017-2019 we selected all land parcels from UKCEH LCM2015 with greater than or equal to 99%  purity (the _purity attribute).  As stated earlier, our methods are evolving and Bootstrap Training  strategies are likely change.  Our current intention is that the LCM2020, planned for release in 2021,  will use a bootstrap from the majority signal across 2017 to 2019; similarly the bootstrap for 2021 will  use the 3-year majority signal over 2018 to 2020.  Figure 5 shows an example of a Bootstrap Training  dataset and resultant RF classification result.    Figure 5.  UKCEH Land Cover Classes (left), a Bootstrap Training set derived from UKCEH LCM2015 (centre) and the resultant  RF land cover classification (right).  Random Forest classification  Random Forest (RF) classification (Breiman 2001) is a supervised learning technique that uses a  training set of known observation to derive an empirical relationship that is used to predict the  membership of unknown observations.  Bootstrap Training data derived from UKCEH LCM2015 were  used to sample all underlying pixels from the Classification Scenes for 2017, 2018 and 2019.  Pixels  were placed into labelled bags and from each bag 10,000 samples, with replacement were drawn to  train the RF classifier. The RF classifier subsequently yields the 20m Classified Pixel product (for  example, Figure 3, right).  Sampling with replacement ensures that all land cover classes have an equal  number of pixel observations for training, which balances learning.  Without balanced learning the  signal of rarer classes will be weak and susceptible to domination from commoner classes, causing  misclassification.    The classification software used for UKCEH LCMs 2017 to 2019 is bespoke and was developed by  UKCEH scientific staff.  It integrates the Weka (Frank et. al. 2016) machine learning suite with a PostGIS  geospatial database and gdal tools (https://gdal.org/).  These are all open source technologies.  Product validation  LCM2017, 2018 and 2019 at UK scale were validated by comparison with observations derived from  the GB countryside survey 2019 data, open source National Forest Inventory data, IACS data a set of  bespoke LCM validation points generated from manual image interpretation.  In total, this generated 14    22,325 point locations. These were intersected with UKCEH LCM Land Parcel datasets to determine  correspondence.  The overall accuracy figures from this validation exercise are:   •  LCM2017: 78.6%;   •  LCM2018: 79.6%;   •  LCM2019: 79.4%.  Please note that the same validation data were used for all three products and the currency of  validation points, relative to each product is therefore variable.  Validation observations should not  be considered as absolute truth, but the best available indicators of reality.  A proportion of validation  observations will be incorrect.  Moreover, the validation sample was derived from data sources with  a different purpose and class descriptions that did not match exactly to UKCEH Land Cover Classes.   They needed converting to UKCEH Land Cover Classes and schematic conversions can be subjective.  Given this information ~80% correspondence for UK-wide 21-class automatically produced land cover  maps is very impressive.  We anticipate higher levels of accuracy as methods mature.  We shall also  continue to seek improved validation resources.  Full correspondence tables from the validation are  given in Appendix 5.     References  Breiman, L., 2001. Random forests.

Notes on UKCEH Land Cover Classes   (see also Appendix 2 for a summary of UK BAP Broad Habitat definitions)  UKCEH Land Cover  Class  Notes  Broadleaved  woodland  In the UK BAP Broadleaved, mixed and yew woodland the broad leaved woodlands are  characterised by stands >5 m high with tree cover >20%.  Scrub (<5 m) requires a cover >30% for  inclusion. Such fine distinctions cannot be made through remote sensing. Open-canopy woodland  (stands with trees <50%) is a particular problem, albeit occurring relatively rarely.  These are likely to  be confused with other classes due to the dominance of the non-woodland understory.   Broadleaved evergreen trees rarely occur in stands >0.5 hectares; an area large enough to create  suitable training areas appropriate for classification.  As a consequence the classifier would struggle  with this land cover.  It is likely they will be classified as Conifer because of the full-year chlorophyll  signal.  Mixed woodland stands of broad-leaved or evergreen trees exceeded the minimum mappable unit,  they were treated as separate blocks within the woodland; in many parts of the UK, truly ‘mixed  woodlands’ as opposed to those with mosaic-blocks of broadleaved and coniferous trees, are unusual.  Stands with near-closed canopies can be interpreted easily in the field and pure examples can  normally be found for training the classifier.   Coniferous woodland The UK BAP Coniferous Woodland class includes semi-natural stands and plantations, with cover  >20%. Classification of coniferous woodland is generally straightforward, but rare examples of open  canopy semi-natural pinewoods are likely to be classified according to the dominant understorey  class.   The UK BAP includes new plantation and recently felled areas.  These are land use, not land cover.  Newly felled areas are often dominated by grass, heather and encroaching vegetation and more likely  to be classified as these, instead of coniferous woodland.  Deciduous larch has potential for confusion with broadleaved deciduous woodland but is generally  correctly identified.  Arable  and  Horticulture  The BAP Broad Habitat Arable and Horticulture includes annual crops, perennial crops such as berries  and orchards and freshly ploughed land. This is a very broad class and as a consequence has large  potential for spectral confusion with non-arable surfaces.  The main confusion between arable and  other classes occurs between arable land and improved grassland.  This is especially likely when  grassland is managed by cutting, followed by periods of low growth and reflectance from chlorophyll.  When this happens the observed seasonal reflectance pattern can be similar to graminid crops, such  as wheat and barley.  Indeed grass managed in this way is technically a crop, so an arable classification  isn’t necessarily wrong.  Improved Grassland    Improved grassland is distinguished from semi-natural grasslands based on its higher productivity,  lack of winter senescence, location and/or context.  Grasslands lie on a continuum, so some confusion  with other grassland types is inevitable.  Confusion with grass-like crops will also occur.  Neutral Grassland    The UK BAP Broad Habitat Neutral Grassland we expected to be troublesome for satellite-based  classification, and we had considered removing it from our scheme.  BAP Neutral Grassland is defined  by botanical composition and includes semi-improved grasslands managed for silage, hay or pasture  (Jackson, 2000).  There isn’t generally an obvious spectral difference between these and other  productive grass types.  However, the inclusion of Context Rasters for slope and distance to rivers  appear to have helped greatly with Neutral Grassland detection.  We were surprised: validation results  are better than expected for this class. 16    Calcareous Grassland    Calcareous Grassland class is mapped spectrally.  However, the inclusion of ancillary layers for slope  is expected to improve results.  We do not have free access to a highly resolved soil PH/soil type layer,  which we would expect to help further.  For regions know to contain substantial coverage of  Calcareous Grassland, for example Limestone Dales of Derbyshire and North Yorkshire, the South  Downs and Salisbury Plain our results match expectations.   Acid Grassland  The UK BAP Acid Grassland can be spectrally variable, depending on dominant species composition.  Deciduous Acid grassland, dominated by Molinea caerula has a distinct signal from more species  diverse acid grasslands with mixtures of grasses, rushes, mosses, herbs and sedges. In other work we  have been able to refine this class successfully. However, we did not make this separation in historical  maps, so we are not able to retrieve suitable observations from Bootstrap Training.    Bracken has a very distinctive spectral signal, but only at certain times of the year when its foliage  begins to dominate its grassland understory.  Historically, with restricted availability of satellite images  we could not reliably separate the UK BAP Bracken class from Acid Grassland so we combined these  into a single UKCEH Land Cover Class.  With the greater image frequency and therefore better access  to seasonal signals it may now be possible to overcome this limitation, but to do this we will need  novel training data as we will not be able to retrieve a signal from Bootstrap Training as we do not  mapped Bracken in recent UKCEH LCMs.  Heather;  and Heather grassland    For LCM2007 we refined the BAP Dwarf Shrub and Heath into two classes, depending on the density  of heather, producing the UKCEH Heather and Heather Grassland classes (It is heather when there is  greater than 25% Heather Cover). This was to retain some consistency between the LCM1990 and  LCM2000 classes Open Shrub Heath and Dense Shrub Heath.  In some parts of the UK, significant areas  of low lying non-heather shrubs occur.  For example, Gorse can form a dominant shrub layer.  Here  we would the UKCEH Heather class, although it is a misnomer and perhaps the original LCM1990 and  LCM2000 names would be better.  Note: the Land Cover Maps typically show confusion over Heather and Heather grassland (and Bog  too).  However, they are often difficult to separate in the field.  It is not easy to accurately estimate  coverage above and below the defining threshold.  Fen,  Marsh  and  Swamp  The UK BAP Fen, Marsh and Swamp includes fen, fen meadows, rush pasture, swamp, flushes and  springs. From a remote sensing perspective Fen, Marsh and Swamp is problematic as it is can be  comprised of a wide range of vegetation types and many patches are below the MMU of the UKCEH  Land Parcel Spatial Framework. The small size of many Fen, Marsh and Swamp patches, plus their  typically mosaic nature make it difficult to find reliable training data. Consequently, Fen, Marsh and  Swamp is likely to be underestimated in some regions.  However, substantial areas of contiguous reed  dominated Fenland appear to be well detected.  Bog  The UK BAP Bog includes ericaceous, herbaceous and mossy swards in areas with a peat depth > 0.5  m.  We cannot detect peat depth from satellites.  Vegetation on deep peat soils represent a continuum involving acid grassland, dwarf shrub heath and  some types of fen, marsh and swamp and the separation of continuously varying land cover into  discrete types can be difficult, especially when they exist in a complex small patch mosaic and their  definitions are vague.   We retain the Bog class to maintain consistency with historical UKCEH LCM products and the RF  classifier learns Bog presence based on training data automatically generated from these. The  predicted distribution occurs in regions where it is expected, so is a good indicator of where Bog is  likely to be occurring.  However, Bog and the range of upland vegetation classes expected to occur on  peaty soils (Acid grassland, Fen marsh and swamp, Heather, and Heather grassland) show a cluster of  interclass confusion (Appendix 5).  This is partly due fine-scale variation but largely an effect of  ambiguous definitions.  UK BAP Broad Habitats (on which UKCEH Land Cover Classes are based) were  not defined with satellite remote sensing in mind. 17    A refined set of upland vegetation types for suitable for satellite detection would be preferable.  In  other work UKCEH have found it possible to separate a revised set upland vegetation types with higher  reliability, but the necessary training data is restrictive.  Mapping upland peatland vegetation with higher accuracy is desirable, as peatland vegetation has a  key role in the carbon-cycle, water storage and flood management.  UKCEH remote sensing staff are  engaged in upland habitat studies and intend to bring the benefits of this to future UKCEH LCMs if we  can find adequate training samples.  Saltwater  Saltwater is rarely different spectrally from freshwater, and the Saltwater distribution predicted by  the RF classifier is determined by coastal Context Rasters in Classification Scenes.  There will be some  confusion between Saltwater and Freshwater in tidal rivers, but not substantial.  Occasionally,  Saltwater is confused with non-vegetated surfaces close to the coast and this happens because the  automatically generated Saltwater training classes coincide with the tide being out in the satellite  view.  The effect has so far been trivial but the result is that we predict Saltwater with slightly lower  accuracy than Freshwater. Our main goal is to map land cover so coastal water and intertidal regions  are not high priority  Freshwater      The UK CEH Freshwater class comes from merging two BAP BHs (Standing Open Water and Canals,  and Rivers and Streams) since they cannot be separated by spectra. In many cases small and/or narrow  water bodies fall below the MMU of the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework so effectively  disappear into the dominant surrounding vegetation.  Where these features are appropriately aligned  with the satellite swath and sufficiently wide relative to pixel resolution they may be detected and if  so will be visible in the 20m Classified Pixels datasets.  Water bodies > 0.5 ha and wider than 40m are mapped with very high accuracy. The exceptions are  temporary water bodies and quarries. Water in some quarries is strongly affected by the minerals in  the rock and can result in atypical colours and misclassification.  Inland Rock  The BAP Broad Habitat Inland Rock covers both natural and artificial exposed rock surfaces which are  >0.25ha, such as inland cliffs, caves, screes and limestone pavements, as well as various forms of  excavations and waste tips such as quarries and quarry waste.  Opportunistic vegetation is common  amongst rocky landscapes.  We will classify Inland Rock if rock has the dominant signature.  Urban; and Suburban    Within the Built-up Areas and Gardens BAP Broad Habitat we can reliably separate two UKCEH Land  Cover Classes: Urban and Suburban. Urban includes dense urban, such as town and city centres, where  there is little, if any, vegetation. Urban also includes areas such as dock sides, car parks and industrial  estates. It is sometimes confused with other non-vegetated surfaces; for example open cast quarries  or more rarely coastal rocks or ploughed fields.  Suburban includes suburban areas where the spectral signature is a mix of urban and vegetation  signatures.  Suburban and Urban lie on a continuum and confusion is expected.  Supralittoral Rock  Features that may be present in this coastal class include vertical rock, boulders, gullies, ledges and  pools generally forming a narrow band when viewed from above. Only limited areas can be mapped  using satellite remote sensing.   Supralittoral Sediment This class includes sand-dunes, which are reliably detected. Areas of coastal sand may be confused  between this class and the Littoral Sediment class.  Supralittoral sediments can stabilise and from  increasing volumes of vegetation.  Heavily vegetated Supralittoral Sediment is likely to be assigned to  a vegetation class.   Littoral Rock  This class occurs in the maritime zone on a rocky coastline. It is generally more extensive than  Supralittoral Rock and thus more readily detected using satellite images.   Littoral Sediment; and  Saltmarsh  The BAP Broad Habitat Littoral Sediment has a subclass, the BAP Priority Habitat Saltmarsh. Saltmarsh  is generally distinct from nearby vegetation and only occurs near the coast.  As a consequence we can  map this well with remote sensing.  We therefore include a UKCEH Land Cover Class, Saltmarsh.   The 18        Saltmarsh class is occasionally subject to commission error, when we mistake other vegetation in the  coastal zone (mainly Arable) as Saltmarsh.  This is a result of the coastal context layers being a  powerful effect on Saltmarsh detection, but they solve far more problems than they create.   The Littoral Sediment is sometimes confused with the Supralittoral Sediment class. 19    Appendix 2: Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats   This appendix provides a brief summary of the JNCC definitions of the Broad Habitats and is based on  Jackson (2000).  There is some duplication of material Appendix 2 with Appendix 1.  However in  combination they provide users with key information to understand UKCEH Land Cover Classes and  the Broad Habitat definitions they are based on.  Note: class numbers here are JNCC’s Broad Habitat  class numbers, not UKCEH Land Cover Class numbers.  The text in this Appendix has been copied from Morton et. al., 2011, with very minor updates to  remove obsolete cross-references to historical projects and documents, plus some corrections.  Some  new comments are included regarding BAP Broad Habitat Linear Features and the new 20m Classified  Pixel datasets.  1. Broadleaved, Mixed and Yew Woodland  This Broad Habitat is characterised by vegetation dominated by trees >5m high when mature, with  tree cover >20%. Scrub (<5 m) requires cover >30% for inclusion in this Broad Habitat.  It includes  stands of both native and non-native broadleaved trees and yew. Woodlands dominated by coniferous  species but with >20% cover by deciduous species are included in this category.  Areas of fen woodland  dominated by species such as willow (Salix spp.), alder (Alnus glutinosa) or birch (Betula spp.) are also  included.   2. Coniferous Woodland  This Broad Habitat is characterised by vegetation dominated by trees >5m high when mature, which  forms a canopy having a cover of >20%. ‘Coniferous Woodland’ includes semi-natural stands and  plantations and includes both native and non-native coniferous trees.   3. Boundaries and Linear Features  This Broad Habitat type covers a range of linearly arranged landscape features such as hedgerows,  lines of trees, walls, stone and earth banks, grass strips and dry ditches. These features are not  included as a UKCEH Land Cover Class as they are generally too narrow to be reliably captured from  the satellite images. However, linear features are of general interest and an important component of  the landscape.  Some linear features will be visible in the 20m Classified Pixel dataset.  In future UKCEH  LCMS we are likely to resolve to 10m and more of these features will be visible.   However, regardless of whether or not we can see linear features, we cannot classify them using our  current methods.  Linear features are in fact just thin fragments of the various land cover types that  we already map.  Membership in this class is defined by shape, not spectra.  We don’t have tools for  classifying shapes.  New tools for narrow feature finding within the 20m Classified Pixels products  could help with their detection.  Line finding algorithms are well developed and commonly used in  other areas of remote sensing, mainly for military applications.  4. Arable and Horticulture  This Broad Habitat includes annual crops, perennial crops, woody crops, intensively managed  commercial orchards, commercial horticultural land (such as nurseries, commercial vegetable plots  and commercial flower growing areas), freshly-ploughed land, annual leys, rotational set-aside and  fallow. 20    5. Improved Grassland  ‘Improved Grassland’ is characterised by vegetation dominated by a few fast-growing grasses such as  Lolium spp., and also white clover (Trifolium repens), on fertile, neutral soils.  Improved Grasslands are  typically either managed as pasture or mown regularly for silage production or in non-agricultural  contexts for recreation and amenity purposes.  6. Neutral Grassland  This Broad Habitat type is characterised by vegetation dominated by grasses and herbs on a range of  neutral soils usually with a pH of between 4.5 and 6.5. It includes enclosed dry hay meadows and  pastures, together with a range of grasslands which are periodically inundated with water or  permanently moist.  7. Calcareous Grassland  Calcareous Grassland is characterised by vegetation dominated by grasses and herbs on shallow, well- drained soils which are rich in bases (principally calcium carbonate) formed by the weathering of chalk  and other types of limestone or base-rich rock. Soil pH tends to be high (>6) although it may be as low  as 5.  8. Acid Grassland  Acid Grassland is characterised by vegetation dominated by grasses and herbs on a range of lime- deficient soils which have been derived from acidic bedrock or from superficial deposits such as sands  and gravels. Such soils usually have a low base status, with a pH of <5.5.   9. Bracken   This Broad Habitat type covers areas dominated by a continuous canopy cover of bracken (Pteridium  aquilinum) at the height of the growing season. It does not include areas with scattered patches of  bracken or areas of bracken which are less than 0.25 ha.  These are included in the Broad Habitat type  with which they are associated.   10. Dwarf Shrub Heath  ‘Dwarf Shrub Heath’ is characterised by vegetation that has >25% cover of plant species from the  heath family (ericoids) or dwarf gorse Ulex minor. It generally occurs on well-drained, nutrient-poor,  acid soils.  This habitat type does not include dwarf shrub dominated vegetation in which species  characteristic of peat-forming vegetation such as cotton-grass Eriophorum spp. and peat-building  sphagna are abundant, or that occurs on deep peat (> 0.5 m) as these are included in the 'Bog' Broad  Habitat type.   11. Fen, Marsh and Swamp  This habitat includes fen, flushes, springs, fen meadows, rush pasture and swamp. Fens are peatlands  which receive water and nutrients from groundwater and surface run-off, as well as from rainfall.  Flushes are associated with lateral water movement, and springs with localised upwelling of water.  Marsh is a general term usually used to imply waterlogged soil; it is used more specifically here to  refer to fen meadows and rush-pasture communities on mineral soils and shallow peats. Swamps are  characterised by tall emergent vegetation. Reedbeds (i.e. swamps dominated by stands of common  reed Phragmites australis) are also included in this type.  Apart from rush pasture, examples of this  Broad Habitat are relatively rare. 21    12. Bog   This Broad Habitat type covers wetlands that support vegetation that is usually peat-forming and  which receive mineral nutrients principally from precipitation rather than ground water. This is  referred to as ombrotrophic (rain-fed) mire. The Bog Broad Habitat includes ericaceous, herbaceous  and mossy swards in areas with a peat depth >0.5m.  13. Standing Open Water and Canals  This Broad Habitat type includes natural systems such as lakes, meres and pools, as well as man-made  waters such as reservoirs, canals, ponds and gravel pits.  14. Rivers and Streams   The 'Rivers and Streams' Broad Habitat type covers rivers and streams from bank top to bank top, or  where there are no distinctive banks or banks are never overtopped, it includes the extent of the mean  annual flood.  15. Montane  The ‘Montane Habitats’ category includes a range of vegetation types that occur exclusively in the  montane zone such as prostrate dwarf shrub heath, snow-bed communities, sedge and rush heaths,  and moss heaths. The distinction between the sub-montane and montane zone is often blurred and  the two usually merge through a band of transitional vegetation.  16. Inland Rock  This Broad Habitat type covers both natural and artificial exposed rock surfaces which are >0.25ha,  such as inland cliffs, caves, screes and limestone pavements, as well as various forms of excavations  and waste tips such as quarries and quarry waste.  17. Built-Up Areas and Gardens  This Broad Habitat type covers urban and rural settlements, farm buildings, caravan parks and other  man-made built structures such as industrial estates, retail parks, waste and derelict ground, urban  parkland and urban transport infrastructure. It also includes domestic gardens and allotments. This  type does not include amenity grassland which should be included in the 'Improved Grassland'  category.  18. Supralittoral Rock  This habitat occurs above the high water mark, in areas influenced by wave splash and sea-spray.  Features that may be present include vertical rock, boulders, gullies, ledges and pools, depending on  the wave exposure of the site and its geology.  19. Supralittoral Sediment   This habitat occurs above the high water mark, but in areas influenced by wave splash and sea-spray.  It includes shingle beaches, sand dunes and machair.  20. Littoral Rock  The geology and wave exposure of the shore influence the form of Littoral Rock habitats, which can  be as varied as vertical rock, shore platforms, boulder shores, or rocky reefs surrounded by areas of 22    sediment. In general, Littoral Rock tends to be colonised by algae in wave-sheltered conditions, and  by limpets, barnacles and mussels as wave-exposure increases.  21. Littoral Sediment  Areas of Littoral Sediment are widespread around the UK forming features such as beaches, sand  banks, and intertidal mudflats. A large proportion of this habitat occurs in estuaries and inlets where  it can cover extensive areas. Saltmarsh is included within this Broad Habitat.  22. Inshore Sublittoral Sediment  All areas of sea and estuary class are assumed to be Inshore Sublittoral Sediment.  It is defined as  within six nautical miles of the shoreline by JNCC. 23    Appendix 3: Recommended colour recipe for displaying UKCEH Land Cover Classes    UKCEH Land Cover Class  UKCEH Land Cover  Class number  Red  Green  Blue  Broadleaved woodland  1  255  0  0  Coniferous Woodland  2  0  102  0  Arable and Horticulture  3  115  38  0  Improved Grassland  4  0  255  0  Neutral Grassland  5  127  229  127  Calcareous Grassland  6  112  168  0  Acid grassland  7  153  129  0  Fen, Marsh and Swamp  8  255  255  0  Heather  9  128  26  128  Heather grassland  10  230  140  166  Bog  11  0  128  115  Inland Rock  12  210  210  255  Saltwater  13  0  0  128  Freshwater  14  0  0  255  Supralittoral Rock  15  204  179  0  Supralittoral Sediment  16  204  179  0  Littoral Rock  17  255  255  128  Littoral sediment  18  255  255  128  Saltmarsh  19  128  128  255  Urban  20  0  0  0  Suburban  21  128  128  128    A QGIS symbology file, lcm_raster.qml, which contains the recommended colour recipe for  displaying UKCEH land cover classes as given in Appendix 3 (above), is provided alongside the  respective data product. 24    Appendix 4.

The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2020  Purpose This is the user guide for the new UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2020, LCM2020.  The LCM2020 product consists of six datasets, three for GB and Northern Ireland.  For each, a 10m dataset of classified pixels, a dataset of classified land parcels, and a 25m pixel dataset or rasterised land parcels. Appropriate use of complex data requires a deeper understanding than structure and content.  We therefore describe data production, validation and data accuracy.  Our goal is to help users make informed decisions regarding the application UKCEH LCM data in their current and future work.

Bootstrap Training datasets are used by a Random Forest to classify Classification Scenes. Context Raster: A multi-band raster with contextual information, such as terrain, coastal and urban proximity.  Context Rasters are combined with Seasonal Composite Images to create Classification Scenes. Classification Scene:  A multi-layer raster comprising spectral information from a Seasonal Composite Image and Context Rasters.  Classification Scenes are classified to yield a pixel land cover classification. Seasonal Composite Image: A multi-band raster representing spectral observations across four seasons.  These are designed to provide temporal, phenological information which a classifier can use to differential vegetation types.   UKCEH Land Cover Classes: A set of land cover classes defined by UKCEH, derived from the UK Biodiversity Action Plan Broad Habitats (Jackson et. al. 2000) UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework: A database of land parcel objects derived from generalising national cartography in order to remove unnecessary detail.  All UKCEH LCM Land Parcel datasets use this spatial framework.  Introduction In this document we capitalise the first letters of some specific terminology.  In most cases the meaning of these terms should be clear from the text, but for extra clarity a glossary is provided for these capitalised terms.  Land cover types are also capitalised and/or italicised; these are described in appendices.  LCM2020 is the eighth UK land cover map produced by UK CEH (others include LCM1990, 2000, 2007, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019). Land cover is given as 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes based on Biodiversity Broad Habitats (BAP, see Jackson 2000). LCM2020 was created by classifying Classification Scenes comprising Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Images combined with ten Context Layers designed to reduce spectral confusion.   The classification process is automatic, using a technique we call Bootstrap Training, combined with a Random Forest classifier.   Historically, because of high costs associated with labour intensive image pre-processing and gathering training data, there has been lag of approximately 10 years between UKCEH LCMs.  However, with the new automated techniques we are able to produce new maps annually. Methods are still evolving and we seek continuous improvements.  If new methods yield significant improvements in accuracy we will consider re-application across the entire catalogue.   This will maximise temporal consistency, comparability and the potential for change detection, which is a fundamental goal for our land cover mapping. Errors occur in all land cover products and for earlier UKCEH LCMs we performed significant manual corrections in regions where errors were obvious or prolific.  We no longer do this.  We cannot achieve annual production if we undertake significant manual steps.  However, we take note of problems so that future methods can resolve these.  A benefit of annual production is that it helps us differentiate errors from real-world change.  Most classification errors are random in space and time, so should not occur at exactly the same location year-after-year. With a rich time-series of land cover maps random errors will flicker on and off, whilst real land surface changes will persist.  We therefore anticipate that as the annual series matures, UKCEH annual land cover maps will become an essential tool for monitoring the state and change of the UK countryside and support a wide range of environmental objectives Appendix 4 gives a formal validation of LCM2020.  This indicate that LCM2020 has an overall accuracy of just over 79% at full thematic detail.   UK CEH Land Cover Classes and BAP Broad Habitat Classes At the turn of the century conservation and regulatory agencies had reporting obligations under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP, Jackson et al. 2000) and were co-funding stakeholders of LCM2000 and LCM2007.  Therefore, the 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes are closely related to Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats, but they are not the same.  BAP Broad Habitats were designed for field-based detection by botanists, not remote sensors orbiting the Earth at an altitude of circa 800km, so there are slight deviations.  Agencies no longer have reporting obligations under the UK BAP, but we retain the land cover descriptions to preserve consistency and comparability with earlier products. Describing complex land cover and habitat types that share similar nomenclatures and similar (but not equal) meanings precisely with words can be confusing for the writer, so definitely the readers.  In most cases we could refer to UKCEH Land Cover Classes and BAP Broad Habitats synonymously without causing confusion but we sometimes we need to contrast them.  To reduce ambiguity regarding land cover and habitat descriptions we therefore italicise UK BAP Broad Habitats when explicitly referring to these and at all times when referring to a defined class (UKCEH or UK BAP) we will begin each element with a capital letter. For example:  Improved Grassland refers to the UKCEH Land Cover Class, Improved Grassland the BAP habitat.   Some users do not require the full thematic detail of UKCEH Land Cover Classes so we also provide generalised land cover, UK CEH Aggregate Classes in our Land Parcel product.  Table 1 shows the relationship between UKCEH Land Cover Classes and Aggregate Classes with the UK BAP Broad Habitats.  Usually there is a one-to-one relationship between UK BAP Broad Habitats and derived UKCEH Land Cover Classes.  However, the UK BAP Standing water and Canals and the UK BAP Rivers and Streams are represented by a single UKCEH Land Cover Class, Freshwater.  There is not a UK BAP for saltwater, but we separate saltwater and freshwater when possible, so include a UKCEH LCM Saltwater class.  In two cases, we have found it appropriate to split UK BAP Broad Habitats.  The UK BAP Dwarf Shrub and Heath class is split into UKCEH Land Cover Classes Heather, and Heather Grassland.  The UK BAP Built up Areas and Gardens class is split into UKCEH Land Cover Classes Urban and Suburban.  Fuller details are given in Appendices 1 & 2. Table 1. Relationship between UK CEH Aggregate classes, UK BAP Broad Habitats (Jackson 2000, highlighted in green) and UKCEH Land Cover class and associated integer identifiers.  Additional notes on the on the relationships between UKCEH Land Cover Classes and UK BAP Broad Habitats are given in Appendices 1 and 2 together with satellite-based mapping considerations.  Dataset descriptions LCM2020 includes three geospatial datasets (Table 2) for GB and Northern Ireland, six in total.  Appendix 5 gives the official dataset name for each of these digital holdings.  10m Classified Pixel datasets The 10m pixel datasets result from classified Classification Scenes, compiled to create a single mosaic of national cover.   The Random Forest classifier derives a probability of membership for each class.  The class with the highest is the most likely land cover.  The first band of the 10m pixel dataset is an integer representing the most likely UKCEH Land Cover Class.  The second band is the probability that was associated with this result; this gives an indication of the confidence of the classification (Figure 1). Unlike pixels of the 25m Rasterised Land Parcel dataset the 10m Classified Pixels have not been generalised by combination with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework.  This preserves intricate features of the landscape such as narrow linear features and small patches of habitat that fall below the 0.5 hectare minimum mappable unit (MMU) of the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework.  We anticipate that this extra detail will be of interest and useful but please note the formal validation exercises were  performed against the Land Parcel dataset, not the 10m Classified Pixels.  We therefore recommend these datasets to specialist users who understand the consequence of this statement.  Figure 1.  Left, 10m classified pixels. Right the probability associated with each classified pixel; this is an indicator of classification confidence. Land Parcel datasets The Land Parcel datasets are the result of intersecting the 10m Classified Pixel datasets with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework to generate land parcel attributes (Figure 2, Table 3).  Figure 2.  Classified land parcels and properties of the highlighted (red border) land parcel.  Table 2.  UKCEH LCM product suite details (metadata). Table 3.  UKCEH LCM Land Parcel product attributes for LCM2020. 25m Pixel Rasterised Land Parcel datasets These are the result of rasterising the Land Parcel dataset into 25m pixels, with the pixel origin matching the origin of the British National Grid or the Irish National Grid.  Three attributes are carried from the Land Parcel datasets, giving a 3-band raster.  Band 1 is the dominant land cover _mode; band 2 is _conf; and band 3 _purity (see Figure 3).  Figure 3.  Left top, rasterised land parcels at 25m pixel resolution.  Right-top mean parcel most likely land cover probability (_conf).  Bottom per parcel purity (_purity). Material and Methods Seasonal Composite Images Seasonal Composite Images for classification were derived from Google Earth Engine.  Sentinel-2 surface reflectance values were resampled to 10 pixel resolution and median reflectance was computed for each season: winter (January-March), spring (April-June), summer (July-September), and autumn (October-December) using nine Sentinel-2 bands 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, and 12 (after Carrasco et. al., 2019), see Table 4. There were some seasonal gaps in the Seasonal Composite Images, because of excessive cloud, and these were represented by null data.  Fortunately, this never occurred across all seasons at a single location, so at least some Sentinel-2 satellite data were available for all locations.  Our classification algorithm will tolerate partially complete spectral information, so we were able to produce land cover for the whole of the UK without the need to manually fill gaps.  Table 4  Sentinel-2 spectral bands and spatial resolutions  Context Rasters Spectral confusion can occur between different land cover types that have similar spectral properties.  For example, bare rocks in the littoral coastal zone lack significant vegetation, so too do exposed mountain rocks and sealed urban surfaces.  Spectrally these surfaces can appear very similar when viewed from space and extra detail is needed to differentiate them.  We used 10m Context Rasters to resolve a range of confusion types.  For Great Britain the 10m Context Rasters were: Height, derived from the NEXTMap® terrain product from Intermap® Solutions Aspect, derived from the NEXTMap® terrain product from Intermap® Solutions Slope, derived from the NEXTMap® terrain product from Intermap® Solutions Distance from the nearest building, derived from Ordnance Survey open data Distance from road, derived from Ordnance Survey open data Distance from sea, derived from Ordnance Survey open data Distance from freshwater, derived from Ordnance Survey  open data A foreshore binary mask, derived from Ordnance Survey open data A tidal water binary mask, derived from Ordnance Survey open data A woodland binary mask, derived from Ordnance Survey open data. For Northern Ireland 10m Context Rasters were: Height, derived from the NEXTMap® terrain product from Intermap® Solutions Aspect, derived from the NEXTMap® terrain product from Intermap® Solutions Slope, derived from the NEXTMap® terrain product from Intermap® Solutions An urban binary mask derived from open data of the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency A distance to coast layer derived from the Ordnance Survey or Northern Ireland open data A distance to freshwater layer derived from the Ordnance Survey or Northern Ireland open data A distance to road layer derived from the Ordnance Survey or Northern Ireland open data. Classification Scenes For Great Britain a patchwork of overlapping 100x100km tiles was created (Figure 4).  These were used to select and extract 36-band Seasonal Composite Images from the Google Earth Engine.  These were then combined with the Context Rasters to give a set of 100x100km 46-band GB Classification Scenes.  In total we classified 74 overlapping Classification Scenes whose combined area significantly exceeds the total area of the GB land surface.   Each Classification Scene was trained and classified independently.  Classification Scenes were overlapped to ensure that each had a good range and balance of training observations to maximise classification accuracy.  In regions where overlaps occurred the same region will have been classified multiple times.  Where this occurred there will have been slight variations in results because of different training.  Visual inspection was used to determine precedence of Classification Scenes for the final cut; this is the only manual judgement in the GB UK CEH LCM production process.  The 100x100km tile size was chosen because it provides a manageable size for processing.  Moreover, if regions were much larger phenological variation due to climatic difference across a Classification Scene could begin to degrade results.   For Northern Ireland, because of its much smaller area, it was possible (and much easier) to use a single Classification Scene determined by the minimum bounding rectangle of the Northern Ireland land mass (Figure 2).  The 36-band Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Images were combined with Northern Ireland Context Rasters to produce a 43 band single Classification Scene for each year.  Figure 4.  100x100km tiles used for selecting Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Images for Great Britain (green) and the single tile for Northern Ireland (red). The UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework The UK Land Parcel Spatial Framework used for LCM2020 was originally developed for LCM2007 (Morton et. al., 2011) and a modified version was used for LCM2015.  We have had to make some minor changes since 2015.  The total number of land parcels and their geometries are unchanged, but we have re-ordered database storage and defined new indices to enable faster processing.  The consequence of this is that the unique identifiers (the gid attribute) for each land parcel do not match those provided in the LCM2015 Land Parcel dataset.  For most users this will have no significance, but for users who wish to compare the new land cover with LCM2015 using parcel identifiers, instead of spatial overlap, this will not be immediately possible.  We apologise if this causes inconvenience.   Land parcels in the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework have a minimum area of approximately 0.5 hectares, the minimum mappable unit, MMU.  The land parcels were derived by generalising national cartography (Morton et. al., 2011; Smith et. al., 2007) and are designed to represent discrete real-world units of land such as fields, parks, urban areas, woodlands, lakes and so forth.  It is usual, but not universal, that the land parcels are dominated by a single land cover type.  Organising the 10m Classified Pixels into land parcels helps to reduce classification noise to provide a clean, easier to use product.  It also provides a convenient fixed structure for comparing land cover over time for change detection. Bootstrap Training Bootstrapping is used to refer to a self-starting process that proceeds without external input.  UKCEH have developed a fully automatic training process for land cover/habitat classification that does not require a fresh collection of (expensive) field-gathered data for classifier training, so we have named the process Bootstrap Training.  Land cover and habitat change is usually gradual.  Transitions from one land cover or habitat to another typically occur over a number of years.  Therefore recent habitat/land cover maps can be a valuable source of training data for a new map if the original maps are accurate and the update interval of the new map is short relative to target dynamics. When this is true land cover observations from the historic maps can be used to sample the current satellite image to produce training observations.  These can then be used by a RF classifier to yield a classification result, which contributes to the bootstrap for the next map and so forth.  Because the historic maps give wall-to-wall coverage they provide a very large number of training observations, which is the key to learning success.  Machine-learning algorithms, such as RF, rely on the majority signal to assign class membership, so when the Bootstrap Training set is very large it doesn’t matter if a minor proportion have changed class (are incorrect) over the refresh interval since these will have little influence on the dominant signal. The Bootstrap Training dataset for UKCEH LCM2020 came from UKCEH LCM2017,2018 & 2019.  We filtered these land cover products retaining only land parcels with > 99% purity across all three years.  The resulting training datasets have 941027 training objects for GB and 214833 for Northern Ireland.  Figure 5 gives an example of a Bootstrap Training dataset and resulting classification result.  Figure 5.  UKCEH Land Cover classes (left), a Bootstrap Training set (centre) and the resultant RF land cover classification (right). Random Forest classification Random Forest classification (Breiman 2001) is a supervised learning technique that uses a training set of known observations to derive an empirical relationship that is used to predict the membership of unknown observations.  Bootstrap Training data represent land parcels; these we used to sample all underlying pixels from the Classification Scenes for 2020.  Pixels were placed into labelled bags and from each bag 10,000 samples, with replacement were drawn to train the RF classifier. The RF-classifier subsequently yields the 10m Classified Pixel product (for example, Figure 3, right).  Sampling with replacement ensures that all land cover classes have an equal number of pixel observations for training the Random Forest, this balances learning.  Without balanced learning the signal of rarer classes will be weak and susceptible to domination from commoner classes, causing misclassification.   The classification software used for UKCEH LCMs is bespoke and was developed by UKCEH scientific staff.  It integrates the Weka (Frank et. al. 2016) machine learning suite with a PostGIS geospatial database and gdal tools (https://gdal.org/).  These are all open source technologies. Product validation LCM2020 was validated by comparison with observations derived from the GB countryside survey 2019 and 2020 data, open source National Forest Inventory data, IACS data and a set of bespoke LCM validation points generated from manual image interpretation.  In total, this generated 34715 point locations. These were intersected with UKCEH LCM Land Parcel datasets to determine correspondence.  The overall accuracy of LCM2020 is 79.2 % (Appendix 4).

Notes on UKCEH Land Cover Classes  (see also Appendix 2 for a summary of UK BAP Broad Habitat definitions)  Appendix 2: Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats  This appendix provides a brief summary of the JNCC definitions of the Broad Habitats and is based on Jackson (2000).  There is some duplication of material Appendix 2 with Appendix 1.  However in combination they provide users with key information to understand UKCEH Land Cover Classes and the Broad Habitat definitions they are based on.  Note: class numbers here are JNCC’s Broad Habitat class numbers, not UKCEH Land Cover Class numbers. The text in this Appendix has been copied from Morton et. al., 2011, with very minor updates to remove obsolete cross-references to historical projects and documents, plus some corrections.  Some new comments are included regarding BAP Broad Habitat Linear Features and the new 20m Classified Pixel datasets. 1. Broadleaved, Mixed and Yew Woodland This Broad Habitat is characterised by vegetation dominated by trees >5m high when mature, with tree cover >20%. Scrub (<5 m) requires cover >30% for inclusion in this Broad Habitat.  It includes stands of both native and non-native broadleaved trees and yew. Woodlands dominated by coniferous species but with >20% cover by deciduous species are included in this category.  Areas of fen woodland dominated by species such as willow (Salix spp.), alder (Alnus glutinosa) or birch (Betula spp.) are also included.  2. Coniferous Woodland This Broad Habitat is characterised by vegetation dominated by trees >5m high when mature, which forms a canopy having a cover of >20%. ‘Coniferous Woodland’ includes semi-natural stands and plantations and includes both native and non-native coniferous trees.  3. Boundaries and Linear Features This Broad Habitat type covers a range of linearly arranged landscape features such as hedgerows, lines of trees, walls, stone and earth banks, grass strips and dry ditches. These features are not included as a UKCEH Land Cover Class as they are generally too narrow to be reliably captured from the satellite images. However, linear features are of general interest and an important component of the landscape.  Some linear features will be visible in the 20m Classified Pixel dataset.  In future UKCEH LCMS we are likely to resolve to 10m and more of these features will be visible.  However, regardless of whether or not we can see linears, we cannot classify them using our current methods.  Linear features are in fact just thin fragments of land cover types that we already map.  Membership in this class is defined by shape, not spectra.  We don’t have tools for classifying shapes.  New tools for line-finding within the 20m Classified Pixels products could help with their detection.  Line finding algorithms are well developed and commonly used in other areas of remote sensing, mainly for military applications. 4. Arable and Horticulture This Broad Habitat includes annual crops, perennial crops, woody crops, intensively managed commercial orchards, commercial horticultural land (such as nurseries, commercial vegetable plots and commercial flower growing areas), freshly-ploughed land, annual leys, rotational set-aside and fallow.   5. Improved Grassland ‘Improved Grassland’ is characterised by vegetation dominated by a few fast-growing grasses such as Lolium spp., and also white clover (Trifolium repens), on fertile, neutral soils.  Improved Grasslands are typically either managed as pasture or mown regularly for silage production or in non-agricultural contexts for recreation and amenity purposes. 6. Neutral Grassland This Broad Habitat type is characterised by vegetation dominated by grasses and herbs on a range of neutral soils usually with a pH of between 4.5 and 6.5. It includes enclosed dry hay meadows and pastures, together with a range of grasslands which are periodically inundated with water or permanently moist. 7. Calcareous Grassland Calcareous Grassland is characterised by vegetation dominated by grasses and herbs on shallow, well-drained soils which are rich in bases (principally calcium carbonate) formed by the weathering of chalk and other types of limestone or base-rich rock. Soil pH tends to be high (>6) although it may be as low as 5. 8. Acid Grassland Acid Grassland is characterised by vegetation dominated by grasses and herbs on a range of lime-deficient soils which have been derived from acidic bedrock or from superficial deposits such as sands and gravels. Such soils usually have a low base status, with a pH of <5.5.  9. Bracken  This Broad Habitat type covers areas dominated by a continuous canopy cover of bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) at the height of the growing season. It does not include areas with scattered patches of bracken or areas of bracken which are less than 0.25 ha.  These are included in the Broad Habitat type with which they are associated.  10. Dwarf Shrub Heath ‘Dwarf Shrub Heath’ is characterised by vegetation that has >25% cover of plant species from the heath family (ericoids) or dwarf gorse Ulex minor. It generally occurs on well-drained, nutrient-poor, acid soils.  This habitat type does not include dwarf shrub dominated vegetation in which species characteristic of peat-forming vegetation such as cotton-grass Eriophorum spp. and peat-building sphagna are abundant, or that occurs on deep peat (> 0.5 m) as these are included in the 'Bog' Broad Habitat type.  11. Fen, Marsh and Swamp This habitat includes fen, flushes, springs, fen meadows, rush pasture and swamp. Fens are peatlands which receive water and nutrients from groundwater and surface run-off, as well as from rainfall. Flushes are associated with lateral water movement, and springs with localised upwelling of water. Marsh is a general term usually used to imply waterlogged soil; it is used more specifically here to refer to fen meadows and rush-pasture communities on mineral soils and shallow peats. Swamps are characterised by tall emergent vegetation. Reedbeds (i.e. swamps dominated by stands of common reed Phragmites australis) are also included in this type.  Apart from rush pasture, examples of this Broad Habitat are relatively rare. 12. Bog  This Broad Habitat type covers wetlands that support vegetation that is usually peat-forming and which receive mineral nutrients principally from precipitation rather than ground water. This is referred to as ombrotrophic (rain-fed) mire. The Bog Broad Habitat includes ericaceous, herbaceous and mossy swards in areas with a peat depth >0.5m. 13. Standing Open Water and Canals This Broad Habitat type includes natural systems such as lakes, meres and pools, as well as man-made waters such as reservoirs, canals, ponds and gravel pits. 14. Rivers and Streams  The 'Rivers and Streams' Broad Habitat type covers rivers and streams from bank top to bank top, or where there are no distinctive banks or banks are never overtopped, it includes the extent of the mean annual flood. 15. Montane The ‘Montane Habitats’ category includes a range of vegetation types that occur exclusively in the montane zone such as prostrate dwarf shrub heath, snow-bed communities, sedge and rush heaths, and moss heaths. The distinction between the sub-montane and montane zone is often blurred and the two usually merge through a band of transitional vegetation. 16. Inland Rock This Broad Habitat type covers both natural and artificial exposed rock surfaces which are >0.25ha, such as inland cliffs, caves, screes and limestone pavements, as well as various forms of excavations and waste tips such as quarries and quarry waste. 17. Built-Up Areas and Gardens This Broad Habitat type covers urban and rural settlements, farm buildings, caravan parks and other man-made built structures such as industrial estates, retail parks, waste and derelict ground, urban parkland and urban transport infrastructure. It also includes domestic gardens and allotments. This type does not include amenity grassland which should be included in the 'Improved Grassland' category. 18. Supralittoral Rock This habitat occurs above the high water mark, in areas influenced by wave splash and sea-spray. Features that may be present include vertical rock, boulders, gullies, ledges and pools, depending on the wave exposure of the site and its geology. 19. Supralittoral Sediment  This habitat occurs above the high water mark, but in areas influenced by wave splash and sea-spray. It includes shingle beaches, sand dunes and machair. 20. Littoral Rock The geology and wave exposure of the shore influence the form of Littoral Rock habitats, which can be as varied as vertical rock, shore platforms, boulder shores, or rocky reefs surrounded by areas of sediment. In general, Littoral Rock tends to be colonised by algae in wave-sheltered conditions, and by limpets, barnacles and mussels as wave-exposure increases. 21. Littoral Sediment Areas of Littoral Sediment are widespread around the UK forming features such as beaches, sand banks, and intertidal mudflats. A large proportion of this habitat occurs in estuaries and inlets where it can cover extensive areas. Saltmarsh is included within this Broad Habitat. 22. Inshore Sublittoral Sediment All areas of sea and estuary class are assumed to be Inshore Sublittoral Sediment.  It is defined as within six nautical miles of the shoreline by JNCC.

They account for 45% of the world’s tropical forest, storing about one fifth of the carbon  residing in terrestrial vegetation and annually processing about three times as much carbon  through photosynthesis and respiration as humans release to the atmosphere through fossil  fuel combustion. Amazonia also accounts for a large portion of global land surface  evapotranspiration, and a significant fraction of the world’s known species. Relatively small  changes in the structure and/or function of these forests could therefore have global  consequences for biodiversity, the carbon cycle and the rate of climate change.    RAINFOR (The Amazon Forest Inventory Network, Rede Amazônica de Inventários  Florestais, Red Amazónica de Inventarios Forestales) is an attempt to utilise long-term  permanent sample plots (PSPs) to monitor forest biomass and dynamics, and relate these  observation to soil and climate across the Amazon forest region. Many of these plots were  established in the past to investigate specific local ecological or forest management questions.  However, by compiling and comparing these studies on a regional scale a whole new level of  information becomes available: information that may provide vital insights into the mechanisms  underlying the current responses of Amazonian ecosystems to climate and the possible future  of Amazonia under global change scenarios.    The studies associated with RAINFOR have the following objectives:    1. Quantify long term changes in forest biomass and turnover to date.  2. Relate current forest structure, ecophysiology, biomass and dynamics to local climate and  soil properties.  3. Understand the relationships between productivity, mortality and biomass.  4. Use relationships (i) to (iii) to understand how changes in climate may affect the biomass  and productivity of the Amazon forest as a whole, and inform basin-scale models of carbon  dynamics.  5. Examine variability of tree biodiversity across Amazonia, and its relationship to soils and  climate.    One potential problem with the analysis of data from many different sources is the use of  different methodologies at different sites. In addition, the impact of any changes in the  methodology over time needs to be assessed before apparent temporal changes in dynamics  can be considered robust. An important component of RAINFOR is to encourage discussion of Field Manual for Plot Establishment and Remeasurement       3        methodological issues and the standardisation of forest inventory protocols. To help achieve  this, this manual sets out the procedures for plot establishment and remeasurement that have  been developed over the course of RAINFOR fieldwork in northern Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador  2001/2, and includes some minor refinements since them.    Plot establishment  A. Location  The pan-Amazon strategy within RAINFOR is to maintain sample forest plots across the  edaphic range within each climatic zone and regional plot cluster (Malhi et al. 2002). New plots  should be randomly located within local, geomorphological strata that satisfy certain logistical  criteria. New plots should:      be on reasonably homogenous soil parent material and soil type    have adequate access    have sufficient long term security from human disturbance    have sufficient long term institutional support    exclude areas affected by anthropogenic disturbance, unless understanding direct  human impacts is an explicit or implicit aspect of the local monitoring purpose.     However, in most Amazonian research sites, accurate habitat maps are lacking, which  prohibits complete stratified sampling at large scales. Similarly at local scales, identifying  geomorphological strata is difficult because no accurate soil maps exist. Satellite images can  help in identifying the range of vegetation types that might be found in any one area, but  problems with the scale of resolution and lack of ground-truthing may limit the ability to  accurately predict the exact distribution. Information from local residents and botanists who  know the area can be very useful. Logistical constraints are also important: it is impractical to  locate a plot greater than 1 hour from the field base, and it can be difficult to fit a 1 hectare plot  into a forest that is dissected by tracks.    B. Position  Within strata, plots should be randomly located, to avoid potential ‘majestic forest’ bias. If  maps are available, plot location should be randomly assigned prior to going to the field. If not,  in the field, there may be a tendency to start the plot in particularly ‘good’ forest. If maps are  available, the position of the plot starting point can be randomised by locating it in a random Field Manual for Plot Establishment and Remeasurement       4        direction at a random distance >50m (i.e. well out of sight), of the original, potentially ‘biased’  starting point.    C. Timing  To minimise the errors caused by variation in stem water content between successive  enumerations, plots should be measured over whole year intervals and at the time of year when  there is least interannual variation in soil water availability. For plots in areas that experience  severe interannual variation in rainfall due to El Niño events, the best time of year is during the  wet season.    D. Orientation  N/S and E/W directions for the principal axes of the plot are the most convenient but the  eccentricities of the local strata may prevent this. The bearings of the main axis, and the  latitude, longitude and elevation of the centre of the plot should be recorded. Note if true or  magnetic north is used.    E. Shape  It is important to maintain homogeneity within the plot, so the shape of the  geomorphological strata is an important consideration. Square plots have lower edge:area ratio  than rectangular plots, so have fewer problems with decisions concerning the presence of trees  in or outside the plot at the edges. However, rectangular plots may be less disturbed by cut  lines within the plot, less susceptible to any ‘mature forest’ bias, and the dynamics they record  will be less influenced by single tree fall events. Both shapes are used within the RAINFOR  network.    F. Size   The coefficient of variation of basal area increases as sample plot size decreases below  0.4 ha in Costa Rica (Clark and Clark 2000). 1 ha is a standard size, greater than the scale of  typical tree fall events, but sufficiently small to sample individual soil types. 20 x 20 m is a  convenient subplot size. Field Manual for Plot Establishment and Remeasurement       5        G. Topography  New plots within RAINFOR should be set up to sample one hectare of land surface,  which requires some flexibility with bearings and distances when closing the final side of the  plot. External and internal boundaries of the plot are measured in 20m segments. In some  cases, a planar projection of 1 ha of forest has been used (Dallmeier 1992, Condit 1998) and  slope corrections applied: the distance to be measured parallel to the ground for each segment  is given by:  d = 20/cos  where  is the inclination of slope in degrees. Plots laid out in this way will always tend to  include a greater surface area of land surface, and correction factors allowing comparison  between plots on the basis of land surface area need to be calculated.    H. Visibility  It must be possible to relocate plots, but any permanent markers used must not attract  too much attention! Plastic stakes can be installed in each of the four corners of the plot, driven  well into the ground, with approximately 10 cm showing above the ground. It may be convenient  to also locate stakes every 20m around the plot edges, this is especially important if there is a  serious intention to monitor the plot for long periods to reduce edge-associated measurement  errors in trees recruitment.    I. Stringing the plot  This works well with 4 people: 1 with compass, 1 to cut line, 1 to measure the distance  and 1 to follow behind laying out the string. Stringing the base line of the plot and then carefully  stringing each subplot is the most accurate method of delimiting the plot.    Any cutting should be kept to the absolute minimum - remember, any impacts can affect  growth of trees in the plot and the long term recruitment of new individuals.     J. Tagging trees  Tagging and measuring the trees can be done concurrently by three people. One person  should work out the best order in which the trees should be tagged, and tag them, one  measure, and one take notes and roughly map the plot. Field Manual for Plot Establishment and Remeasurement       6        Trees are included if greater than 50 % of the roots are inside the plot. Trees should be  tagged systematically moving round each subplot with the last tree tagged in each subplot  close the start point of the next subplot.     Knock in the nail at a slight downward angle, just far enough so that it penetrates the bark  and is secure but leaving as much space as possible for the tree to grow without “eating” the  tag. Tag at 1.60m, or exactly 30 cm above the POM, and consistently on the same side of the  trees throughout the subplot. It is helpful to mark a line 30 cm on the hammer so that the  hammer can be used to measure 30 cm above the POM to place the tag. In square, 100 x  100m plots it is useful to tag each successive line of subplots on a different side of the tree, as  this helps identify where the internal lines of the plot are on subsequent occasions. Iron nails  are required for the trees with the hardest external wood (e.g., palms). Note:      Newly broken or deciduous trees can be completely leafless so check carefully: they are  living and should be tagged as long as the cambium beneath the bark is live.      Multiple-stemmed trees are tagged only on the largest stem that is >10cm diameter at  1.30m height. If two stems of the same species are very close together, check the roots  carefully to see if the stems in join below ground.       Fallen trees should be checked carefully to see if they are still alive, as with standing  trees. They should be tagged 1.60m from the tree base.      Tag each liana stem that is >10cm diameter at any point within 2.5m of the ground,  even if <10cm at 1.30m.  CHECK CAREFULLY AS THEY CAN BE EASY TO MISS!  Each climbing liana stem that meets this criterion AND is separately rooted counts as  one individual plant (but check carefully to see that the point where the stem meets the  ground is actually rooted and not simply covered by leaf litter). See detailed section (L)  on liana measurement.    K. Tree measurement  Please note, there are a series of standard codes to record tree condition when alive as  well as mode of death. These standard codes must be used – please see  http://www.rainfor.org/en/manuals/in-the-field, or the end of this document, for details. Field Manual for Plot Establishment and Remeasurement       7        Measure at 1.3 m height wherever possible. Note: IF 1.3 m IS NOT USED AS THE  POINT OF MEASUREMENT (“POM”) IN ORDER TO AVOID DEFORMITIES OR BUTTRESS  ROOTS, RECORD THE HEIGHT OF THE POM. Use a pole with 1.3 m marked, pushed firmly  into the leaf litter to the mineral soil next to the tree, to define POM (Swaine, et al. 1987, Condit  1998). Note that breast height is not the vertical height above the ground, but should be  measured as the straight line distance along the trunk, even if it is leaning or bent.  In plots  where the trees are tagged at 1.6m height, the POM is 30cm below the tag unless noted  otherwise.    The exact measurement point should be marked with chalk (white or yellow) by the  measurer, and the location then painted with emulsion paint (yellow or red).       Climbers: The tape is passed under any vines or roots on the stem and then is moved  back and forth to clean the POM of loose bark and debris. Hemiepiphytes, or lianas that  closely hug the stem should be lifted not cut. In rare cases where lianas or stranglers are  firmly attached to the tree stem, the diameter can be estimated by holding the tape  perpendicular to the stem at the POM, or using an optical method (see below).      Buttresses: If the tree is buttressed at 1.3 m, measure stem 50 cm above the top of the  buttress (Condit 1998). Record height of POM.                   Deformities: If the tree has a major stem deformity at 1.3 m height, then measure 2 cm  below the deformity (Condit 1998). Record POM height.      Fluted trees: Trees that are fluted for their entire length should be measured at 1.3 m.       Slopes and fallen or leaning trees: Breast height is always calculated on the downhill  side of the tree, and trees that are fallen or leaning are always measured at 1.3m length  along the side of the stem closest to the ground. This procedure avoids confusion with  the common situation when trees are both on slopes and leaning – trees usually lean  downhill and these rules mean there is no confusion regarding the side of the tree used  1.3 m   POM  50 cm Field Manual for Plot Establishment and Remeasurement       8        to measure the POM. On fallen trees it is difficult to define the base of the trunk  accurately – therefore measure the tree 30 cm below the tag.                  Stilt-rooted trees: Stilt rooted individuals should be measured 50 cm above the highest  stilt root and the POM recorded.      Resprouts: On standing, but broken trees, or fallen individuals, the main stem and  resprouts are measured at 1.3 m from the base of the stem. A resprouting individual is  only included if the resprouts are greater than 1.3 m from the stem base.      Multiple stems: All stems greater than 10 cm at 1.3 m are measured, painted, and  recorded.      Large buttress trees: Large buttress trees should be left by the measurement team  and done separately later: it typically takes two people one day to measure the large  trees in a plot. A ladder is essential to reach the POM of some large trees, and in some  cases two ladders may be needed to ensure accurate measurement.  If the POM cannot  be reached, then diameter should be measured by a climber with a diameter tape; or, if  impossible by a climber, then as a last option by digital camera. Measurement by  relaskop is not recommended.     For digital camera measurements:    In rare cases when the POM cannot be reached either by ladder or by a climber, a digital  camera provides a reasonably accurate method for measuring the diameter of large trees. A  photo is taken of a ruler or tape aligned at the POM. From each photo, the diameter can be  measured in pixels, and the number of pixels per cm calculated. This method works best if a  laptop computer is also available every evening to download the digital data and calculate  diameter. This allows for a return visit to the tree the next day in case any uncertainties remain.       POM  height  POM  height Field Manual for Plot Establishment and Remeasurement       9          Record:    height of POM    height of camera    compass bearing from camera to tree    horizontal distance from camera to the centre of the tree    length of the reference scale    photo number    diameter estimate, as a check    Error is minimised by: 1) photographing a ruler or tape as long as the tree diameter. An  old tape can be cut and attached to a palm frond or very straight branch or stretched between  two poles; 2) keeping the angle from the camera to the POM is as shallow as possible. To  achieve this, if a tripod is available, the camera can be placed at a greater distance and the  photo taken with zoom (minimum 5 m, recommended 10+m). 3) Digital camera measurements  should be made at the same POM from a minimum of two different, perpendicular points due to  asymmetric stems.     The maximum zoom possible should be used to ensure the reference scale can be read.  Using a high ISO (e.g. >800) allows the photos to be taken without a tripod. The POM should  be painted and can painted by attaching a paintbrush horizontally to a long pole.    A correction should be applied for this optical method as it fractionally underestimate  diameter (see Correction for Optical, below).     L. Liana measurement  Lianas present special measurement challenges for long-term plot studies.  We have  developed a range of protocols to maximise long-term comparability across sites and through  time at individual sites.    Selecting the point of measurement (POM) for lianas is particularly tricky, and has not  been well standardised making comparisons among different research groups difficult.  Our  protocol calls for each liana stem to be measured at three different points, to maximise  comparability within the site for time-dependent analyses (growth, recruitment, mortality),  across the whole RAINFOR dataset, and with other studies worldwide. Field Manual for Plot Establishment and Remeasurement       10        We include any liana or hemi-epiphyte that reaches 10cm diameter at any point along  the stem between 0 and 2.5m above the ground. 0 is defined as the last rooting point.     For lianas and hemiepiphytes, record the diameter measurements at three points:     1. at 130cm along the stem from the principal rooting point (=”d1.3length”),   2. at 130cm vertically above the ground (i.e., 30cm below the nail in plots where plants are  tagged at 1.6m), (=”d1.3height”)  3. and ALSO at the widest point on the stem within 2.5m of the ground (= “dmax”),  including any deformity.      Check carefully for the maximum diameter point – in lianas it is often close to the ground  or a branching node where anomalous growth can be most marked. Describe the maximum  diameter measurement point precisely in notes (e.g., ‘by ground’, ‘10cm above tag’ etc.).    Paint all POMs carefully with emulsion paint, just as with trees. Tags should be at a point  measured 30 cm above the POM (130 cm vertically above the ground).  Some lianas are ‘cabled’ (e.g., some Malpighiaceae) with the cables progressively  splitting as the liana ages and each cable thickens; in these cases it is difficult to measure the  liana in a way to permit long-term estimation of radial growth increments.  For these lianas,  diameter is estimated by tightening the diameter tape around all adjacent cables originating  from the same root base.  Other lianas are clearly elliptic in cross-section (reaching extremes in  some ‘monkey-ladder’ Bauhinia spp); these stems should be measured in two ways:  conventionally (i.e. wrap the tape round the whole stem) and by twice measuring the linear  distance of each of the maximum and minimum dimension and taking the geometric mean.   Following these conventions, every liana that attains >10.0cm dmax should be tagged and  measured.      Further difficulties can be presented by deciding where one liana ends and another starts.   Thus, lianas are sometimes connected to one another below ground but this can be hard to  establish.  Therefore, for ease of application we apply the criterion that any climbing stem that  fully enters the mineral soil counts as an independent plant (= an “apparent genet”).  If unsure,  then tag the stem and comment that it may be the same as another stem.  In cases where the  liana plant branches, each branch that branches within 2.50m vertical distance from the ground  and attains >10.0cm dmax is measured (as with all trees that branch at <1.30m).  In practice it  is extremely rare for a branching liana to have two or more branches >10cm diameter (on  average in Amazonia this occurs at a frequency of <0.1 per ha). Field Manual for Plot Establishment and Remeasurement       11        For each liana stem (or ascending branch if there are more than one), note the number  of the tree in which tree(s) the liana crown is in and record the tree number whose crown is  most heavily affected by the liana. The purpose of this is to generate simple and comparable  estimates of liana/tree interactions (e.g., estimate the extent to which liana infestation may  enhance the probability of tree death).  If the host tree is outside the plot it will not have a  number: in these cases the tree diameter should be measured directly (tape) or visually  (Relaskop or digital camera method).    M. Data recording  In summary, the following details should be recorded:    Trees:   subplot number   estimated X and Y co-ordinates from bottom left-hand corner of plot (can be measured  precisely using laser rangefinder)   Tag   Family and species name   Diameter in mm   POM, if different from 1.3 m   ladder, or Relaskop/digital camera if used.   bole form (see Appendix 1 for codes).    Measurements of multiply measured buttressed trees should be put in the same row of  the data table for ease of converting to stem BA values and individual stem records for mortality  rates etc. Measurements of multiple stemmed trees go in separate rows. Relaskop/digital  camera measurements go on separate sheet, coded on original fieldsheets.  Additional measurements of liana canopy infestation of trees and of canopy crown  illumination  are  also  recommended.  Protocols  for  these  are  available  at  http://www.rainfor.org/en/manuals/in-the-field, and at the end of this document.    Lianas:   subplot number   estimated X and Y co-ordinates from bottom left-hand corner of plot (can be measured   precisely using laser rangefinder)   Tag    Family and species name Field Manual for Plot Establishment and Remeasurement       12          Diameter  (mm) at 1.3 m along the stem    Diameter (mm)  at 1.3 m vertical height    Max. diameter at any point below 2.5 m     Tree(s) that liana canopy is in    Tree most heavily affected by the liana canopy    Sub-plot    Sketch map of tree locations    Slopes of subplot boundaries    Soil texture and drainage    Plot    Latitude and Longitude     Elevation    Bearings of plot boundaries    Local landmarks to assist plot relocation   Rooting depth: For fallen trees – evaluate depth of rooting mat, depth of deepest root;  record if it has a taproot, and the taproot diameter. Record species and dbh of the  downed tree, and topographical position.    N. Tree bole length and total tree height  In addition, tree heights should be measured, to establish plot level diameter/height  relationships for accurate modelling of tree-by-tree volumes for each plot, and test whether tree  shape differs between stands in different environmental conditions. The aim is to characterise  the ‘ideal’ height/diameter curve as determined by climatic and edaphic conditions and not  confused by the influence of damaged trees. Ideally, every tree in the plot should have its  height measured. In practice this may not be possible due to time restrictions. If this is the case  the following procedure is recommended:    Excluding trees coded as leaning, rotten, broken, forked below 5m, fallen or resprouted,  randomly select from the plot fieldsheets:       10 individuals, 10-20 cm dbh    10 individuals, 20-30 cm dbh    10 individuals, 30-50 cm dbh Field Manual for Plot Establishment and Remeasurement       13          10 individuals greater than 50 cm dbh.    Measurements should be made by laser hypsometer ideally, if not available then manual  trigonometric methods are acceptable.  Record the method used.    From a suitable viewpoint, (angles of approx. 45o to the first branch are ideal as they  minimise the error from any inaccuracy in measuring the angle):       the angle to the base of the first main branch (a). A main branch is defined as one  greater than 5 cm diameter, with leaves.    the horizontal distance from this point to the centre of the tree (x)    the angle to the base of the stem (b).    Bole height = x (tan(a) + tan (b)).  For measurement of total tree height, ‘(a)’ should be substituted by the angle to the top of  the crown.     If in the field, a tree is found to be unsuitable (impossible to get a suitable viewpoint, for  example), then the nearest stem in the correct size class should be used.    O. Wood density measurements  A rapid approach to assessing stand-level wood density has also been developed. This  variable is necessary to achieve greater accuracy in measurements of biomass than those  based solely on plot basal area, and can also be used as a functional measure of forest species  composition. Measurements of branch wood density in the field provide information on (usually  non-timber) species that have not previously been studied.     From branches cut down from the crown for botanical collection or leaf nutrient analysis  collect 10 cm long samples of at least 1.5 cm diameter and store the sample in plastic bags. In  the evening measure the maximum and minimum diameter of each end of the sample  measured to 0.1 mm using calipers. When measurements are not possible directly after  sampling, ‘fresh’ volume is measured following rehydration of the samples in water overnight.  Dry these samples in air in the field (fungus will grow if they are kept in plastic bags). Dry the  samples overnight in a herbarium drier. Density is calculated as dry weight over fresh volume.  Record sample mass to 0.01 g. Field Manual for Plot Establishment and Remeasurement       14        P. Botanical collection  To enable among-site and longitudinal within-site comparisons of floristic pattern and  change requires planning, investment, and long-term involvement of botanists: botanical  collection, identification, and specimen curation are specialised and time-consuming processes.   For new plots, all morphospecies that cannot be identified to species in the field with 100%  confidence need to be collected. Samples need to be pressed and transported to the relevant  herbarium for subsequent identification. Duplicate stems of morphospecies should be identified  in the field to avoid unnecessary collections being made: a single collection of each  morphospecies per plot is sufficient, if other stems can be matched with 100% confidence to  that morphospecies in the field. The initials of the collector (3 initials) and collection number  should be recorded (e.g. AMM17893) in the row of the tree that was collected. Other stems that  have been identified in the field as the same morphospecies or species as other trees which  have been collected should be related to the reference voucher by placing the collection  number of the reference voucher in the row for that tree, with an ‘=’ sign (i.e. =AMM17893).     Q. Suggested timing and personnel for a 1-ha new plot  Locating and stringing a plot: 3-4 people, 2 days  Tree tagging, painting, mapping and measurement: 4 people, 3 days   Large trees and tree heights: 2 people, 1 ½  days  Topography: 2 people, ½ day  Botanical collection: 2-3 people, 10 days [assuming median Amazon alpha-diversity, 150  species per ha]  Total ~48 person-day    Additional time may need to be allocated for significant rain delays, breaks for field-team  rest and recreation, and unforeseen circumstances.  Botanical collection-times are very  variable, being sensitive to the difficulty (number of species), weather conditions, and the  physical skills and technical knowledge of the team. Field Manual for Plot Establishment and Remeasurement       15        Plot remeasurement    A. Stringing  For relocating a previously established plot, run string along all the outer edges of the  plot, using the bearings and the location of previously tagged trees to help define the plot edge  and, where available, any edge stakes. This is quite straightforward where the understorey is  clear and most trees still have their tags, but is time-consuming where many trees have lost  their tags and/or the plot edge crosses a tree-fall.  Using a previous hand-drawn map of the  trees, if available, can help. Recorded compass bearings for plot edges are obviously helpful  too but beware: small deviations in a bearing can result in incorrect exclusion or inclusion of  large numbers of trees growing close to the plot edges. If you do follow a bearing, always check  that the string is not excluding any previously tagged trees or including any large trees that  obviously have never been tagged. Run string along each subplot edge, to follow the old  number sequences.    B. Tree and liana measurement  One person takes notes, using waterproof paper pre-printed with plot tree information.  The note-taker should use any existing map of tree positions, if one is available. Hand-drawn  maps are not precise but should be good enough to work out where trees should be - and  therefore where to search for them if the measurement team does not locate them.     The same measurement protocols should be used as above. When remeasuring trees, if  the top of buttress has grown within 30 cm of the marked POM, in addition to measuring at  original POM, measure diameter 50 cm above first POM. Discard low POMs as buttress  extends over them with time. This procedure ensures that there is always a consistent, non- buttressed measurement of diameter growth. Field Manual for Plot Establishment and Remeasurement       16        C. Dealing with buttressed trees  Buttresses and other deformities require careful siting of points of measurement (POMs), and owing to tree growth these POMs may need to  be changed. We have developed field approaches aiming to help obtain unbiased, above-buttress, estimates of plot basal area and growth. The  approach used depends on whether previous measurements were ‘good’ or ‘bad’. The field team must make a clear decision and record this  on the field sheets. If the top of buttress has grown within 30 cm of the marked POM, in addition to measuring at original POM, measure  diameter 50 cm above first POM. Discard low POMs to ensure there is always a consistent, non-buttressed measurement of diameter growth.    Field POM Change Guide    Type of POM Change  Previous measurement  Current measurement   Field protocol  D1  D2  Field Sheet Comments  Non-buttress POM Change:  ‘Good’: above buttress &  POM recorded  affected by irregular stem  form, damage to trunk, etc  two measures: i) at original POM (D2  written in comments); ii) above  deformity (1); paint new POM  D@POM above  damage/deformity  D@  original  POM  write "previously D@POM  (irregular stem, damaged  stem, etc.)"  Buttress POM Change 1:   ‘Good’: above buttress &  POM recorded  current measure  ‘Good’，but close to  buttress (< 50 cm)  two measures: i) at original POM (D2);  ii) above buttress at new POM (D1)  D@POM above  buttress  D@  original  POM  write "previously D@POM  (above buttress) “  Buttress POM change 2:  ‘Good’: above buttress &  POM recorded  POM affected by buttress    one measure: above buttress (D1);  paint new POM  D@POM above  buttress  Estimated  post-field  write "previous POM affected  by buttress"  Buttress POM change 3:  ‘Poor’: around buttress, or  diameter estimated at  known POM  POM affected by  buttress  one measure: above buttress (D1);  paint new POM  D@POM above  buttress  Estimated  post-field  write "previous POM affected  by buttress"  Unknown POM change:   POM not recorded or  diameter estimated  OK  one measure: above buttress; paint  new POM  D@POM above  buttress    =D1  write "unknown POM" and/or  "DBH previously estimated"  Note:  Field sheet notation system:  (O) circle measurements to check  (√/OK) tick/OK to indicate previous or current measurement OK  (X) Cross out measurement to indicate unreliable previous measurement  (?) Questionable previous measurement    Further suggestions and analyses on how to deal with the difficult issue of deriving accurate long-term growth estimates from trees whose POM is  changed are discussed in recent literature (e.g., Talbot et al. 2014) Field Manual for Plot Establishment and Remeasurement       17          D. Mortality and recruitment  For dead trees, the mode of death should be recorded – fallen, broken, standing (i.e. with  branches intact).    There are a special set of RAINFOR codes for tree status (alive + dead). See Appendix 1.     When recensusing, two people should do the tree measurements and carry nails, tags,  and a hammer, and tag new recruits as they are found. Give them the number of the nearest  tagged tree and add A, B etc, to keep the spatial pattern. Mark unidentified new trees (recruits)  clearly with bright pink or orange tape for later collecting.    E. Dealing with errors  Think about the measures as you record them: The plot data sheets provide a lot of  information about individual trees, i.e. size, taxon, and previous ‘traumas’ (e.g., ‘live, broken’)  which may explain its disappearance since.  The historical measurement progression gives the  note-taker further insights which can be very useful (e.g. it helps to flag immediately if the new  measurement may be error – can unusually large or negative changes in diameter be explained  by recent changes to the trees’ local environment or condition?).  In the field, if the measure  called out shows an increase above the long-term trend, or a decrease, the note-taker should  ask the measurer to remeasure immediately to check. The person taking notes should check  carefully that no trees have been missed, particularly fallen trees. When recensusing try to  follow spatial sequence of old numbers if possible: it makes it easier to work out the old  numbers of trees who have lost their tags.    F. Suggested timing and personnel requirements  Recensusing 1-ha plot  Locating and stringing the plot: 3 people, 0.5 day  Tree tagging, painting and measurement: 4 people, 2 days  Large trees: 2 people, 1 day  Botanical collection of new recruits: 1-2 people, 1 day (less in low diversity forests)  Total ~13 person-day Field Manual for Plot Establishment and Remeasurement       18        Additional time may need to be allocated for significant rain delays, breaks for field-team  rest and recreation, and unforeseen circumstances.  Botanical collection-times are very  variable, being sensitive to the difficulty (number of species), weather conditions, and the  physical skills and technical knowledge of the team.    G. Data processing  Data collected during the RAINFOR field campaigns is uploaded to ForestPlots.net  (www.forestplots.net). Please follow the protocol described in the “Post-field data handling”  section of the ForestPlots.net manual to prepare your data for upload.  After the data has been uploaded, follow the quality control protocol. The quality control  protocol includes information on how to deal with data processing problems like “unlikely  recruits” (large trees that “appear” in the plot”), missing census information of trees and  “abnormal growth”.  In all cases, a record should be kept of the original measurement, the presumed error,  and the correction made. The ForestPlots.net database includes functionality for recording all  such data manipulations (see ForestPlots.net manual).    Plot data organisation, one Excel file per plot    Worksheets  3 worksheets per file, giving tree, liana and site details    Columns  Tree and liana sheets contain information on plot and stem number, taxonomy,  all diameter measurements, and point of measurement (POM). Where two  diameter measurements were made on a single stem, due to buttress growth  above original POM, this data is included in separate columns (dbh 02 (2) and  POM (2)). Field notes column includes observations useful in the field (leaning,  fluted etc); data notes column includes details of any manipulation of the data for  that stem (missing data interpolated etc)    Rows  One row per stem. Each stem of multiple stemmed individuals occupies one row. Field Manual for Plot Establishment and Remeasurement       19        H. Correction for optical digital camera measurements of tree diameter  Optical measurements of tree diameter underestimate true diameter:                        where x = true radius, r = measured radius and y = distance from point of observation to  point of measurement of tree (= a / cosα, where a is the horizontal distance to centre of tree,  and α = angle of elevation from observation point, to point of measurement on the tree).  Assuming the cross-section of the trunk is circular along the line of sight, the true radius is  given by:    x = (0.5 * (y2 – (y4 –  4r2y2)1/2))1/2    Typically, the error is approximately 0.5 % of the measured diameter. It increases with  tree size and decreases with larger distances between the tree and the point of observation.                                  x  y  r  Point of  observation Field Manual for Plot Establishment and Remeasurement       20          References     Clark, D.B. and Clark, D.A., 2000.

Write in the comments  column at what height the stem is broken.  c=  Alive, leaning by ≥10%. The leaning code cannot be used with the fallen code 'd'.  d=  Alive, fallen (e.g. on ground).  e=  Cabled.   f=  Alive, hollow.  g=  Alive, rotten.  h=  Multiple stemmed individual, i.e. two or more stems >99mm at maximum diameter, branching  below 1.3m height. Each stem >99mm gets a number. Should be used with other code - e.g. if a  liana is leaning and with multiple stems use 'ch'.  i=  Alive, no leaves, few leaves  j=  Alive, burnt  k=  Alive, snapped < 1.3m (therefore the diameter at 1.3m is 0mm).  l=  Alive, itself has liana ≥10cm diameter on stem or in canopy.  m=  Itself covered by lianas.  Use where canopy is at least 50% covered by lianas, even if no individual  liana reaches 10cm diameter.  n=  New recruit. Always use with another code- e.g. if liana is normal and new then use the code 'an',  if liana is broken and a new recruit the code is 'bn'.  o=  Lightning damage  p=  Cut  q=  Peeling bark (bark loose/flaking)  s=  Has a strangler.  u=  Elliptical.  z=  Alive, declining productivity (nearing death)    Note: Liana Alive Status Codes can be used together in any combination.  The only exceptions are codes  'a', 'c' and 'd'. Please read the notes when using these codes!

For example a dead liana that is fallen, died alone and was killed by branches from a  living host tree would be 'cpy'.    For multiple deaths the numbers of lianas that died should be recorded and written in the comments column.    For broken liana the height at which the breakage occurred should be recorded in the comments column.

Dataset name: Physical and chemical properties of wildfire ash collected from different ecosystems and burn severities across the globe, 2003-2021  Data files ash_chemical_properties.csv ash_physical_properties.csv   Analytical Methods for Chemical Characteristics of Wildfire Ash  Methods description: Digestion for Total Analysis: According to  EPA 3051 (alternative)  0,25 g ash sample + 8 ml Nitric Acid + 1 ml Chloridric Acid  200 ºC during 45 min in a Microwave Ethos Easy Milestone Cool off and make it to 50 ml with D.I. water to 50 ml.  Leachate Experiments: According to  Leachate Geochemical Results for Ash and Burned Soil Samples from the October 2007 Southern California Wildfires Weight 4.0 grams of sample (ash or burned soil) into 100 mL wide-mouth plastic bottles. Then, add 80 mL (D.I.) water, slowly.  Shake for 5 minutes using a mechanical shaker. After shaking, stand for 10 minutes. After stand, measure pH and specific conductance. Then, filter using a 0.45µm pore-size nitrocellulose filter. Acidify a sub-sample until pH <1.5 with ultra-pure nitric acid for AA analysis. (Ca, Mg, Na, Al, Fe, Mn). Store another sub-sample in the fridge for the other analysis. (F-, NH4+, UV index, DOC, P & PO4, Cl-, NO3=, SO4=).  Determination of Carbonates: We used a Bernard Calcimeter following ISO 10693:1995. First, we make a calibration curve with different weights using CaCO3 as standard. Then, we use a sample with known weight, annotate the CO2 volume displaced at the calcimeter and replace it in the calibration curve.  UV index: UV transmittance refers to the percentage of light at a wavelength of 254 nm that passes through a sample of water. UVT is related to organic, colloidal residues and suspended particles. Measure using 254 nm wavelength. Put the sample directly in to equipment and annotate value. Results expressed in %T. Less % correspond to high particles quantity.  DOC: Based in Hue & Liu 1995. 2 ml of sample (and standards) in glass tubes. Add 3 ml of digester solution (K2Cr2O7 0,2 N in H2SO4 26,7 N). Cover and put in an oven at 140-150º for 30 minutes. Cool and read at 590 nm.  P & PO4: Acid ascorbic method was used.  Prepare mixed reagent containing sulfuric acid, ammonium molybdate and potassium tartrate. Store solution in a dark glass bottle at 4 °C. Ascorbic acid in water was used as the reducing solution. Take 5 ml sample and standards (L.T. or T.A. digestion). Add the mix reagent and reducing solution. Make a calibration curve and measure samples to 880 nm.     Analytical Methods for Physical Characteristics of Wildfire Ash Bulk density Bulk density (BD) was measured on an oven-dried (105 oC) weight basis of a core sample of known volume (Blake and Hartge, 1986a). Water retention capacity Water retention at field capacity (FC: 33 kPa) and permanent wilting point (WP: 1500 kPa) were determined by Richard's pressure plates method (Klute, 1986). Particle density Particle density was measured using a pycnometer and deionized water (Blake and Hartge, 1986b) at different time steps (0 h, 1 h, 4 h, 7 h, 24 h, 7 days, 14 days, and 21 days) to assess particle density change with time. Water drop penetration time (WDPT) Water repellency was determined using the Water Drop Penetration Time (WDPT) test (Doerr, 1998). The test consists of placing 5 water drops on the sample surface and measuring the average time taken to infiltrate completely.   References  Blake, G.R., Hartge, K.H., 1986a. Bulk density.

ss_multi_readme.png – an example of output summary statistics File contents  Model code  The environments to run the code can be found in the 'environments' folder. ```tfenv_2.13_requirements.txt``` is used for deep learning related processes such as ```pg_gan.py``` and ```demographic_selection_oop.py```. ```pg-gan_env.yml``` is used for creating summary statistics plots, ABC rejection analysis and other utility functions.  Further information on how to run the code can be found in the markdown file README.md Model development and usage Model  The model implements a GAN-based algorithm (Generative Adversarial Network) described in a previous paper (https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.13386 ) which states “we present a parametric GAN framework that combines the ability to create realistic data with the interpretability that comes from an explicit model of evolution. The discriminator is a permutation-invariant CNN that takes as input a genotype matrix (representing a genomic region) and classifies it as real data or synthetic data. Throughout training, the discriminator tries to get better at this binary classification task. The generator is a coalescent simulator that generates genotype data from a parameterized demographic history. The generator is trained using a simulated annealing algorithm that proposes parameter updates leading to more discriminator confusion. The discriminator is trained using a gradient descent approach that is standard for neural networks." The network is trained via simulations using msprime and by VCF files converted to h5 format. Scripts are provided to change formats to the appropriate ones. The environment on a terminal can be activated as: source ~/${PATH}/tfenv_2.13/bin/activate Output files include text files and plots for estimates of parameters of interest.

1    The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2022      Version  Date  Updates  1.0  16/05/2024  First version 2    Purpose  This is the user guide for the new UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2022, LCM2022. The LCM2022 product  consists of seven datasets, three each for Great Britain and Northern Ireland comprising a 10 m  dataset of classified pixels, a dataset of classified land parcels, and a 25 m pixel dataset or rasterised  land parcels. A further 1 km summary raster product covering both Great Britain and Northern Ireland  is also available. Appropriate use of complex data requires a deeper understanding than structure and  content. We therefore describe data production, validation and data accuracy. Our goal is to help  users make informed decisions regarding the application UKCEH LCM data in their current and future  work.

Bootstrap Training datasets are used by a Random Forest to classify Classification Scenes.  Context Raster: A multi-band raster with contextual information, such as terrain, coastal and urban  proximity. Context Rasters are combined with Seasonal Composite Images to create Classification  Scenes.  Classification Scene: A multi-layer raster comprising spectral information from a Seasonal Composite  Image and Context Rasters. Classification Scenes are classified to yield a pixel land cover classification.  Seasonal Composite Image: A multi-band raster representing spectral observations across four  seasons. These are designed to provide temporal, phenological information that a classifier can use to  differentiate vegetation types.    UKCEH Land Cover Classes: A set of land cover classes defined by UKCEH, derived from the UK  Biodiversity Action Plan Broad Habitats (Jackson et. al. 2000).  UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework: A database of land parcel objects derived from generalising  national cartography in order to remove unnecessary detail. All UKCEH LCM Land Parcel datasets use  this spatial framework. 4    Introduction  In this document we capitalise the first letters of some specific terminology. In most cases the meaning  of these terms should be clear from the text, but for extra clarity a glossary is provided for these  capitalised terms. Land cover types are also capitalised and/or italicised; these are described in  appendices.   LCM2022 is the tenth UK land cover map produced by UKCEH (others include LCM1990, 2000, 2007,  2015, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021). Land cover is given as 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes based on  Biodiversity Broad Habitats (BAP, see Jackson 2000). LCM2022 was created by classifying Classification  Scenes comprising Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Images combined with a series of Context Layers  designed to reduce spectral confusion. The classification process is automatic, using a technique we  call Bootstrap Training, combined with a Random Forest classifier.    Historically, because of high costs associated with labour intensive image pre-processing and  gathering training data, there has been lag of approximately ten years between UKCEH LCMs.   However, using new automated techniques we are able to produce new land cover maps annually.  These methods are still evolving and we seek continuous improvements. If new methods yield  significant improvements in accuracy, we will consider re-application across the entire catalogue. This  will maximise temporal consistency, comparability and the potential for change detection, which is a  fundamental goal for our land cover mapping. A benefit of annual production is that it helps to  differentiate errors from real-world change. Most classification errors are random in space and time,  so should not occur at exactly the same location year-after-year. With a rich time-series of land cover  maps random errors will flicker on and off, whilst real land surface changes will persist. We therefore  anticipate that as the annual series matures, UKCEH annual land cover maps will become an essential  tool for monitoring the state and change of the UK countryside and support a wide range of  environmental objectives Formal validation of LCM2022 gives an overall accuracy of 86.1%, at full  thematic detail.    UK CEH Land Cover Classes and BAP Broad Habitat Classes  At the turn of the century, conservation and regulatory agencies had reporting obligations under the  UK Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP, Jackson et al. 2000) and were co-funding stakeholders of LCM2000  and LCM2007. Therefore, the 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes are closely related to Biodiversity Action  Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats, but they are not identical. BAP Broad Habitats were designed for field- based detection by botanists rather than via satellite remote sensing, therefore there are slight  deviations. Agencies no longer have reporting obligations under the UK BAP, but we retain the land  cover descriptions to preserve consistency and comparability with earlier products.  Describing complex land cover and habitat types that share similar nomenclatures and similar (but not  equal) meanings precisely with words can ambiguous. In most cases we could refer to UKCEH Land  Cover Classes and BAP Broad Habitats synonymously without causing confusion, however we  sometimes we need to contrast them. To reduce ambiguity regarding land cover and habitat  descriptions, we therefore italicise UK BAP Broad Habitats when explicitly referring to these. At all  times when referring to a defined class (UKCEH or UK BAP) we will begin each element with a capital  letter. For example:  Improved Grassland refers to the UKCEH Land Cover Class, Improved Grassland  the BAP habitat.    Some users do not require the full thematic detail of UKCEH Land Cover Classes so we also provide  generalised land cover UKCEH Aggregate Classes in our Land Parcel product. Table 1 shows the  relationship between UKCEH Land Cover Classes and Aggregate Classes, with the UK BAP Broad 5    Habitats. Usually there is a one-to-one relationship between UK BAP Broad Habitats and derived  UKCEH Land Cover Classes. However, the UK BAP Standing water and Canals and the UK BAP Rivers  and Streams are represented by a single UKCEH Land Cover Class, Freshwater. There is not a UK BAP  for saltwater, but we separate saltwater and freshwater when possible, so include a UKCEH LCM  Saltwater class. In two cases, we have found it appropriate to split UK BAP Broad Habitats. The UK BAP  Dwarf Shrub and Heath class is split into UKCEH Land Cover Classes Heather and Heather grassland.  The UK BAP Built up Areas and Gardens class is split into UKCEH Land Cover Classes Urban and  Suburban. Fuller details are given in Appendices 1 & 2.  Table 1. Relationship between UK CEH Aggregate classes, UK BAP Broad Habitats (Jackson 2000,  highlighted in green) and UKCEH Land Cover class and associated integer identifiers. Additional notes  on the on the relationships between UKCEH Land Cover Classes and UK BAP Broad Habitats are given  in Appendices 1 and 2 together with satellite-based mapping considerations.

Appendix 3 gives the official dataset name for each of these digital holdings.   10 m Classified Pixel datasets  The 10 m pixel datasets are produced from multiple classified Classification Scenes that are compiled  to create a single mosaic of national cover. The Random Forest classifier derives a probability of  membership for each class. The class with the highest is the most likely land cover. The first band of  the 10 m pixel dataset is an integer representing the most likely UKCEH Land Cover Class. The second  band is the probability that was associated with this result; this gives an indication of the confidence  of the classification (Figure 1).  Unlike pixels of the 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel dataset, the 10 m Classified Pixels have not been  generalised by combination with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework. This preserves intricate  features of the landscape such as narrow linear features and small patches of habitat that fall below  the 0.5 hectare minimum mappable unit (MMU) of the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework. We  anticipate that this extra detail will be of interest and useful but please note the formal validation  exercises were performed against the 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel dataset, not the 10 m Classified  Pixels.     Figure 1. Left; 10 m classified pixels. Right; the probability associated with each classified pixel; this is  an indicator of classification confidence.    Land Parcel datasets  The Land Parcel datasets are the result of intersecting the 10 m Classified Pixel datasets with the  UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework to generate land parcel attributes (Figure 2, Table 3). 7      Figure 2.

UKCEH LCM Land Parcel product attributes for LCM2022.  UKCEH LCM attribute name  Example  Description  gid    10079  This is a unique identifier for  the land parcel.  _hist  2:3, 11:361  This describes the frequency of  10 m pixels per UKCEH land 8    cover class encountered in a  land parcel given as a list of  tuples <left>:<right> separated  by commas. The figure to the  left of the colon per tuple  represents the UKCEH Land  Cover Class identifier, to the  right  the  frequency  of  occurrence.  _mode  11  This is the most frequently  occurring (modal) land cover  type.  _purity  99.06  This is the percentage of the  modal land cover class over the  total number of pixels (_n)  encountered.  _conf  93.88  This when combined with  _purity helps to understand  classification confidence. It is  the mean polygon value of the  class membership probability  for each pixel, rescaled to the  range of 0 to 100.  _stdev  9.51  This is the standard deviation  of _conf.  _agg  6  This is the aggregate class (see  Table 1).  _n  319  This is the total number of 10 m  pixels intersecting the land  parcel.  ogc_fid  415793  A unique parcel identifier  attribute required during the  production of the spatiaLite  vector product. It is preferable  to use the gid attribute rather  than ogc_fid.    25 m Pixel Rasterised Land Parcel datasets  These are the result of rasterising the Land Parcel dataset into 25 m pixels, with the pixel origin  matching the origin of the British National Grid (for Great Britain) or the Irish National Grid (for  Northern Ireland). Three attributes are carried from the Land Parcel datasets, giving a 3-band raster.   Band 1 is the dominant land cover _mode; band 2 is _conf; and band 3 _purity (see Figure 3). 9      Figure 3. Left top, rasterised land parcels at 25 m pixel resolution. Right-top mean parcel most likely  land cover probability (_conf). Bottom per parcel purity (_purity).    1 km raster products  The 1 km products for LCM2022 were created by summarising the LCM2022 25 m raster data set to  produce percentage cover for each class and to identify the dominant (most widespread) class in each  1 km pixel. The products at 1 km are:   - Dominant cover at 1 km for LCM2022 classes (1 band)   - Dominant cover at 1 km for LCM2022 Aggregate classes (1 band)   - Percentage cover at 1 km for LCM2022 classes (21 bands)   - Percentage cover at 1 km for LCM2022 Aggregate classes (10 bands) 10    For the percentage cover products, integer values are reported, so the rounding of each value means  that in some cases the sum of all the layers may be slightly above or below 100. Around the coast the  values will be sum to less than 100 reflecting the proportion of mapped area in the 1 km square. One  1 km x 1 km pixel covers the area of 1600 25 m pixels, consequently, a land cover type has to cover  more than sixteen 25 m-pixels to exceed 1% of the 1 km pixel area, and hence have a percentage cover  value in the 1 km percentage cover data sets.    Material and Methods  Seasonal Composite Images  Seasonal Composite Images for classification were derived from Google Earth Engine. Sentinel-2  surface reflectance values were resampled to 10 m pixel resolution and median reflectance was  computed for four time periods: January-March, April-June, July-September, and October-December,  using ten Sentinel-2 bands 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8a, 11, and 12 (after Carrasco et. al., 2019), see Table 4.  There were occasional seasonal gaps in the Seasonal Composite Images due to persistent cloud in an  image compositing period which were represented by null data. Fortunately, these data gaps never  occurred at a single location in all four of the Seasonal Composites, ensuring that at least some  Sentinel-2 satellite data were available for classification. Our classification algorithm will tolerate  partially complete spectral information, so we were able to produce land cover for the whole of the  UK without the need to manually fill gaps.   Table 4.

For example, bare rocks in the littoral coastal zone lack significant vegetation, so too do exposed  mountain rocks and sealed urban surfaces. Spectrally these surfaces can appear very similar when  viewed from space and extra detail is required to differentiate them. We used 10 m Context Rasters  to resolve a range of confusion types. For Great Britain, the 10 m Context Rasters were:  1. Height, derived from the NEXTMap® terrain product from Intermap® Solutions.  2. Aspect, derived from the NEXTMap® terrain product from Intermap® Solutions.  3. Slope, derived from the NEXTMap® terrain product from Intermap® Solutions. 11    4. Distance from the nearest building, derived from Ordnance Survey open data.  5. Distance from road, derived from Ordnance Survey open data.  6.

Slope, derived from the NEXTMap® terrain product from Intermap® Solutions.  4. An urban binary mask derived from open data of the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research  Agency.  5.

A tidal water binary mask, derived from Ordnance Survey or Northern Ireland open data.    Classification Scenes  For Great Britain, a grid of tiles based on a modified version of the Ordnance Survey 100 x 100 km tile  grid was created (Figure 4). In total, we classified 32 Classification Scenes comprising full coverage of  the GB land surface. Each Classification Scene was trained and classified independently. The  approximate 100 x 100 km tile size was chosen as this provides a manageable size for processing.  Moreover, if regions were much larger phenological variation due to climatic difference across a  Classification Scene could begin to degrade results. Some tiles such as those encompassing the  Western Isles, Orkney and Shetland, and Cornwall and the Scilly Isles are larger. These are intentionally  enlarged to avoid a sparsity of training data due to the extensive presence of sea in these tiles.  Occasionally where tile extents are modified to include specific areas overlap between adjacent tiles  do occur.  For Northern Ireland, because of its much smaller area, it was possible to use a single Classification  Scene determined by the minimum bounding rectangle of the Northern Ireland land mass (Figure 2).  The 40-band Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Image was combined with Northern Ireland Context  Rasters to produce a 49-band single Classification Scene. 12      Figure 4. Tiles used for selecting Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Images for Great Britain (red) and  Northern Ireland (blue).    The UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework  The UK Land Parcel Spatial Framework used for LCM2022 was originally developed for LCM2007  (Morton et. al., 2011) and a modified version was used for LCM2015. We have had to make some  minor changes since LCM2015. The land parcel geometries are unchanged, but we have re-ordered  database storage and defined new indices to enable faster processing. The consequence of this is that  the unique identifiers (the gid attribute) for each land parcel do not match those provided in the  LCM2015 Land Parcel dataset. For most users this will have no significance, but for users who wish to  compare the new land cover with LCM2015 using parcel identifiers, instead of spatial overlap, this will  not be immediately possible.    Land parcels in the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework have a minimum area of approximately 0.5  hectares, the MMU. The land parcels were derived by generalising national cartography (Morton et.  al., 2011; Smith et. al., 2007) and are designed to represent discrete real-world units of land such as  fields, parks, urban areas, woodlands, lakes and so forth. It is usual, but not universal, that the land  parcels are dominated by a single land cover type. Organising the 10 m Classified Pixels into land  parcels helps to reduce classification noise to provide a clean, easier to use product. It also provides a  convenient fixed structure for comparing land cover over time for change detection.    Bootstrap Training  Bootstrapping is used to refer to a self-starting process that proceeds without external input. UKCEH  have developed an automatic training process for land cover/habitat classification that does not 13    require a fresh collection of (expensive) field-gathered data for classifier training, and we have named  the process Bootstrap Training. Land cover and habitat change is usually gradual. Transitions from one  land cover or habitat to another typically occur over a number of years. Therefore recent habitat/land  cover maps can be a valuable source of training data for a new map if the original maps are accurate  and the update interval of the new map is short relative to target dynamics. When this is true, land  cover observations from the historic maps can be used to sample the current satellite image to  produce training observations. These can then be used by a RF classifier to yield a classification result,  which contributes to the bootstrap for the next map and so forth. Because the historic maps give wall- to-wall coverage they provide a very large number of training observations, which is the key to  learning success. Machine-learning algorithms, such as RF, rely on the majority signal to assign class  membership, so when the Bootstrap Training set is very large if a minor proportion have changed class  (are incorrect) over the refresh interval since these will have little influence on the dominant signal.  The Bootstrap Training dataset for UKCEH LCM2022 came from UKCEH LCM2019, LCM2020 and  LCM2021 classified pixel products. We filtered these land cover products retaining only pixels with  >80% probability and which were classified as the same land cover class across all three years. Figure  5 gives an example of a Bootstrap Training dataset and resulting classification result. Crop rotations  resulting in land cover change between arable and improved grassland classes within the preceding  three-year period, means that in some areas this method is less well suited to producing training data  for these classes. Consequently, training data for arable and improved grassland classes was instead  sourced from the UKCEH Land Cover® plus: Crops data for 2022.    Figure 5. UKCEH Land Cover classes (left), a Bootstrap Training set (centre) and the resultant RF land  cover classification (right).    Random Forest classification  Random Forest (RF) classification (Breiman 2001) is a supervised learning technique that uses a  training set of known observations to derive an empirical relationship which is then used to predict  the membership of unknown observations. Bootstrap Training pixels were placed into labelled bags  and from each bag 10,000 samples, with replacement were drawn to train the RF classifier. The RF  classifier subsequently yields the 10 m Classified Pixel product (for example, Figure 3, right). Sampling  with replacement ensures that all land cover classes have an equal number of pixel observations for  training the RF, this balances learning. Without balanced learning the signal of rarer classes will be  weak and susceptible to domination from commoner classes, causing misclassification. 14    The classification software used for UKCEH LCMs is bespoke and was developed by UKCEH scientific  staff. It integrates the Weka (Frank et. al. 2016) machine learning suite with a PostGIS geospatial  database and gdal tools (https://gdal.org/). These are all open source technologies.    Product validation  LCM2022 was validated using 33,107 validation reference points collected from across the UK and  covering all 21 LCM classes. The reference data is a composite data set, derived from the GB  countryside survey, open source National Forest Inventory data, Rural Payment Agency data and a set  of bespoke LCM validation points generated from manual image interpretation and field collection.  These were intersected with the UKCEH LCM 25 m rasterised polygon datasets to determine  correspondence. The overall accuracy of LCM2022 is 86.1% (Appendix 4).    Known Issues  A small number of polygons are missing from the vector land parcel products, with corresponding  areas of nodata in the derived 25 m rasterised land parcels dataset. This will have a negligible effect  on the 1 km summary raster data products. The 10 m classified pixels datasets are unaffected.

Notes on UKCEH Land Cover Classes   (see also Appendix 2 for a summary of UK BAP Broad Habitat definitions)  UKCEH Land  Cover Class  Notes  Broadleaved  woodland  In the UK BAP Broadleaved, mixed and yew woodland the broadleaved  woodlands are characterised by stands >5 m high with tree cover >20%. Scrub  (<5 m) requires a cover >30 % for inclusion. Such fine distinctions cannot be made  through remote sensing. Open-canopy woodland (stands with trees <50 %) is a  particular problem, albeit occurring relatively rarely. These are likely to be confused  with other classes due to the dominance of the non-woodland understory.   Broadleaved evergreen trees rarely occur in stands >0.5 hectares; an area large  enough to create suitable training areas appropriate for classification.  Consequently the classifier would struggle with this land cover. It is likely these  stands will be classified as Conifer because of the full-year chlorophyll signal.  Mixed woodland stands of broad-leaved or evergreen trees exceeded the minimum  mappable unit, they were treated as separate blocks within the woodland; in many  parts of the UK, truly ‘mixed woodlands’ as opposed to those with mosaic-blocks of  broadleaved and coniferous trees, are unusual.   Stands with near-closed canopies can be interpreted easily in the field and pure  examples can normally be found for training the classifier.   Coniferous  woodland  The UK BAP Coniferous Woodland class includes semi-natural stands and  plantations, with cover >20 %. Classification of coniferous woodland is generally  straightforward, but rare examples of open canopy semi-natural pinewoods are  likely to be classified according to the dominant understorey class.   The UK BAP includes new plantation and recently felled areas. These are land use,  not land cover. Newly felled areas are often dominated by grass, heather and  encroaching vegetation and more likely to be classified as these, instead of  coniferous woodland.  Deciduous larch has potential for confusion with broadleaved deciduous woodland  but is generally correctly identified.  Arable and  Horticulture  The BAP Broad Habitat Arable and Horticulture includes annual crops, perennial  crops such as berries and orchards and freshly ploughed land. This is a very broad  class and as a consequence has large potential for spectral confusion with non- arable surfaces. The main confusion between arable and other classes occurs  between arable land and improved grassland. This is especially likely when  grassland is managed by cutting, followed by periods of low growth and reflectance  from chlorophyll. When this happens the observed seasonal reflectance pattern  can be similar to graminid crops, such as wheat and barley. Indeed grass managed  in this way is technically a crop, so an arable classification is not necessarily wrong. 18    Improved  Grassland  Improved grassland is distinguished from semi-natural grasslands based on its  higher productivity, lack of winter senescence, location and/or context. Grasslands  lie on a continuum, so some confusion with other grassland types is inevitable.  Confusion with grass-like crops will also occur.  Neutral Grassland    The UK BAP Broad Habitat Neutral Grassland is expected to be challenging for  satellite-based classification. BAP Neutral Grassland is defined by botanical  composition and includes semi-improved grasslands managed for silage, hay or  pasture (Jackson, 2000). There is not generally an obvious spectral difference  between these and other productive grass types. However, the inclusion of Context  Rasters for slope and distance to rivers appear to have helped greatly with Neutral  Grassland detection.    Calcareous  Grassland    Calcareous Grassland class is mapped spectrally. However, the inclusion of ancillary  layers for slope is expected to improve results. UKCEH does not have free access to  a highly resolved soil PH/soil type layer, which we would expect to help further. For  regions know to contain substantial coverage of Calcareous Grassland, for example  Limestone Dales of Derbyshire and North Yorkshire, the South Downs and Salisbury  Plain our results match expectations.   Acid Grassland  The UK BAP Acid Grassland can be spectrally variable, depending on dominant  species composition. Deciduous Acid grassland, dominated by Molinea caerula has  a distinct signal from acid grasslands dominated by mixtures other grasses, rushes,  mosses, herbs and sedges. In other work we have been able to refine this class  successfully. However, we did not make this separation in historical maps, so we  are not able to retrieve suitable observations from Bootstrap Training.  Bracken has a very distinctive spectral signal, but only at certain times of the year  when its foliage begins to dominate its grassland understory. Historically, with  restricted availability of satellite images we could not reliably separate the UK BAP  Bracken class from Acid Grassland so we combined these into a single UKCEH Land  Cover Class. With the greater image frequency and therefore better access to  seasonal signals it may now be possible to overcome this historic limitation, but to  do this we will need novel training data as we will not be able to retrieve a signal  from Bootstrap Training.  Heather; and  Heather grassland  For LCM2007 we refined the BAP Dwarf Shrub and Heath into two classes,  depending on the density of Heather, producing the UKCEH Heather and Heather  grassland classes (it is heather when there is greater than 25 % Heather cover). This  was to retain some consistency between the LCM1990 and LCM2000 classes Open  Shrub Heath and Dense Shrub Heath. In some parts of the UK, significant areas of  low-lying non-heather shrubs occur. For example, Gorse can form a dominant shrub  layer.   Note: the Land Cover Maps typically show confusion over Heather, Heather  grassland and Bog. However, they are often difficult to separate in the field.  It is 19    challenging to accurately estimate coverage above and below the defining  threshold.  Fen, Marsh and  Swamp  The UK BAP Fen, Marsh and Swamp includes fen, fen meadows, rush pasture,  swamp, flushes and springs. From a remote sensing perspective Fen, Marsh and  Swamp is problematic as it is can be comprised of a wide range of vegetation types  and many patches are below the MMU of the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial  Framework. The small size of many Fen, Marsh and Swamp patches, plus their  typically mosaic nature make it difficult to find reliable training data. Consequently,  Fen, Marsh and Swamp is likely to be underestimated in some regions. However,  substantial areas of contiguous reed dominated Fenland appear to be well  detected.  Bog  The UK BAP Bog includes ericaceous, herbaceous and mossy swards in areas with a  peat depth >0.5 m. We cannot detect peat depth from satellites.  Vegetation on deep peat soils represent a continuum involving acid grassland,  dwarf shrub heath and some types of fen, marsh and swamp and the separation of  continuously varying land cover into discrete types can be difficult, especially when  they exist in a complex small patch mosaic and their definitions are vague.   We retain the Bog class to maintain consistency with historical UKCEH LCM  products and the RF classifier learns Bog presence based on training data  automatically generated from these. The predicted distribution occurs in regions  where it is expected, so is a good indicator of where Bog is likely to be occurring.  However, Bog and the range of upland vegetation classes expected to occur on  peaty soils (Acid grassland, Fen marsh and swamp, Heather, and Heather grassland)  show a cluster of interclass confusion (Appendix 4). This is partly due fine-scale  variation but largely an effect of ambiguous definitions. UK BAP Broad Habitats (on  which UKCEH Land Cover Classes are based) were not defined with satellite remote  sensing in mind.  Saltwater  Saltwater is rarely different spectrally from freshwater, and the saltwater  distribution predicted by the RF classifier is determined by coastal Context Rasters  in Classification Scenes. There will be some confusion between Saltwater and  Freshwater in tidal rivers, but not substantial. Occasionally, Saltwater is confused  with non-vegetated surfaces close to the coast and this happens because the  automatically generated Saltwater training classes coincide with low-tide  conditions in the satellite view. The effect has so far been trivial but the result is  that we predict Saltwater with slightly lower accuracy than Freshwater. Our main  goal is to map land cover, so coastal water and intertidal regions are lower priority. 20    Freshwater      The UKCEH Freshwater class comes from merging two BAP BHs (Standing Open  Water and Canals, and Rivers and Streams) since they cannot be separated by  spectra. In many cases, small and/or narrow water bodies fall below the MMU of  the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework so effectively disappear into the  dominant surrounding vegetation. Where these features are appropriately aligned  and sufficiently wide, pixels they may be detected and if so will be available in the  Raster Classification datasets.  Water bodies >0.5 ha and wider than 40 m are mapped with very high accuracy.  The exceptions are temporary water bodies and quarries. Water in some quarries  is strongly affected by the minerals in the rock and can result in atypical colours and  misclassification.  Inland Rock  The BAP Broad Habitat Inland Rock covers both natural and artificial exposed rock  surfaces which are >0.25 ha, such as inland cliffs, caves, screes and limestone  pavements, as well as various forms of excavations and waste tips such as quarries  and quarry waste. Opportunistic vegetation is common amongst rocky landscapes.  We classify UKECH Inland Rock if rock has the dominant signature.  Urban; and  Suburban    Within the Built-up Areas and Gardens BAP Broad Habitat we can reliably separate  two UKCEH categories: Urban and Suburban. Urban includes dense urban, such as  town and city centres, where there is little, if any, vegetation. Urban also includes  areas such as dock sides, car parks and industrial estates. It is sometimes confused  with other non-vegetated surfaces; for example open cast quarries or more rarely  coastal rocks or ploughed fields.  Suburban includes suburban areas where the spectral signature is a mix of urban  and vegetation signatures. Suburban and Urban lie on a continuum and confusion  is expected.  Supralittoral Rock Features that may be present in this coastal class include vertical rock, boulders,  gullies, ledges and pools generally forming a narrow band when viewed from above.  Only limited areas can be mapped using satellite remote sensing.   Supralittoral  Sediment  This class includes sand dunes, which are reliably mapped. Areas of coastal sand  may be confused between this class and the littoral sediment class. Supralittoral  sediments can stabilise and from increasing volumes of vegetation. Heavily  vegetated littoral sediment is likely to be classified as a vegetation class.   Littoral Rock  These classes are those in the maritime zone on a rocky coastline. They are  generally more extensive than supralittoral rock and thus more readily detected  using satellite images. 21    Littoral Sediment;  and Saltmarsh      The BAP Broad Habitat Littoral Sediment has a subclass, the BAP Priority Habitat  Saltmarsh. Saltmarsh is generally distinct from nearby vegetation and only occurs  near the coast. As a consequence we can map this well with remote sensing. The  Saltmarsh class is occasionally subject to commission error, when we mistake other  vegetation in the coastal zone (mainly Arable) as Saltmarsh.   The Littoral Sediment is sometimes confused with the Supralittoral Sediment class. 22    Appendix 2. Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats   This appendix provides a brief summary of the JNCC definitions of the Broad Habitats and is based on  Jackson (2000). There is some duplication of material Appendix 2 with Appendix 1. However in  combination they provide users with key information to understand UKCEH Land Cover Classes and  the Broad Habitat definitions they are based on. Note: class numbers here are JNCC’s Broad Habitat  class numbers, not UKCEH Land Cover Class numbers.  The text in this Appendix has been copied from Morton et. al., 2011, with very minor updates to  remove obsolete cross-references to historical projects and documents, plus some corrections. Some  new comments are included regarding BAP Broad Habitat Linear Features and the new 20 m Classified  Pixel datasets.  1. Broadleaved, Mixed and Yew Woodland  This Broad Habitat is characterised by vegetation dominated by trees >5 m high when mature, with  tree cover >20 %. Scrub (<5 m) requires cover >30 % for inclusion in this Broad Habitat. It includes  stands of both native and non-native broadleaved trees and yew. Woodlands dominated by coniferous  species but with >20 % cover by deciduous species are included in this category. Areas of fen woodland  dominated by species such as willow (Salix spp.), alder (Alnus glutinosa) or birch (Betula spp.) are also  included.   2. Coniferous Woodland  This Broad Habitat is characterised by vegetation dominated by trees >5 m high when mature, which  forms a canopy having a cover of >20 %. ‘Coniferous Woodland’ includes semi-natural stands and  plantations and includes both native and non-native coniferous trees.   3. Boundaries and Linear Features  This Broad Habitat type covers a range of linearly arranged landscape features such as hedgerows,  lines of trees, walls, stone and earth banks, grass strips and dry ditches. These features are not  included as a UKCEH Land Cover Class as they are generally too narrow to be reliably captured from  the satellite images. However, linear features are of general interest and an important component of  the landscape. Some linear features will be visible in the 10 m Classified Pixel dataset.   However, regardless of whether or not we can see linear features, we cannot classify them using our  current methods. Linear features are in fact just thin fragments of land cover types that we already  map. Membership in this class is defined by shape, not spectra. We do not have tools for classifying  shapes. New tools for line-finding within the 10 m Classified Pixels products could help with their  detection.   4. Arable and Horticulture  This Broad Habitat includes annual crops, perennial crops, woody crops, intensively managed  commercial orchards, commercial horticultural land (such as nurseries, commercial vegetable plots  and commercial flower growing areas), freshly-ploughed land, annual leys, rotational set-aside and  fallow.  5. Improved Grassland  ‘Improved Grassland’ is characterised by vegetation dominated by a few fast-growing grasses such as  Lolium spp., and also white clover (Trifolium repens), on fertile, neutral soils. Improved grasslands are 23    typically either managed as pasture, or mown regularly for silage production or in non-agricultural  contexts for recreation and amenity purposes.  6. Neutral Grassland  This Broad Habitat type is characterised by vegetation dominated by grasses and herbs on a range of  neutral soils usually with a pH of between 4.5 and 6.5. It includes enclosed dry hay meadows and  pastures, together with a range of grasslands which are periodically inundated with water or  permanently moist.  7. Calcareous Grassland  Calcareous Grassland is characterised by vegetation dominated by grasses and herbs on shallow, well- drained soils which are rich in bases (principally calcium carbonate) formed by the weathering of chalk  and other types of limestone or base-rich rock. Soil pH tends to be high (>6) although it may be as low  as 5.  8. Acid Grassland  Acid Grassland is characterised by vegetation dominated by grasses and herbs on a range of lime- deficient soils, which have been derived from acidic bedrock or from superficial deposits such as sands  and gravels. Such soils usually have a low base status, with a pH of <5.5.   9. Bracken   This Broad Habitat type covers areas dominated by a continuous canopy cover of bracken (Pteridium  aquilinum) at the height of the growing season. It does not include areas with scattered patches of  bracken or areas of bracken, which are less than 0.25 ha. These are included in the Broad Habitat type  with which they are associated.   10. Dwarf Shrub Heath  ‘Dwarf Shrub Heath’ is characterised by vegetation that has >25 % cover of plant species from the  heath family (ericoids) or dwarf gorse Ulex minor. It generally occurs on well-drained, nutrient-poor,  acid soils. This habitat type does not include dwarf shrub dominated vegetation in which species  characteristic of peat-forming vegetation such as cotton grass Eriophorum spp. and peat-building  sphagna are abundant, or that occurs on deep peat (>0.5 m) as these are included in the 'Bog' Broad  Habitat type.   11. Fen, Marsh and Swamp  This habitat includes fen, flushes, springs, fen meadows, rush pasture and swamp. Fens are peatlands  that receive water and nutrients from groundwater and surface runoff, as well as from rainfall. Flushes  are associated with lateral water movement, and springs with localised upwelling of water. Marsh is  a general term usually used to imply waterlogged soil; it is used more specifically here to refer to fen  meadows and rush-pasture communities on mineral soils and shallow peats. Swamps are  characterised by tall emergent vegetation. Reedbeds (i.e. swamps dominated by stands of common  reed Phragmites australis) are also included in this type. Apart from rush pasture, examples of this  Broad Habitat are relatively rare.  12. Bog   This Broad Habitat type covers wetlands that support vegetation that is usually peat-forming and  which receive mineral nutrients principally from precipitation rather than ground water. This is 24    referred to as ombrotrophic (rain-fed) mire. The Bog Broad Habitat includes ericaceous, herbaceous  and mossy swards in areas with a peat depth >0.5 m.  13. Standing Open Water and Canals  This Broad Habitat type includes natural systems such as lakes, meres and pools, as well as manmade  waters such as reservoirs, canals, ponds and gravel pits.  14. Rivers and Streams   The 'Rivers and Streams' Broad Habitat type covers rivers and streams from bank top to bank top, or  where there are no distinctive banks or banks are never overtopped, it includes the extent of the mean  annual flood.  15. Montane  The ‘Montane Habitats’ category includes a range of vegetation types that occur exclusively in the  montane zone such as prostrate dwarf shrub heath, snow-bed communities, sedge and rush heaths,  and moss heaths. The distinction between the sub-montane and montane zone is often blurred and  the two usually merge through a band of transitional vegetation.  16. Inland Rock  This Broad Habitat type covers both natural and artificial exposed rock surfaces which are >0.25 ha,  such as inland cliffs, caves, screes and limestone pavements, as well as various forms of excavations  and waste tips such as quarries and quarry waste.  17. Built-Up Areas and Gardens  This Broad Habitat type covers urban and rural settlements, farm buildings, caravan parks and other  manmade built structures such as industrial estates, retail parks, waste and derelict ground, urban  parkland and urban transport infrastructure. It also includes domestic gardens and allotments. This  type does not include amenity grassland, which should be included in the 'Improved Grassland'  category.  18. Supralittoral Rock  This habitat occurs above the high water mark, in areas influenced by wave splash and sea spray.  Features that may be present include vertical rock, boulders, gullies, ledges and pools, depending on  the wave exposure of the site and its geology.  19. Supralittoral Sediment  This habitat occurs above the high water mark, but in areas influenced by wave splash and sea-spray.  It includes shingle beaches, sand dunes and machair.  20. Littoral Rock  The geology and wave exposure of the shore influence the form of Littoral Rock habitats, which can  be as varied as vertical rock, shore platforms, boulder shores, or rocky reefs surrounded by areas of  sediment. In general, Littoral Rock tends to be colonised by algae in wave-sheltered conditions, and  by limpets, barnacles and mussels as wave-exposure increases. 25    21. Littoral Sediment  Areas of Littoral Sediment are widespread around the UK forming features such as beaches, sand  banks, and intertidal mudflats. A large proportion of this habitat occurs in estuaries and inlets where  it can cover extensive areas. Saltmarsh is included within this Broad Habitat.  22. Inshore Sublittoral Sediment  All areas of sea and estuary class are assumed to be Inshore Sublittoral Sediment. It is defined as within  six nautical miles of the shoreline by JNCC. 26    Appendix 3.

ccarY: specific northing of BFI value
  Before being processed for RGB data, it has a mask applied to it that just extracts the surrounding, north facing field:     Or rather, only this gets processed:     The PhenoCams take up to 5 images a day. The daily GCC is taken to be the image with the highest value of that day. Please note, this RGB dataset has not undergone any quality control. Quality control The daily values are not subjected to their own quality control. Instead they are all derived from sub-hourly values which have been quality controlled. See Section 3.6 for details on this. Data flags Data flags are provided in a separate file: COSMOS-UK_<SITE ID>_HydroSoil_Daily_<YEAR SITE OPENED>-2023_Flags.csv The data flag files mirror the structure of their counterpart data file, except that all column names have “_FLAG” appended. See section 3.7 for details.                    Infilling Infilling is the process of providing estimates of data values where there are gaps in the time series record.  Simple infilling is carried out using interpolation methods. This is only applied to selected variables, and for gaps that are considered reasonable. Interpolation uses data around the gap to estimate the values in between. It is very effective for small gaps, and for data that has low variability, for example temperature and pressure, but less so for variables with high variability, like precipitation. The variables chosen for infilling are listed in Table 3.1 and Table 4.1, for sub-hourly and daily data respectively. There two different types of interpolation used: Linear interpolation – this creates values that make a straight line across the gap. Order 2 Polynomial – this uses a larger window of data around the gap to create a smoother, curved line of points. In order to determine which to use, the processing script answers three questions: Is the gap less than (or equal to) 10 values? How many values are there around the gap? If there is just 1 value each side, then only linear interpolation can be used. If possible, larger gaps will use more (up to 4) values each side to estimate a polynomial interpolation. Which interpolation method is the best? Each combination of gap size, interpolation type, and values around the gap has an associated RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) score that provides an estimate of which method works best. To calculate RMSE scores for each method, 5000 artificial, independent gaps are created with the chosen gap length and then infilled with the specific interpolation. With the results the RMSE is calculated between the estimates and the real values. This is completed for each variable chosen to be infilled.          Completeness Figure 6.1 outlines the percentage completeness of data over the period October 2013 - December 2023. The ‘Met’ and ‘Soil’ columns combine groups of measured variables and give the overall completeness. ‘VWC’ is the completeness of the derived volumetric water content data from the CRNS. Met = Precipitation, humidity, air temperature, atmospheric pressure, short and long wave radiation, and wind speed and direction. Soil = Soil heat flux, soil temperature, and volumetric water content measured by TDT sensors.   Figure 6.1 – Completeness of data for each site, for combined sets of variables.

Table 7.2 – Details of site setup.  rain[E] height adjustment The recommended rim height for a rain gauge in the UK is 0.305 meters above short grass; high enough to prevent splashing from ground surface, but not too high to be prone to wind undercatch effects (Muchan & Dixon 2019). However, this requires high levels of maintenance to ensure that the surrounding area of vegetation is kept sufficiently short to reduce the chance of blockages. We have found that, due to the extent or our network, we are unable to maintain this level of ground maintenance at all COSMOS-UK sites. As a result, we have seen loss of data from rain[e] gauges due to blockages from overgrown grass and other surrounding vegetation (particularly in summer months). Therefore, in 2023 we made the decision to raise rain[e] gauges to a rim height of 1.0 meters to reduce the chance of blockages. Although this means the rain[e] gauges may be more prone to wind undercatch issues, it provides a more reliable and consistent data stream.  This also means that the rain[e] gauges are at the same height as the Pluvio rain gauges. Table 7.3 lists the dates that the rain[e] gauges were raised at each site. Table 7.3 - Dates of rain[e] height adjustments   Changes to data Data processes are under constant review. Where improvements are made, the full time series is reprocessed.

Re-Bugging the System: Promoting Adoption of Alternative Pest  Management Strategies in Field Crop Systems, 2005-2009    Conservation Biological Control Experiments Data    USER GUIDE End of Award Report RES-224-25-0093-A    Re-Bugging the System: Promoting Adoption of Alternative Pest Management  Strategies in Field Crop Systems.   (Overcoming Market and Technical Obstacles to Alternative Pest Management in  Arable Systems)      Background   Weeds, pests and diseases cause serious crop yield and quality losses and  consequently less food is available for human consumption. In the context of  global population growth, changing diets, increased per capita consumption and  competition for land with other uses, it is vital that little potential output is lost.     Pesticides have been effective in limiting crop losses in the recent past.  Alongside advances in fertilisers and genetics, pesticides have helped to realise  dramatic increases in production over the last 60 years.    Overuse of pesticides leads to pesticide resistance, by creating strong selection  pressure among pest biotypes, and can present challenges to the environment.  Thus, complementary alternatives are required to prolong the life of effective  pesticides and to limit the environmental impact of farming.     Furthermore, some consumers are concerned by both the environmental and  potential risks to human health consequences of pesticide use. Some are willing  to reveal these preferences by purchasing Organic foods but many more express  significant concerns when asked.  While certain retailers use contracts to ensure  food is free from pesticide residues, and capture demand for ‘safe’ food, there  remains a significant role for policy to reduce threat to biodiversity.    Heightened EU regulations, such as directive EC 91/414, are leading to the  withdrawal of many pesticide products currently in use. However, the world has  come to rely on relatively secure and plentiful food supplies to sustain large  human populations. Thus, there exists a real demand for alternative pest control  technologies from a range of stakeholders across the food chain. However, these  more benign technologies must provide similar levels of crop protection.      Objectives  A wide range of technologies exist that can reduce farmers’ reliance on  pesticides. Few have the capability to compete with chemical control on their  own. However, when used in combination they are far more effective. This has  been long understood and led to the development of Integrated Pest  Management (IPM), as applied in a wide variety of agro-ecosystems.    To some degree, all farmers benefit from IPM since natural enemies are always  present in the landscape, helping to control pest populations. There are many  potential technologies which could be used in IPM approaches. The main  techniques currently used in arable crops are:  cultural means, principally crop rotations and resistant varieties, to  minimise the risk of infestation;    assess pest abundance and apply pesticides only if economic thresholds  are exceeded   conservation biocontrol that seeks to maximise the effects of natural  enemies of pests by using selective products and encourage their  numbers by providing the required resources.    Most farmers adopt only some of these approaches and are not capitalising on the  benefits of a fully integrated approach.    The objective of this research was to assess the reasons why few arable farmers  consciously use IPM. We focused on a narrow set of technical approaches to biological  control of aphid pests in UK wheat production as our model system. Within this system  we aimed to consider the technical efficacy of 2 biocontrol techniques in isolation and  when used together. Issues we thought would be fruitful in the technical arena included:   1. the potential benefits of combining technical approaches, specifically those of  conservation biocontrol (CBC) and semiochemical push-pull technologies,   2. the effect of uncroped land in the surrounding landscape over a range of scales  on control system properties and performance and  3. to consider how best to provide conservation biocontrol services from land use  manipulations and vegetative composition on that land.    We further wished to consider the possibility that low levels of commercial interest in  biocontrol in general could be blamed on market failure. Here we considered the  following aspects:  1. the importance of the external consequences of pesticide use in UK arable  agriculture and to consider ways in which these could be taken into account by  users of pesticides.  2. how commercial farmers approach the decision, or multiple decisions, to switch  there pest control technologies from pesticide based to an IPM system based on  an array of biocontrol approaches.  3. the role of risk preferences and perception on commercial technology adoption  decisions.  In the interdisciplinary setting, we aimed to develop a set of approaches to the  investigation, development and communication of novel crop protection technologies to  commercial farmers.    As this award commenced, the UK government introduced a set of policy measures  directed at farmers aimed at promoting biodiversity conservation in the farmed  landscape. Unlike previous policy initiatives these policies, the Entry Level Scheme  (ELS) in particular, were widely targeted rather than aimed at just farmers with land of  high biodiversity value. As such, many of our research questions required reformulation  as the landscape in which they were to be assessed changed in a rapid and far  reaching way. One important example was that field scale and landscape scale trial  sites comprising differing habitat complexity became difficult to find and much of our  CBC scale research required significant redesign. As farmers began to take-up their ELS commitments, it became clear that issues in the  social science arena also changed. Once farmers were being paid for land use change  which had the potential to provide the habitats which can promote beneficials then our  technology adoption and risk perception studies became redundant. Our focus changed  to that of considering what farmers were doing and what further approaches they may  consider for the future, as marginal changes to functioning IPM programmes.       Methods  In order to address these issues, a wide range of experimental and observational  research across disciplines of economics, sociology, biochemistry, ecology and  entomology was conducted.    Choice experiments – willingness to pay (WTP) for reduced pesticide foods –  food safety – environmental safety  Two Choice Experiments (CE) were used to examine consumer preferences for food  produced using different quantities of pesticides while accounting for the different  threats that pesticides can present. In cereals production the impact of pesticide use is  primarily on environmental quality. For horticultural production the potential effect is on  consumer health. A survey was distributed to 3000 households drawn from a  commercial mailing list stratified by age, income and county of residence. From a  response rate of 15.8%, the final number of responses was 420.    Latent class estimators were used to calculate WTP and these were placed in a policy  context by calculation of an equivalent pesticide tax.  Other novel estimators were  applied in an attempt the counter the problem of lexicographic preferences and potential  “ya saying” behaviour among respondents.    Farmer Pest management Practice Survey   Following a piloting exercise a pest management focussed farmer survey instrument  was developed. The survey asked farmers for information on the area, yield and prices  obtained for their most important crops, as organic or conventional, and to report on use  of insecticides as a 3 year average. A series of questions designed to elicit their  attitudes to a range of aspects of pesticides was included. Data was recorded on their  use, and views, of a range of 17 pest management practices. Finally, farmers were  asked to report their membership of agri-environmental schemes (AES), of the  Voluntary Initiative, the sources they trust for advice and a range of other characteristics  data.     Delivery was achieved alongside the Home Grown Cereals Authority newsletter during  the 2007 crop year. The survey instrument was sent out to 7,500 randomly selected  names from newsletter recipient list. A single mail out strategy with no follow-up was  employed. Some 645 surveys were returned which compares favourably with similar  work. Following screening of returns for non-participation and incomplete responses the  sample fell to 571 useable observations. The data generated by this survey were subjected to 3 sets of analysis. Firstly, Principle  Component Analysis was used to summarise the Pest Management (PM) practice data  and to generate factor scores for use in regression analysis to estimate the  determinants of IPM adoption and to consider the impact of IPM on insecticide use.  Secondly, both parametric and non-parametric count data models were used to  estimate the determinants of the adoption of more complex sets of PM practices and  finally, Quantile Regression will be used to assess this question from a different angle.  This latter work is ongoing.    Interdisciplinary Researchers Interviews  These interviews were conducted between Jan07 to April07 with researchers engaged  on this award and with 3 researchers undertaking award RES-224-25-0048 “Biological  Alternatives to Chemical Pesticide Inputs in the Food Chain”. Each interview was  conducted in a semi-structured format and each discussion was digitally recorded for  subsequent content analysis using NVivo software. We anticipate that this work will  generate a Journal submission late in 2009.    Field scale CBC Trials   Field studies examined the effects of scale of adoption on the effectiveness and  sustainability of alternative pest control technologies based on habitat management.  Using cereal aphids as a model pest the studies determined:   the effectiveness and type of pest natural enemies providing cereal aphid control   how levels of aphid control and natural enemy abundance were affected by  landscape features, especially uncropped land and the provision of additional  uncropped land created in agri-environment schemes   the factors effecting the distribution and movement of natural enemies   the within-field distribution of natural enemies and the use of floral resources    In 2005 the effectiveness and type of pest natural enemies providing cereal aphid  biocontrol was determined in exclusion cages previously infested with the grain aphid,  Sitobion avenae. The following treatments were compared as described in Holland et  al. (2008a): E) epigeal (ground-active) predators only; F) flying natural enemies only; A)  all natural enemies; N) no natural enemies.    To differentiate the impact on cereal aphids of parasitoids compared to predatory  invertebrates, a replicate study was conducted in a field of winter wheat in 2006 and  2007. Exclusion cages were used to create these treatments: no natural enemies, flying  predators but no parasitoids, flying natural enemies, all natural enemies. Parasitoids  were repelled using the semiochemical n-tricosane.    Role of habitats in cereal aphid biocontrol  In 2006, 14 fields were selected on separate farms each with different amounts of grass  margins.  Natural enemy exclusion cages were established at 80 m from the boundary  using the same methodology as in 2005. In 2007, the study was repeated on 12 of the  farms, but in different fields owing to crop rotations. Natural enemies were measured in  the adjacent crop. Movement of flying predators was measured in 12 of the fields in  2006, using eight cylindrical sticky traps positioned at 40 m from the margin equidistantly around the field. Traps were operated for 10 weeks from the beginning of  April. The type and location of all cropped and uncropped land within a 1000 m radius  of the natural enemy transect was entered into a GIS system. The effect of type of  exclusion was determined using ANOVA. GLMs were conducted to identify whether  there were any linear relationships between the type and amount of uncropped land  (hedge, linear grass features and flowers-rich areas) and the levels of cereal aphid  control achieved by the flying and epigeal predators for buffer zones of 100, 250, 500  and 750 m radius from the exclusion cages. The same approach was used for  analysing data on the predatory invertebrates.    Evaluation of floral resource usage  A novel tracking technique was employed to determine usage of floral resources.  Rubidium chloride was applied to a floral strip, where it was absorbed by the plant, and  subsequently passed to any insect either feeding directly on the plant tissues including  the pollen and nectar or indirectly to insects predating those that had previously fed  upon the rubidium treated plants. Rubidium was then detected within plant and insect  tissues using Flame Emission Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry.    Pilot studies were conducted to confirm that rubidium could be detected in hoverflies  feeding directly upon the pollen and nectar and indirectly to ladybirds predating  herbivorous insects.   To assess usage of a flower-rich margin by predatory insects foraging in the adjacent  fields a flower-rich margin 10 m wide and 0.5 km long (total area 0.5 ha) was sprayed  with Rubidium chloride on the 23 June and 13 July 2008. A grid of 77 sticky traps was  established up to 365m into the wheat field and 60 m into the spring barley that  bounded the flower-rich margin. . Sticky traps were operated for two four-day periods  following spraying. Low numbers of aphid predators were trapped on the first two  sampling occasions, therefore yellow sticky traps were also added on the next two  trapping occasions.  All aphid predators and alate aphids were identified on the sticky  traps. Cereal aphids were recorded adjacent to each sticky trap during the first three  occasions the sticky traps were active. Owing to high capture of hoverflies on the yellow  traps, only 50% of the female hoverflies captured on the third sampling occasion were  analysed for rubidium.  Flowers and uppermost leaves of the most abundant flower  (Trifolium hybridum, a known food source for hoverflies) in the flower rich margin were  also analysed for rubidium content.    Predator  and  cereal  aphid  distribution  patterns  assessed,  using  spatially  autocorrelation, in SADIE.        Evaluation of Semiochemicals   Semiochemical based pest control approaches are designed to reduce insect  colonisation of crops by modifying insect behaviour and development. Using the natural  plant activator cis-jasmone as a model, studies aimed to:   Develop effective formulations for field use   Determine the response of natural enemies to treated plants   Identify suitable crop varieties   Investigate effects on pest populations in the field at  increasing scales Release rate properties of different formulations  Volatile semiochemicals are difficult to formulate for slow release on a large scale. We  investigated release properties of novel microencapsulated and gum acacia cis- jasmone formulations that would be suitable for mass production.  Oilseed rape plants  were sprayed with test formulations at a rate equivalent to 50g/ha. Release of cis- jasmone was then quantified by headspace sampling (Agelopoulos et al. 2000) for 30  minute collection periods 4, 24, 48 and 72 h after the spray treatment.    Foraging Bioassay  Individual female parasitoids (Aphidius ervi or A. rhopalosiphi) were released onto  wheat seedlings and foraging behaviour was observed. Bioassays compared parasitoid  behaviour on cis-jasmone treated (formulation in Bruce et al 2003) and control plants.  Data were analysed using a paired t-test (Genstat).    Semi-field arena trial to assess the potential for enhancing CBC   These trials investigated effects of cis-jasmone on parasitoids on a larger scale. Two  circular arenas (60cm height, 2m diameter) constructed from insect-proof mesh were  set up in a polytunnel (Cook et al., 2007). In each replicate 6 pots of wheat seedlings  were arranged in a circle inside the arena. One hour prior to the test, pots were infested  with 50 Sitobion avenae. Ten mated female parasitoids were released at the centre of  the arena after 1 hour of acclimatisation and removed after 24h. Plants were kept for 2  weeks after which aphid numbers and percentage parasitism were recorded. These  data were analysed with statistical software (Genstat).    Pest colonisation of wheat varieties treated with cis-jasmone  Replicated small plots of winter wheat varieties, Consort, Hereward, Solstice and  Welford were either left untreated or treated with cis-jasmone released from point  sources in the centre of each plot. Visual assessments of cereal aphid populations  (Rhopalosiphum padi, S. avenae and Metopolophium dirhodum) and eggs of the gout  fly (Chlorops pumilionis) were made on 100 plants/tillers per plot three times in October  and once a week in June-July. Larvae of gout fly (25 plants per plot) and orange wheat  blossom midge, Sitodiplosis mosellana (25 wheat ears/plot) were assessed. Data were  subjected to ANOVA.    Field-scale experiments with cis-jasmone  Field plots treated with cis-jasmone (50g in 200 litres ha-1 formulated with 0.1% EBV or  3% gum acacia) were compared to an untreated control.  In the first experiment in  wheat cv. Solstice assessments of aphids and their natural enemies were made weekly  from May–July (36 samples per plot; 6 replicate plots per treatment). The second  experiment consisted of two ~1ha plots of wheat, cv. Solstice, and the third two ~2ha  plots of spring peas, cv. Ragtime. In both experiments, 1 plot of each crop was  untreated and the other was sprayed with cis-jasmone (EBV formulation). Plots were  assessed visually for the wheat or by Vortice suction at each sampling point on the  peas. Where possible, data were subjected to ANOVA.    Control Cage Abundance and Complexity work   Research at Imperial College examined the role of natural enemy diversity on the  biological control of arable crop pests. The community of natural enemies and aphid pests of cereal crops was used as a model system and a series of mesocosm  experiments conducted under controlled environment conditions.  Using mesocosms  we were able to manipulate and monitor precisely the natural enemy and prey  compositions, which included species of ladybirds, hoverflies, ground and rove beetles,  spiders, parasitoids and up to three species of cereal aphid. Biodiversity experiments  such as these are highly factorial, and require considerable replication to overcome the  natural variability of the system. To test hypothesis and understand the underlying  mechanisms we used a range of models and inference statistics (classical and  Bayesian), and also conducted formal comparisons of commonly used experimental  designs to improve the interpretation and application of biodiversity experiments. The  vast majority of diversity-function studies reported in the scientific literature examine  functional changes attributable to alterations in species richness only, but all attributes  of diversity contribute to net function in a community including species richness and  identity, abundance, evenness and interactions between individuals leading to indirect  or non-additive effects within and between species. We conducted a series of  experiments to examine how each of these attributes contributes to pest control  function and to identify the underlying mechanisms driving these patterns.      Interdisciplinarity  Although the team met twice a year, the research staff teams, each responsible for the  different research strands, were employed at different locations. The team envisaged  that much of our interdisciplinary understanding, and the spur of our integration, would  precipitate from among the staff at Wye. The dismantling of all Interdisciplinary capacity  at Wye was a significant blow.     Regular, biannual, research team meetings were held, each over 2 days, provided  ample opportunity for both professional and social interaction. In addition, telephone  conversations were used to maintain a momentum in that relationship and help steer  interdisciplinary collaboration.    At the mid-point of the award, we embarked on an exercise to investigate how our  various disciplines, plus some from a sister award, approached the wider framing of our  research. A set of semi-structured interviews with 14 diverse researchers were  conducted. The main theme of the interviews was to understand how each interviewee  would approach the construction of a bio-economic model for pest control. These  interdisciplinary researcher interviews were subjected to context analysis in order to  highlight the different approaches researchers would consider and to uncover  differences in emphasis different disciplines place on system components and on  system drivers. This work remains ongoing and we anticipate a journal submission  shortly.    Joint Publications  Griffiths, G.J.K., Holland, J.M., Bailey, A.S. and Thomas, M.B.

Results  Consumer Willingness to Pay Study  The application of latent class models for both Choice Experiments (CEs) found  evidence to support the presence of preference heterogeneity of respondents’  attitudes  towards  reductions  in  pesticide  categories,  with  respect  to  environmental quality and food safety. The latent class analysis identifies the  presence of 3 preference groups in the Bread CE and 2 in the Fruits and  Vegetables CE. The results suggest that, for consumer health, respondents’  WTP for a 100% reduction in pesticide use is £6.85 per week, a 105% increase  in a weekly fruit and vegetable bill.  For environmental quality, results report a  WTP for a 100% reduction in pesticide use equivalent to £0.92 per loaf, a 184%  increase in the price of a loaf. These estimates are large, although similar to  those published elsewhere.  Two equivalent additive pesticide tax rates were  computed, one for products used on cereals and another for those used in  horticulture. For ‘cereals’ products, the tax, applied uniformly to all pesticide  classes, is £7.07 per kg active ingredient. In the case of those pesticides used in  horticulture the additive pesticide tax is £104 per kg active ingredient. Both tax  rates are quite small and are unlikely to compromise the industry.    Factor, IPM Portfolio Analysis: What are farmers currently doing or would  consider doing?  Most UK conventional farmers, collectively the largest group by area, rely on  pesticides for weed, disease and pest control. However, survey results show that  many farmers are, or will consider, using practices which can aid crop protection  and reduce pesticide use. Figure 1 shows the popularity of a range of  technologies which can help protect arable crops within surveyed farms. 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% Using a Trap Crop Pheromone Control Introducing Predators Using Mixed Varieties Within Field Pheromone Monitoring Using Beetle Banks Floristic Strips to Encourage Beneficials Cultivation to Control Weeds Spot Spray Rotating Pesticide Classes  Different Varieties in Different Fields Hand Rogueing Disease- or Insect-Resistant Varieties Adjusting Time of Operations  Treating Seeds Improving Field Margins  Planned Crop Rotation Techniques % of Respondents Will Not Use Discontinued Consider for Future Currently Used   Figure 1: Adoption of pest control methods (percentages)    This survey of practice and attitude also revealed that farmers have combined the  practices  they  adopt  into  logical  IPM  “Portfolios”.

These  include Field Margins, Beetle Banks and Floral Strips but these are usually established  for reasons other than IPM and AES objectives down-play IPM promotion.    The survey results report that UK arable farmers are using a range of techniques to  control pests, diseases and weeds, and very few respondents appear to rely solely on  pesticides. The choice of IPM portfolio differs across the sample and regression  analysis suggests that heterogeneity is caused by farm type, tenure and AES  engagement while other, unobserved farm characteristics also likely play an important  role. Further regression analysis shows that practices which modify the cropped  environment, (Portfolio 1) appear to reduce insecticide use. There was no statistical  support for a similar affect from Portfolio 3 which should concern advocates of CBC.    Count Data analysis of PM technology adoption  This work focuses on the explanation of the number of technologies employed following  Lohr and Park, (2002). Using the farmer survey data collected here, both parametric  and non-parametric count data models were estimated. The nonparametric methods of  Racine and Li (2004) produced the preferred set of results which also avoided sample  splitting and the specification of functional form. This model suggests that full-time,  younger arable farmers on larger farms in the southern and eastern parts of the UK  employ the largest number of PM technologies. These results suggest that organic  farmers do not adopt more complex PM portfolios than conventional farms. Adoption of  PM technologies appears to be driven by both farm specific characteristics and  agronomic and climatic factors. The spatial interpretation of the results reveals the  anomaly that farmers in the South East region (SE) adopted fewer technologies than  have their near neighbours, counter to the general result. Possible explanations include;  1. lower regional pest pressure, 2. that spatial network effects limit the returns to or  produce psychological barriers to innovation, 3. the Rural Payments Agency implements  different AES rules in the SE. Discounting the first explanation, it seems likely that the  combined influence of differential policy implementation and farmer to farmer  communication could be highly influential in IPM technology adoption.    Field scale CBC Trials Determining the effectiveness and type of pest natural enemies providing cereal aphid  biocontrol   Where flying natural enemies had access (F and A) aphids failed to increase in contrast  to where there were only epigeal predators or total exclusion (E and N) (Figure 2). On  the final sampling occasion, compared to where all predators were present, flying  natural enemies reduced aphids by 90% and 93% in fields with standard and wide field  margins respectively, whereas epigeal predators only achieved reductions of 40% and  18%. Aphid parasitism were very low (<3%) in most cages.        Figure 2: Mean number (± 1 SE) of aphids per ear for each type of exclusion cage at 10,  20 and 31 days after inoculation with Sitobion avenae.     83% of invertebrates captured in pitfall traps were predatory but margin width and  distance from the field margin had no significant effect on their numbers. Carabid and  staphylinid diversity were significantly higher at 20 than 80 m from the field margin  Holland et al. (2008a).    Predatory invertebrates captured on the sticky traps were significantly higher in the  fields with wider margins, but only in early May. In addition, Cantharidae (soldier  beetles) and Tachyporus species (rove beetles) were more abundant in fields with  wider margins in early June Oaten et al. (2007).    In both years there was no significant difference between the level of aphid control  provided by flying natural enemies with and without parasitoids, but flying predators  effectively controlled the cereal aphids.    Role of habitats in cereal aphid biocontrol  Results from the predator exclusion experiments in 2006 and 2007 were consistent with  those found in 2005 Holland et al. (2008b).     Aphid control by flying natural enemies increased reciprocally with the area of grass  margins within 250, 500 and 750 m of the exclusion cages.  In contrast, increasing the  area of hedgerow within 100m, 500 and 750 m radii reduced aphid control by the  epigeal predators.    Numbers of Cantharidae on sticky traps in the crop declined significantly as the area of  margins increased probably because the margins were a more attractive habitat. In contrast, earlier in the year, margins were a source of one natural enemy group, the  Tachyporus species Oaten et al. (2008).    Evaluation of floral resource usage  Adult hoverflies and ladybirds were successfully marked with rubidium through  application to a flower-rich margin. Clover plants retained high concentrations of  rubidium for at least seven days after spraying.    Few cereal aphids were found on the wheat plants but high numbers of alate cereal  aphids were caught on the clear sticky traps, with clustering into several patches.  Empididae (predatory flies) and hoverflies were the most abundant natural enemies. All  and female hoverflies were heterogeneously distributed on the third and fourth sampling  occasions and with fewer aphids on the third sampling occasion where there were more  hoverflies. Empididae were strongly aggregated into patches that coincided with the  aphid patches determined from sticky traps.     867 female hoverflies were tested for rubidium, of which only 13 were considered  marked. Most of these were captured in close proximity (<150 m) to the flower-rich  margin.     In summary, flying predatory invertebrates provided the most effective aphid control the  most abundant of which were the predatory flies (Syrphidae, Empididae and  Dolichopodidae), predatory beetles (Staphylinidae and Cantharidae) and spiders which  balloon. Aphid control improved as the proportion of grass margins increased between  250-750 m of the field, indicating that biocontrol can be improved through habitat  manipulation funded by AES. Grass margins benefit natural enemies by providing  overwintering and foraging resources. Hoverflies, parasitoids and predatory beetles  may benefit from margins providing pollen and nectar. In this study, however, there was  little evidence that the hoverflies found within the crop had foraged on the adjacent  flower-rich margin. This requires further research making use of the rubidium marking  technique that was successfully developed.       Semiochemical Trials   Release rate properties of different formulations  Microencapsulated formulations did not provide sustained release for more than 48h  (Fig. 3). The gum acacia formulation had a lower initial release rate but release was  sustained for 6 days. The gum acacia formulation was selected for field trials. Figure 3: Release rate of cis-jasmone from oilseed rape plants treated with different  formulations      Foraging Bioassay  Significantly more time (a mean of 16.6 min) was spent by A. ervi on cis-jasmone  induced wheat plants than on control plants (7.6 min).     In contrast, cis-jasmone induction had no effect on the foraging behaviour of  A. rhopalosiphi. Mean time spent on induced and control plants was 12.4 and 14.1  minutes, respectively.      Semi-field arena trial  Performance of A. ervi was enhanced by cis-jasmone treatment: aphid numbers were  significantly reduced and percentage parasitism was significantly higher on induced  plants. This finding supports a study with Arabidopsis where it was found that cis- jasmone treatment made plants more attractive to A. ervi (Bruce et al., 2008). It extends  the study of cis-jasmone on indirect defence and tritrophic interactions to a crop plant  and confirms that the interaction is enhanced when aphids are present, helping to  explain the reductions in aphid infestations observed in field trials with cis-jasmone  treated wheat (Bruce et al., 2003). However, as found in the foraging bioassay, cis- jasmone did not enhance the performance of A. rhopalosiphi (Bruce et al in prep) which  probably lies on different cues more specific to its’ particular host aphid-plant complex.     Use of natural enemies for CBC is limited in annual field crops by difficulties in  maintaining sufficient densities in the crop before levels of insect herbivores become  economically damaging (Bradburne & Mithen, 2000). Induction of crop plants with cis- jasmone could provide a solution to this by enhancing parasitoid activity. Enhancing  favourability of wheat to the generalist parasitoid A. ervi becomes particularly relevant  when wheat crops are adjacent to more natural vegetation in which the more generalist  parasitoids occur. Pest colonisation of wheat varieties treated with cis-jasmone  In the autumn there was a significant reduction in aphid numbers on cis-jasmone  treated plots (Figure 4). Aphid numbers were also lower on most treated varieties in  summer with a statistically significant reduction on cv Solstice (Figure 5). cis-Jasmone  treated plots had significantly fewer gout fly eggs than the controls, but there was no  varietal effect.  Numbers of gout fly larvae were not significantly reduced by the  treatment, but there were significantly more larvae in Hereward and Welford compared  to the other two varieties.        Figure 4: Cereal aphid numbers on cis-jasmone treated compared to untreated plots             Figure 5 : Numbers of cereal aphids colonising  wheat variety Solstice with and without  cis-jasmone treatment There was a very low orange wheat blossom midge infestation and no differences  between the treatments except for midge-resistant Welford. Numbers of parasitoids and  predators were too low for analysis.    Despite low aphid infestations, the cis-jasmone treatment produced a consistent trend  towards reduction in colonisation and population size. The fact that wheat varieties  respond differentially to priming or induction of defence mechanisms by plant signals is  a new finding and suggests that control could be improved by using activators in an IPM  package where they are combined with appropriate varieties.     Field-scale experiments with cis-jasmone  In both years cereal aphid numbers were very low with the main immigration occurring  in late June. The most numerous species was M. dirhodum. The low aphid numbers  meant that no firm conclusions could be drawn from trials 1 and 2.    In trial 3, aphids (mostly Acyrthosiphon pisum) arrived early, in large numbers and were  fairly evenly distributed across the two pea plots prior to the first application of cis- jasmone. Following treatment aphid numbers were significantly lower by 19 June on the  cis-jasmone plot (Figure 6).                Figure 6: Plot of the distribution of A. pisum (aphids/sample) on pea plots on 19/6/08     Although the wheat trials did not produce significant results due to low aphid numbers,  the gum acacia formulation was more effective than the wetter and research into  formulation will continue. The field trial in peas showed that cis-jasmone can be  effective at this scale. However, overall the field-scale trials demonstrated the need for  replication and also for more consideration of landscape detail.    Control Cage Abundance and Complexity work   Key results from research at Imperial College improve our understanding of diversity- function relationships and how biodiversity may be managed to enhance ecosystem  services such as pest control. By manipulating species richness, at different population  levels, a positive effect of species richness is found, especially at higher total predator  untreated  cis-jasmone       N population levels. This is driven by lower levels of intraspecific interference that would  depress pest control in species-poor communities, and the positive effects of resource- use differentiation and synergistic interactions among complementary species that  improve pest control in species-rich communities (Griffiths et al 2008a).     Natural enemy species were highly idiosyncratic in their predatory potential, and as a  consequence, variability in pest control was greatest among species-poor communities.  Predator species identity is clearly an important component to consider for maximising  pest control function when natural enemy species richness is low.   Substantial  increases in pest control may be achieved by augmenting populations with single,  highly effective species, but these must be selected to minimise the limitations of  intraspecific interference. However, where natural enemy populations are intermediate  or high, it may be more advantageous to increase diversity to increase representation of  functionally complementary species.     Balanced natural enemy assemblages outperformed dominant assemblages, resulting  in around 14% higher predation where predator species were evenly represented  (Griffiths et al. in review). This pattern was driven by intra- and interspecific interference  in dominant assemblages that depress predation levels and a combination of resource- use differentiation and synergistic interactions that enhance predation in balanced  communities.     The observed impact of community balance on predation has implications for the  design and interpretation of diversity-function studies and management of biodiversity  to maximise ecosystem services. Biodiversity experiments typically use an even  species-abundance distribution, and as a result may consistently overestimate the  frequency of positive or neutral effects for a given species-richness. The data suggest  that pest control services may be enhanced by increasing the balance of natural enemy  assemblages, with the added benefit of reducing the extinction risk of rare species.     Additionally, measures of variability are particularly important for ecosystem services  such as crop protection which tend to have clear biological and economic thresholds,  with reliability and risk often important factors for farmers accustomed to the  predictability of agrochemicals (Griffiths et al 2008b). As such, it is an important  observation that minimum function was greater and more reliably achieved with a  species-rich assemblage compared with the more variable species-poor treatments,  without any compromise on the maximum function possible. Add to this the fact that the  most effective predator is likely to be pest-, crop- and context-dependent and this  creates a strong argument for retaining or augmenting a diversity of natural enemies for  optimum pest control function.     Overall Implications of the Results   Overall, our results suggest that progress is required on several fronts before the IPM  technologies studied here can be considered as an effective substitute to insecticide  use in cereals. Significant technical barriers remain and much remains to be done in the  development of non species specific, IPM.     The last serious outbreak of cereal aphids in summer in the UK was in the 1970’s  although these aphids are still a target of much insecticide use in the UK. During this  project natural infestation levels were low. It is possible that CBC, generated by AES measures, may have contributed to the decline in cereal aphid populations in the UK  although other factors such as changes in rotation, nitrogen fertiliser use, insecticide  usage, cultivars and climate have also played a role.     The efficacy of semiochemicals in some of the field trials conducted here was  inconclusive because of the low infestation levels. However, in the pea crop there were  significant effects and there were promising indications that the wheat variety ‘Solstice’  responds well to cis-jasmone treatment. The potential for semiochemicals thus requires  further evaluation in other crop systems, especially in the horticultural systems where  fewer insecticide products will be available due to pesticide revocations. However,  speed of action may limit adoption where cosmetic damage is important. Combining  CBC and semiochemicals may help to overcome the limitations of both approaches;  biocontrol has frequently been demonstrated to be more effective adjacent to field  boundaries, but issues regarding the scale of habitat augmentation and the ability of  habitats to provide sufficient natural enemies to have an impact need to be addressed.  While the literature is full of references to and definitions of IPM which recognise the  need for inclusion of a large and diverse range of component technologies, little is  known about how these technologies interact.     As for economic barriers to the commercial use of IPM, we have found that policy, as  implemented in the UK following the commencement of this research, has made what  appears to be a significant breakthrough in what is implemented on farms. We had  expected to find that farmers would be reluctant to consider IPM, and that practices  which can promote biological control functions would not be found on farms. Reasons  for this expectation were; 1. that farmers would capture only a small proportion of the  benefits of a change in technology and that they would face large transition costs, 2.  insecticides are cheap, to use, and pest control represents a very small proportion of  crop production costs, 3. the effectiveness of alternatives had not demonstrated.     However, AES implementation appears to have made a first step toward breaking  farmers’ dependence on pesticides by compensating them for revenue forgone or cost  incurred in the implementation of IPM beneficial land use change. Some of these  changes have, in certain combinations yielded measureable reductions in insecticide  use. Laboratory studies conducted here demonstrated significant complementarity  between natural enemy species shown in improved control and resilience. Further, field  scale trials showed that aphid control could be improved with habitat manipulation and  therefore, there remains scope to improve CBC in practice. AES is now in place to  provide such habitat improvement but these programmes do need to be developed  further to fully exploit these gains.    This research award has yielded several significant breakthroughs in our understanding  of the functioning of both CBC and semiochemical technologies. Among these is the  improved understanding of the relationship between beneficial species diversity,  abundance and pest control, which together with our improved understanding of the  field-scale habitats likely to promote these populations, will help us make significant  improvements to the UKs’ AES programmes.

Future Research Priorities  Social Science and Interdisciplinarity  Beyond the work that is planned to continue using both the farmer survey data, there  remains scope for further research in three directions. First, more detailed research,  using farmer interviews and matched case studies of farm practice, landscape backdrop  and background ecology would yield a more detailed picture of the determinants, and  patterns, of AES engagement. Secondly, access to “precision farming” GPS data  overlayed by ground cover mapping data should be pursued to allow the investigation  of both the positive and negative impacts of out-of-field habitat on farm productivity  using spatial econometric techniques. These efforts would help us to design in IPM  incentive compatibility into AES.  Thirdly, ongoing work making use of the  interdisciplinary researcher interviews to date suggests that further effort to assess the  effect of researcher engagement on interdisciplinary projects could be valuable. A similar investigation of ex-post researcher expectation and understanding of complex  problems, could be considered within the team.    Natural Science  Research has robustly identified many patterns and mechanisms underlying the  relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem services. It is now essential to  understand the context-dependence behind these mechanisms within field systems.    The field scale studies demonstrated that effective aphid biocontrol operates in cereal  crops and is influenced by the surrounding uncropped landscapes. Such studies need  to be extended to other pests and crops if a fully integrated approach is to be  developed. The ecology of key pest natural enemies needs further investigation to  enable the design of habitats that maximise biocontrol through optimimum resource  provision. Their use in conjunction with semiochemicals requires evaluation.     The semiochemical trials showed some promise even though cereal aphid populations  were low. Breeding crop plants to respond better to natural plant activators is expected  to enhance CBC given the differences between wheat varieties seen here. Other pest  targets should be sought for future work and new semiochemical treatments in addition  to cis-jasmone need to be developed as a matter of urgency given the increasing  demand for alternatives to toxic insecticides and ongoing need to protect crops from  pests.    Overall, the team recognises a pressing need to widen this research beyond the pest  problem considered here. While cereal aphids remain a target for pesticides in the UK,  they are by no means the most important cereal pest. In order to achieve high levels of  adoption, and to gain the further from pesticide deduction, IPM systems which can  control a wider range of pests must be devised.    References:    ADAS. (2002).

Data were collected over a 1-year period (Nov 2018–Nov 2019) from a wild population of rodents in a 4 ha (200 x 200 meters square) mixed woodland plot at Holly Hill, Wytham Woods, Oxford UK (Figure 1). Data for this study was collected as part of a longer-term rodent capture-mark-recapture study, where several rodent species were caught (Apodemus sylvaticus, Apodemus flavicollis and Myodes glareolus). Trapping was performed every 2-4 weeks, using 200 small folding Sherman traps (5.1 x 6.4 x 16.5cm, H. B Sherman). To ensure even trapping coverage, live traps were set with an alternating checkerboard design in every other 10 x 10 meter “Grid cell” of the 200 x 200 meters study area. Traps baited with 6 peanuts, a slice of apple and sterile cotton wool for bedding were set at dusk and collected at dawn, with all animals processed, sampled and then released inside the 100m2 grid cell they were captured in. As part of processing, captured individuals were identified to species, sexed, weighed, and aged (to juvenile or adult) based on size and pelage characteristics. At first capture, all individuals were injected subcutaneously with a passive integrated transponder tag (PIT-tag) for permanent identification. There were a few cases (~2% of captures) where the animal died during trapping and thus was not released. This was most often due to animal being found dead in the trap (which can happen due to epidemics or other poor health especially in the spring) and in a couple of cases due to animal being put down following Schedule 1 due to extreme poor health or injury. Faecal samples for gut microbiota analysis were collected from the trap and frozen at -80oC within 8 hours of collection. Utensils used for faecal pellet collection (e.g. tweezers) were sterilized using 70% ethanol between each sample processed, and all traps showing evidence of rodent contact were washed in strong bleach solution between trapping sessions.

Somerfordmethods.docx The data files present the results of a grazing experiment conducted in a restored floodplain meadow bordering the Thames upstream of Oxford.   Collection methods The data list all the species of plant recorded within individual 1 m x 1 m quadrats located within Somerford Mead, a floodplain meadow in the parish of Wytham on the River Thames, together with an estimate of the relative abundance for each species.  The data were collected in June of the year given in the filename.  The data (1987-2013) were collected either by the lead investigator, Dr Alison McDonald, or by student helpers (often from the University of Wageningen, NL) who had been inducted by Dr. McDonald.     The meadow was cut for hay in July each year and then from August 1991, one of three treatments were applied: Cattle Grazing Sheep grazing No grazing Each treatment was replicated three times, giving a total of 9 plots.  Each plat was sampled using ten quadrats giving a total of 90 quadrats.  The ten quadrat locations within each plot were located according to Fig 1 below.  The plots were permanently marked with metal pegs, so the time series of results were from permanent locations. There are three variants of the file format:  1987-1989 (incl.):  Baseline data collected from the field site before the imposition of the treatments.  The abundance estimate is based on the number of times the named species was recorded across 16 equally sized cells within the quadrat.  Scale is 1 – 16  1991-2013 (incl., but excl. 2000):  Response data to the three treatments applied. The abundance estimate is based on the number of times the named species was recorded across 16 equally sized cells within the quadrat.  Scale is 1 – 16  2014:  Final survey undertaken by UKCEH.  The abundance estimate is based on the projected area covered by the named species expressed as a percentage.  In all cases the number of species within each quadrat is given in the final column of the table.   Details of the method have been published in McDonald, 2001.  Nature and Units of recorded values 1997-2013 the unit of abundance is on a scale 1 -16 reflecting the number of cells in which the named species was found. 2014: the unit of abundance is on a scale 1 -100 reflecting the percentage of he ground area covered by the named species  Quality control Due to a number of taxonomic changes during the time course of the experiment, all names were checked in 2022 and updated according to Stace’s New flora of the British Isles (fourth edition, 2019) to avoid use of synonyms.   The species count for each quadrat was checked by Dr. M.J. Stone and any arithmetical errors corrected. The raw data were collected by a number of recorders, but all data were quality assured annually by either Dr A. McDonald in 1987-2013 or J.O. Mountford in 2014.   Details of data structure Each file presents a table of data in which the column headings give the species names and the rows correspond to individual quadrats, named in the first column.  The values in the table represent the abundance of the named species in the named quadrat.  IF the species was not recorded in a given quadrat then the cell is left blank. The final column has a value corresponding to the total number of species identified in each quadrat.   Experimental design/Sampling regime Each plot in Map 1 has a piece of steel scaffolding pole buried at its centre.  The NGR co-ordinates for which are given in Table 1. When species abundance was estimated by dividing the quadrat into 16 equal cells and then counting the number of cells (0.25 x 0.25 m) in which it occurs (1991-2013), the quadrat was divided using the schema presented in Figure 2.  The detail of species occurrence in individual cells was recorded on paper proformas in the field, but for the database only the number of cells where it was present is recorded. The original paper proformers are held by the Floodplain Meadows Partnership (floodplain-meadows-project@open.ac.uk ),  Table 1.  Coordinates of the plot centres.      Map 1.

Contents About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.  The UKBMS is indebted to all volunteers who contribute data to the scheme. In the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS), annual data on the population status of butterflies is derived from a wide-scale program of site-based monitoring. The sampling framework comprises: (1) butterfly transects in sites selected by recorders, monitored weekly up to 26 times per year (Pollard walks1); (2) butterfly transects from a stratified-random selection of 1km square, monitored 2-3 times per year; (3) targeted surveys using other methods targeted at specific species. The resulting UKBMS dataset is an important resource for understanding changes in insect populations and answering policy questions relating to status and trends in biodiversity. The scheme has monitored changes in the abundance of butterflies throughout the United Kingdom since 1976, and currently has over 2500 actively recorded sites each year.  Data from all sampling methods are analysed together. An overview of the different components is given below, but for further details please visit the UKBMS website: http://www.ukbms.org/. Standard butterfly transects (traditional transects/Pollard walks1):  A fixed-route line transect is established at a site chosen by the recorder, and all butterflies are recorded along the route on a regular basis.  Transects are typically 2-4 km long, taking between 45 minutes and two hours to walk, and are divided into sections corresponding to different habitat or management units. The number of all species of butterfly are recorded in a fixed width band (typically 5m wide) along the transect each week from the beginning of April until the end of September yielding, ideally, 26 counts per year. Surveys take place under specified weather conditions suitable for butterfly activity. Almost 2000 such sites are currently sampled each year. Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): The same transect methodology is used as for Pollard walks, including recording of all butterfly species along the transect. The WCBS comprises stratified-random sample locations (1km squares), with the transect route being set as two parallel 1-km long transects subdivided into 10 sections. Only 2-3 visits are required compared to the 26 for standard transects, with a minimum of 2 visits in July/August but with spring visits also encouraged. The WCBS was established in 2009 survey to better sample common habitats such as farmland. The WCBS currently samples around 800 squares per year.  Targeted surveys: These comprise ‘Single-species transects’ and surveys using alternative methods. Single-species transects follow the same transect methodology described above but only record specific species, and only on a few weeks throughout the main flight period of that focal species.  Alternative methods also focus on single species, but do not use the transect methodology. ‘Timed counts’ involve recording the abundance of adults of a particular species over a set period of time and within a set area during suitable weather conditions.  Egg and larval web counts involve recording the number of eggs or larval webs of a species (e.g. Marsh Fritillary) from a given area of suitable habitat. 1Pollard, E. & Yates, T.J. (1993). Monitoring Butterflies for Ecology and Conservation. Chapman and Hall, London. Nature of data collected and trend analysis The UKBMS relies on the creation of abundance indices, i.e. based on the number of individual butterflies recorded in transect sections and sites. These indices are a relative rather than an absolute measure of the size of a population. The site index reflects a more or less constant proportion of the number of butterflies present, although the proportion seen is likely to vary according to species; some butterfly species, such as Marbled White are conspicuous, whereas others such as Dingy Skipper are much less likely to be detected. Indices have been shown to relate closely to other, more intensive, measures of population size such as mark, release, recapture (MRR) methods1.  The method for combining site indices to produce overall indices for each butterfly species (‘collated indices’) involves applying the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method developed in 20162 with an additional modification that the data from each site in each year is weighted in the final stage relative to the proportion of the species flight period surveyed that year for that site. The method uses all butterfly counts in a season (from Pollard walks, reduced survey methods, and the WCBS) to estimate the seasonal pattern of butterfly counts for that year, and this is used to extrapolate from observed data to account for gaps in the recording. The weighting ensures that the observed data have a stronger effect upon the final indices than the extrapolated data.  1Pollard, E. & Yates, T.J. (1993). Monitoring Butterflies for Ecology and Conservation. Chapman and Hall, London. 2Dennis, E.B., Morgan, B.J.T,  Freeman, S.N., Brereton, T. & Roy, D.B. (2016) A Generalized Abundance Index for Seasonal Invertebrates. Biometrics (72): pp1305-1314 (DOI: 10.1111/ biom.12506). Quality control Data are recorded in the field on standard recording forms, then typically entered online by the recorder (or a regional co-ordinator) using the UKBMS data entry site (http://www.ukbms.org/mydata) or a bespoke software programme ‘Transect Walker’ before being uploaded to a database which holds all records. Automatic checks are applied within the online recording system and the Transect Walker program to alert recorders to potential data entry errors, e.g. abnormally high counts of a species or a record of species outside of its recognised flight period. The option is given to proceed with the record or to alter it appropriately.  Each site data belongs to a region for which a transect coordinator is responsible. The regional coordinator has good knowledge of the sites they receive records for and checks the records for any questionable records. Data entered online is also checked by the regional transect coordinators and can be done so continuously throughout the season. Following these preliminary validation checks, the data undergoes a series of further automated and manual validation procedures including queries to check for records of species that are: recorded out of their known distribution range (using data from Butterfly Conservation’s Butterflies for the New Millennium (BNM) and existing UKBMS data), recorded out of their normal flight period, recorded for the first time at a site, have atypically high abundances, or abundances that are markedly different to normal for a given site at a given time of year. Data entry errors are corrected through a set of bespoke queries and where necessary data queries are discussed with transect co-ordinators or individual transect recorders following which edits to the main UKBMS dataset are made accordingly.

This dramatically improves spatial and  thematic accuracy and better represents real world objects.    The GB framework is based on Ordnance Survey Master Map topography  layer (hereafter referred to as OSMM) and the NI framework is based on  cartographic data from Ordnance Survey Northern Ireland (now part of Land &  Property Services).   The spatial framework has been further refined by supplementing the  generalised national cartography with agricultural census data boundaries and  image segments.   LCM2007 is the first land cover map to provide continuous vector coverage of  UK Broad Habitats derived from satellite data.    LCM2007 contains almost 10 million land parcels (8.6 million for GB; 0.9  million for NI).   Heritage   LCM2007 is the third in the Land Cover Map (LCM) series:  o LCM1990 (originally called LCMGB) is the first GB map of land cover  produced from satellite data. It is a raster product with land cover given  as 25 bespoke target classes.  o LCM2000 is a vector land cover map of the UK based on satellite data.  Land parcels were derived from image segments.  Land cover is based  upon UK Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats.    Production   LCM2007 was produced from over seventy satellite images, which were  combined into 34 multi-date summer-winter images. The multi-date images  were based on one summer and one winter image. The summer-winter  images increase the contrast between land cover types and so increase the  accuracy of the classification.   o 91% of UK was mapped from summer-winter images (compared to  84% for LCM2000 and 87% for LCM1990)  o 9% was classified from single-date imagery (compared to 15% for  LCM2000 and 11% for LCM1990)  o 0.5% was filled manually   99.5% of parcels were classified using automated procedures.  0.5% were  classified by visual interpretation.   After initial classification, knowledge-based enhancements were applied to  increase the refinement and accuracy of the classification using soil, altitude  and urban extent data sets. 6    Quality Assurance   Field validation points were collected between 2006 and 2008. 9127 of the  field validation points were used to validate LCM2007 giving an overall  accuracy of 83% for the LCM2007 classes.   The accuracy for different land classes varies.  Comparison with Countryside Survey   LCM2007 has been assessed against a) the 591 Countryside Survey  squares, b) against the Countryside Survey estimates of Broad Habitat extent  for the UK.    The comparison of LCM2007 to the 591 1km x 1km squares surveyed by  Countryside Survey showed:  o 62% correspondence at the BH-level, 67% at the aggregate level and  76% at the associated BH-level.  o For the common Broad Habitats (defined here as those covering more  than 10,000km2 of the UK) the User‟s accuracy varies from 89% for  „Built-up Areas and Gardens‟ to 37% for „Dwarf, Shrub Heath‟.    Countryside Survey has an established methodology for calculating National  Estimates of the area of each Broad Habitat for the UK from the CS-squares.  The CS in 2007 estimates of Broad Habitat were compared to the LCM2007  areas of BH for the UK:  o The LCM classes which fall within the Countryside Survey upper and  lower 95% confidence limits for the UK are: „Coniferous Woodland‟,  Freshwater, „Built-up Areas and Gardens‟ and „Calcareous Grassland‟,  Broadleaved Woodland, „Acid Grassland‟ and „Inland Rock‟.  Summary statistics   LCM2007 shows the UK land cover as being comprised of mainly „Arable and  Horticulture‟ and „Improved Grassland‟ (25% each), with the other main land  covers being Semi-natural grassland (13%) and Mountain, Heath and Bog  (16%). Urban areas make-up 6% of the UK, as do „Coniferous Woodland‟  (6%) and Broadleaved woodland (6%), with coastal classes and  Freshwater contributing the remaining 2%.  Change mapping   Using CEH land cover products for change mapping is complex because:  o The classes used in the 1990 map differ from the two later LCMs.  o The spatial structure differs across all three LCMs.  o Classified images typically have an error of around 20%, whereas the  level of BH change is likely to be less than this in the period between  LCMs.   o Reliable methods for separating real changes from those due to error  and spatial inconsistency have not yet been established. 7    Product specification   LCM2007 maps 23 land cover classes, which combine to map 17 terrestrial  Broad Habitats.   LCM2007 maps land cover, rather than land use.   LCM2007 has a minimum mappable unit of 0.5ha.   LCM2007 has a rich metadata to enable users to track the processing steps  applied to each polygon.  LCM2007 data products   The main LCM2007 product is the vector data set, which has 10 attributes  that document the processing stages applied to the polygon, including the  polygon construction (Construct attribute), spectral classification result  (ProbList attribute) and knowledge-based enhancements (KBE attribute).   The main raster data set is a 25m product containing the 23 LCM2007 land  cover classes.    LCM2007 is also summarised as a series of 1km data products, which give  percentage cover or dominant land cover for each 1km square. The 1km  products are produced for the 23 LCM2007 land cover classes and for the 10  LCM2007 Aggregate classes.  Providing a scientific evidence base   LCM2007 will be a key component in developing multi-tiered approaches to  habitat monitoring and informing evidence-based policy.   LCM2007 will help to inform environmental policy in many areas including:  biodiversity, ecosystem services, landscape planning, habitat connectivity and  catchment management.   Used with other data, LCM2007 will have applications in many other sectors.  Accessing LCM2007 data sets   The LCM2007 1km raster data sets are available via the CEH Information  Gateway [https://gateway.ceh.ac.uk]     The full vector product and 25m product are available under licence on  request from CEH.

Examples include  artificial materials such as roads and buildings in urban areas, natural and managed  vegetated surfaces and inland water.  Land cover maps have multiple uses. They  are used for the management of natural resources, urban planning, carbon  accounting and flood risk modelling, to name only a few.  Land cover maps can be  obtained by ground-based surveys but for large surface areas this would be  impractical and too expensive.  To realise cost effective large-scale land cover maps,  satellite images are used. This document describes the production of the Land Cover  Map for 2007 (LCM2007).  LCM2007 is the third digital Land Cover Map produced by  CEH from satellite images. It gives land cover in relation to UK Biodiversity Action  Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats. The UK BAP is the UK Governments response to the  Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) arising from the Earth Summit in Rio 1992.   The complete UK coverage of LCM2007 complements the intensive sampling, but  restricted spatial coverage of the Countryside Survey of 2007. CS is a unique study  of the natural resources of the UK‟s countryside which involves ground-based  mapping and assessment of associated vegetation, soils and freshwaters.     Three National Land Cover Maps  The first digital land cover map for Great Britain derived from satellite imagery is the  Land Cover Map of Great Britain 1990 (LCM1990, formerly LCMGB 1990).  This is a  25m x 25m pixel land cover product describing land cover in 1990.  LCM1990 pre- dates the CBD so land cover is given as 25 bespoke target classes.  It was produced  by automated classification techniques where each pixel is assigned to a land cover  class based upon its spectral characteristics.    The Land Cover Map for 2000 (LCM2000) is the second map in the series and  includes Northern Ireland.  The production of LCM2000 used novel object based  image analysis (OBIA) techniques that had recently emerged from geographical  information science.  Instead of representing the land surface as regular sized pixels,  OBIA considers the land surface a collection of discrete irregular objects such as  forests, lakes, urban areas and fields.  Partitioning an image into objects is  analogous to the way humans conceptually organise the landscape in order to  understand it and the contextual relationships between objects assist with their  classification.  It is widely accepted that OBIA produces thematic land cover maps  with more accuracy than pixel based approaches (Gao and Mas 2008).  Land cover objects for LCM2000 were derived from image segments (see Section  3.3) and were assigned land cover values according to the pixel distributions within.   These classifications where then refined using contextual and ancillary information.   LCM2007 builds upon the successes of LCM2000 and employs similar but enhanced  classification techniques.  The principal difference between LCM2007 and LCM2000  is the source of land cover objects.  LCM2007 objects come from generalised digital  cartography, refined with image segments.  LCM2000 uses only image segments.   Deriving objects from digital cartography is advantageous.  Cartographic boundaries 9    very accurately delineate real-world land cover objects (e.g. lakes, fields,  settlements, industrial areas, semi-natural areas etc) and this improves the spatial  accuracy of LCM2007 over LCM2000.  Moreover, the accurate delineation of real- world objects helps to clarify the spectral properties of the land surface and therefore  improves thematic accuracy too.  The other major advantage that comes from using national cartography relates to re- usability and change detection.  Image segments represent a snapshot of land  surface reflectance.  Reflectance varies temporally.  A segmentation performed in  one year will therefore give a different result to the next or previous years.  The  consequence of this is that successive land cover maps based on image segments  will have very different spatial structures.  This restricts spatial and temporal  comparisons of land cover and therefore the ability to detect change.  By using  digital cartography LCM2007 overcomes this problem.  Many of the boundaries  mapped in the UK countryside come from or pre-date the enclosure acts of the  1700s and 1800s.  They are relatively static through time when compared to  changes in land use and land cover.  This relative fixation of land cover objects, the  principal units of change, makes the generalised cartography of LCM2007 re-usable.   Successive land cover maps that share a common spatial structure will make  accurate and spatially explicit change detection a realistic ambition.   Therefore in  addition to providing up-to-date information on land cover, because of its spatial  structure LCM2007 gives us a platform for future UK wide land surface mapping and  monitoring exercises.                                                  Please note: The UK component of the Corine Land Cover 2006 produced on behalf of the  European Environment Agency, has been derived from the LCM2007 vector product by a  process involving geometric generalisation and thematic transformations. 10    Chapter 2: LCM2007 Classification Scheme    Background  The UK Biodiversity Group identified a group of Broad Habitats to cover the  complete range of UK habitats, as an initial stage in the development of the UK  Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP). The Broad Habitats are described by the Joint Nature  Conservancy Committee (JNCC) (Jackson, 2000) and are used by Countryside  Survey and LCMs 2000 and 2007. LCM2007 aimed to contribute to the habitat  assessment by mapping the UKs Broad Habitats.            LCM2007 classes  LCM2007 classifies the land cover of the UK using classes based on the Broad  Habitats, with some minor differences. Table 2.1 summarises the LCM2007 classes  and notes their correspondence with the Broad Habitat classification scheme and  also with LCM2000. A summary of the Broad Habitats is given in Appendix 1.     Spectral remote sensing can be used to classify land cover, however, the  relationship between land cover and habitat is not straightforward.  Sometimes land  cover and habitat type have a direct and unique match. An example of a unique,  direct match would be a patch of coniferous trees, which would map directly to the  „Coniferous Woodland‟ Broad Habitat.  In some cases the links between land cover  and Broad Habitat are more complicated and exhibit a „one-to-many‟ relationship.  This is particularly true of grassland, which forms the „Improved Grassland‟, „Neutral  Grassland‟, „Acid Grassland‟ and „Calcareous Grassland‟ habitats plus some types of  „Bog‟ habitats. Grassland is also present, although not as the dominant land cover, in  „Built-up Areas and Gardens‟, „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟ and Saltmarsh, which falls  into the „Littoral sediment‟ category. Consequently, assigning grassland to different  habitat types is not straightforward.    In the production of LCM2007 grassland is mapped by classifying images into  „Improved Grassland‟ and Rough grassland, after which knowledge-based  enhancement (KBE) rules are applied. The knowledge-based enhancement rules  determine whether Rough grassland should be reclassified as „Neutral Grassland‟,  „Calcareous Grassland‟ or „Acid Grassland, or whether it should remain as Rough  grassland (for details about KBEs see Section 3.7). The requirement for KBEs to  separate Rough grassland into grassland Broad Habitats is important because  grassland Broad Habitats, in the field, may be determined by the presence of a few  indicator species rather than the dominant species. The determination between  grassland Broad Habitats in LCM2007 is based on soil type, as shown by soil data  sets, and consequently does not always reach the same conclusion as field survey.  The semi-natural grasslands in LCM2007 therefore differ from the strict Broad  Habitat interpretation, as they are partly based on soil data sets, rather than species  composition (this is discussed further in Chapter 4). In Table 2.1 Neutral, Acid and   A consistent formatting style will be used when referring to Broad Habitats, LCM2007 classes and  LCM2007 aggregate classes. For Broad Habitats the convention is: italics, a capital letter at the  start of words and enclose in single speech-marks e.g. „Improved Grassland‟. LCM2007 classes  are given in bold e.g. Freshwater, as are LCM2007 Aggregate classes. 11    Table 2.1. Summary of LCM2007 classes and Broad Habitat. Green shading highlights Broad  Habitats as documented by JNCC (Jackson, 2000).     Broad Habitat  LCM2007 class  Notes on LCM2007 class  „Broadleaved, Mixed  and Yew Woodland‟  Broadleaved woodland  Same as LCM2000 class.

Bracken is a Broad Habitat under certain  circumstances (see Appendix 1). Bracken  can be mapped using LCM2007 methods, but  it depends on image timing, so for  consistency it is assigned to „Acid Grassland‟.  „Fen, Marsh and  Swamp‟  „Fen, Marsh and  Swamp‟  As BH and LCM2000  „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟  Heather  As LCM2000; spectral differences between  dense heather and heather grassland enable  separation spectrally.

Urban 12    Calcareous Grassland are identified as being „BH and LCM2007‟ as the aim is to  map to the specific grassland Broad Habitat type as far as possible.    The montane distribution for LCM2007 is assigned based on altitude (see Section  3.7), whereas the Broad Habitat definition is based on vegetation type. The Broad  Habitat definitions produced by JNCC note (Jackson, 2000) that if other habitats,  such as „Calcareous Grassland‟ and „Bog‟, occur within the „Montane Habitats‟ zone  they should not be recorded as „Montane Habitats‟. In the production of LCM2007 it  was not possible to determine whether a „Montane Habitats‟ reclassification based  on altitude has greater validity than the original spectral classification. Consequently,  in LCM2007 above the montane altitude LCM2007 maps three Broad habitats:  „Montane Habitats‟, Freshwater and „Inland Rock‟.     Steps such as the application of knowledge-based enhancements to identify the  different semi-natural grassland types and the „Montane Habitats‟ areas are  documented within the polygon attributes of the vector data set. Consequently, if a  user wishes to remove a particular knowledge-based enhancement, either to retrieve  a merged class such as Bracken, or to remove the „Montane Habitats‟ altitude-based  correction, then they can. This is because the original spectral classification  associated with each polygon remains and is documented in the ProbList attribute of  the vector data set (see Table 5.1 for more details).    There are a number of habitats where it may not be readily apparent how they are  categorised in the JNCC descriptions (Jackson, 2000), including:    Machair which is a Priority Habitat that goes into the „Supra-littoral Sediment‟  category, rather than the „Calcareous Grassland‟ Broad Habitat (Jackson,  2000, Annex 1: Table 3a http://www.jncc.gov.uk/page-2433-theme=default).   Urban despoiled land cover types, such as quarries and peat extraction, fall  into the „Inland Rock‟, rather than the „Built-up Areas and Gardens‟ Broad  Habitat, in the JNCC Broad Habitat definitions.    LCM2007 Aggregate classes  Not all applications need the thematic resolution of the complete set of LCM2007  classes, so LCM2007 has a defined set of Aggregate classes, based on merging  LCM2007 classes (Table 2.2). The Aggregate classes are used for the 1km raster  products and for data analysis and presentation in Chapters 4 and 5.    LCM2007- the new Land Cover Map  The classes described in Table 2.1 were used to classify the UK and produced the  map shown in Figure 2.1. A full overview of Land Cover Map 2007 can be seen in  Figure 2.1.  The distribution of the main Broad Habitats can be clearly identified; for  example, the arable land in the eastern part of Great Britain, improved grassland in  western England, Wales and Northern Ireland, coniferous plantations in the Scottish  Borders and the domination of the north west of Scotland with bog, heather and acid  grassland habitats.  The larger urban areas are also clearly identifiable, as are the  Montane regions in Scotland and Loch Neagh in Northern Ireland. 13    Table 2.2 Relationship between Aggregate classes, Broad Habitat and LCM2007 classes.

AWIFS, with a pixel size of 60m, was used when  other imagery was unavailable. To minimise data volume, but retain spectral  information, the red, NIR and MIR bands from the summer and winter images were  combined to create 6-band 2-date summer-winter composite images (from here on  referred to as composites, see Fuller & Parsell, 1990). Once classified the images  produce a patchwork of land cover scenes which cover the UK (Figure 3.1).        Figure 3.1. A mosaic of the classified images used to produce full UK coverage for LCM2007.  Different colours show the coverage of the different composite and single-date images (for  image details see Appendices 3 and 2). © NERC (CEH) 2011. © Contains Ordnance Survey data ©  Crown Copyright 2009.       Ideally, the entire UK would be classified using composite images, however cloud- cover and the number of image acquisitions by the relevant satellites limit the  amount of data available. For LCM2007 91% of the UK was classified using  composite images (Table 3.1), which compares with 84% for LCM2000 and 87% for 16    GB1990. Where composite images are not available summer-only or winter-only  images were used, although they typically have a reduced ability to distinguish  between habitats. Figure 3.2 shows the distribution of composite and single-date  imagery for LCM2000 (Fig. 3.2a) and LCM2007 (Fig. 3.2b). Single-date imagery was  most widely used in Scotland and Northern Ireland for both LCM2000 and LCM2007,  because cloud limited the availability of data (Fig. 3.2). The data classified for  LCM2007 cover less than three years ranging from 02/09/2005 to 18/07/2008 (see  Appendix 1 for further details) compared to over four years for LCM2000 (Fuller et  al., 2002) and GB1990 (Fuller et al., 1994).

Contributions of composite (combined summer and winter imagery) and single-date (summer-only or winter-only) data sets for:   a) LCM2000 and b) LCM2007. Note, GB1990 was only used for hole-filling LCM2000; gaps in LCM2007 were filled manually (for details see ‘Hole- filling’ in Section 3.6 Image Classification). 18              Figure 3.3. Timing of summer and winter images used in LCM2007 composites.    Figure 3.3 shows the timing of the winter and summer images. Winter images are  defined as those falling between October and the end of April (through to mid-May  for northern Scotland), whilst summer images are considered to be mid-May through  to late July (into August for northern Scotland) (Fuller et al., 1994). These seasonal  targets aim to capture the extremes of the phenological cycle from winter- senescence to the main growing season before harvest. For accurate classification it  is desirable to have a winter image followed by a summer image, so that the images  are from the same crop cycle.     LCM2007 is based on a target year of 2007, although other images are required.  The target year of 2007 means that the preferred combination would be winter  2006/07 images (green section of Fig. 3.3a) combined with summer 2007 images  (green section of Fig. 3.3b), but whilst a high proportion of the winter images are  from the winter of 2006/07 only a small proportion of summer images were available  for 2007 (Figure 3.3). Therefore, only three composites, covering 6% of the UK, met  the preferred winter-summer combination (Table 3.1). Thirteen other composites  were from the same crop cycle, but were not in 2007 the preferred year. However,  52% of the UK was mapped by composites including at least one image from 2007,  with a further 4% of the UK mapped from single-date images from 2007 (Figure 3.4).  Of the remaining composites, in 20 the summer image precedes the winter image,  and in the remaining four the winter image preceded the summer image by 18+   a) Timing of winter images  b) Timing of summer images 19          Figure 3.4. Areas classified using 2007 images.    months. In a very small number of cases it was necessary to manually classify small  areas of Landsat7-ETM+ data (see Hole-filling description in Section 3.6).     The sensors available for land cover mapping at the 20-30m pixel size have changed  between the production dates of the three land cover maps.  GB1990 was based  entirely on Landsat-TM, whereas LCM2000 used Landsat-ETM, Landsat-TM, and  LISS. For LCM2007 the available sensors were, in order of preference, Landsat-TM,  LISS-3, SPOT-4/5, and AWIFS. Landsat-ETM7 data were available, but due to  sensor damage in 2003, the images were not suitable for supervised classification. A  breakdown of the composites by sensor shows that the bulk of the imagery used to  produce LCM2007 is from Landsat-TM5 and LISS-3 (Table 3.2). The key advantage  of using a range of satellites is the increased likelihood of good-quality cloud-free  images. The disadvantages include slightly varying processing methods for different 20    sensors, plus the swathes of the sensors vary, so images from different sensors  generally have much less overlap than images from the same sensor.

Two CEH data sets were used, the first  being a set of ground reference points collected by CEH between 2006 and 2008  specifically for the purposes of training and validating LCM2007. The second CEH  data set was the Countryside Survey Broad Habitat areas data set, surveyed in  2007. The external data sets included national cartographic products for GB and NI,  the Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) needed for the altitude-based corrections and  various soil data sets.      CEH produced data sets - Ground reference points  A series of field trips were undertaken to collect a set of ground reference points for  the purposes of training and validating the land cover classifications. The majority of  the field trips took place in 2007, as this was the target summer for LCM2007 image  acquisitions. The ground reference points were collected using a tablet PC-based  Digital Data collection system developed for CS in 2007. The tablet was connected  to a GPS and had a bespoke GIS package which was automatically updated with the  tablet/car location, enabling users to easily record land cover at points along the field  trip routes (Figure 3.5). Data on LCM2007 land cover classes (as listed in Table 2.1)  and location were visually identified and recorded from a vehicle as it travelled along  the routes shown in Figure 3.6. Some points were recorded on foot and from view- points when vehicular access was not possible. The ground reference points were  distributed widely across the UK and routes were carefully selected to visit rarer land  cover types. 21            Figure 3.5.

Countryside Survey in 2007 data  The Countryside Survey Broad Habitat data collected by CEH in 2007 were used to  compare between CS in 2007 and LCM2007 (Chapter 4). Countryside Survey is a  unique study of the natural resources of the UK‟s countryside and has been carried  out in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1998 and 2007. Countryside Survey uses a stratified  sampling approach which samples one-kilometre squares randomly located within  different Institute of Terrestrial Ecology (ITE) Land Classes (Bunce et al., 1996). The  stratification by ITE Land Class ensures that survey squares are distributed across  all landscape types found in the UK, with each stratum having similar environmental  characteristics such as climate and geology.  In 2007 the field survey covered a total  of 591 1km sample squares spread across England, Scotland and Wales. Areas of  habitat were mapped within each square and more detailed samples were made of 23    vegetation in a series of plots. The full data set collected in Countryside Survey  enables national estimates of: the area and the change in area of habitats; the  changing condition of vegetation; the changing condition of soils, freshwaters and  ponds. However, for the purposes of comparison with LCM2007 the key aspect of  the data is the Broad Habitat map of each 1km square.    External datasets (excluding satellite imagery)  Non-CEH data sets were needed to create the spatial framework, inform the  knowledge-based enhancements (KBE) (see Section 3.7 for full details) and, in the  case of the DEM data set, as input into the raster pre-processing stages. The  external data sets used in the production of LCM2007 are summarised in Table 3.3  (the situation was complicated by slightly different products being available for the  different countries of the UK).

In total it contains over 400 million individual features.  These data  were used to produce the spatial framework for GB.      Land & Property Services (LPS) is the mapping agency for Northern Ireland. It was  formed by a merger between Ordnance Survey Northern Ireland (OSNI) and Land  Registry for Northern Ireland. LPS‟s Large-scale Vector database is a topographic  coverage of Northern Ireland comprised of over 500 individual tiles with map features  represented as points, lines and polygons.  LPS Large-scale Vector was used to  produce the spatial framework for Northern Ireland.    The OSMM and LPS (OSNI) datasets are discussed in more detail in Sections 3.3  and 3.4 respectively.    Agricultural census boundaries  Agricultural agencies in devolved governments maintain up-to-date digital maps of  agricultural land, along with woodland and marginal land on which grants or  subsidies can be claimed (Table 3.3).  These data contain boundaries that are often  too new to have been incorporated into UK inventories maintained by the OS and  LPS, or where no physical boundary exists for these agencies to map but where  fields have been subdivided for distinct agricultural use.  Incorporating these  boundaries into the framework of LCM2007 improves the delineation of land use and  therefore helps to clarify spectral properties of the land surface (see Section 3.3)  leading to more accurate land cover classification.    Urban areas  Urban area outlines for larger urban areas in England and Wales were provided by  the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The urban area and settlement boundary  dataset was created as part of the 2001 Census (ONS, 2004). For Scotland, the  Urban-Rural Classification 2003-2004 was provided by the Scottish Government. For  Northern Ireland, the Statistical Classification and Delineation of Settlements of 2005  was provided by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA).  Additionally, for Northern Ireland some urban areas were manually digitised using  satellite imagery data.      Soils  For England and Wales, Soilscapes (at 1:250,000) was provided by Cranfield  University (NSRI). The Agri-Food and Bioscience Institute provided a bespoke  Soilscape-like product for Northern Ireland (Jordan & Higgins, 2009). The soils  information for Scotland came from a bespoke product derived by the Macaulay  Land Use Research Institute (now the James Hutton Institute) from 1:250,000 soil  maps and the Land Cover of Scotland (LCS88) dataset. 25    Digital Elevation Model  NEXTMap Britain is a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for Great Britain created by  Intermap Technologies Inc. based on airborne radar data collected during 2002 and  2003.     3.3 Development of spatial frameworks: Great Britain  The spatial framework aims to delineate roughly homogenous groups of pixels  (spectral regions) and in doing so optimise the application of the maximum likelihood  classifier.  The LCM2007 spatial framework for Great Britain is based on the OS  MasterMap topography layer (OSMM). The topography layer contains over 450  million individual features representing real-world objects such as fields, roads,  buildings (polygons), overhead power lines, overhead phone lines (lines), letter  boxes, phone boxes (points) as well as intangible objects such as administrative  boundaries.   LCM2007 uses only the real-world polygon objects.  There are over  100 million real-world polygons and these give complete and continuous coverage of  Great Britain.  Minimum Mappable Unit and Minimum Feature Width  OSMM is highly detailed and accurate.  Urban areas and rural towns have been  surveyed to 1.0m accuracy against the British National Grid.  Rural areas have been  surveyed to 2.5m accuracy. Consequently, OSMM contains millions of polygons with  an extent of just a few square metres.  Contrast this with the 20m x 20m spatial  resolution of resampled satellite data used for LCM2007 (Figure 3.7).  The maximum  likelihood object-based spectral classification (Section 3.6) uses the average spectral  response within a land parcel to assign a land cover class.  A minimum of 4 whole  pixels is required to achieve a reliable spectral signature, so clearly there is far too  much detail in the OSMM.  This is especially evident in urban areas where a single  pixel may cover many real-world objects. A land parcel specification with a minimum  mappable unit (MMU) of 0.5ha and minimum feature width (MFW) of 20m was  specified for LCM2007.  This is considered the maximum spatial resolution of land  cover that can be achieved from 20m x 20m pixel satellite data.    Generalisation of OS MasterMap topography layer    Spatial generalisation is a process in which unnecessary detail is removed but  relevant detail is retained.  OSMM was generalised to satisfy the MMU and MFW  required for LCM2007.  The generalisation involved a series of iterative steps each  simplifying the spatial structure by selectively splitting and merging polygons. This  process terminated when the rate of simplification relative to the cost of further  processing diminished beyond a critical value.  Because of the huge volume of data  the generalisation of OSMM was computationally intense and required bespoke  software written for a 200 node computer-cluster.  The density of polygons was  reduced to less than 6% of the original. 26          Figure 3.7. OS MasterMap topography layer spatial structure against 20m x 20m satellite data.  © NERC (CEH) 2011. © Crown Copyright 2007, Ordnance Survey Licence Number 100017572.         Splitting and Merging     Splitting and merging represents the core of the spatial generalisation. To support  splitting and merging polygons were colour coded according to geometric complexity  (Figure 3.8).  Red polygons are too small (less than the MMU); cyan are too small  and too narrow (smaller than the MMU and narrower than the MFW); blue satisfy the  parcel criteria for LCM2007 but are elongated; yellow satisfy parcel criteria but have  complex boundaries; green polygons represent the ideal, they are broad and have  simple boundaries. The objective of the spatial generalisation is to maximise the  number of green polygons and eliminate all red and cyan polygons.  Blue and yellow  polygons are acceptable but are simplified when possible.  The splitting process begins by buffering inwards by 10m.  This removes the narrow  features of a polygon.  Buffering out from this simplified polygon by 20m creates a  „cookie-cutter‟, which is used to split the original (Figure 3.9a).  The resultant pieces  are then reclassified as red, cyan, yellow, blue or green (Figure 3.9b) ready for  merging.  Polygons that are too small or too thin are merged with their most  appropriate neighbour (Figure 3.9c). 27      Figure 3.8.  Colour classification of polygons based on area and perimeter relationships.  A is  the area, P is the perimeter.  Ar is the reduced area.  Reduced area is obtained by buffering  inwards by  .            Figure 3.9. Splitting and merging sequence.

A merge step (c) merges the fragments and simplifies  the spatial structure. © NERC (CEH) 2011. Crown Copyright 2007. Ordnance Survey Licence  number 100017572.      An objective when merging is to minimise the spectral heterogeneity in merged  parcels.  For example, it would be inappropriate to merge an urban parcel with an  adjacent lake.  The two objects will be spectrally distinct and mixed parcels classify  poorly.  To guide the merging process therefore attribute data associated to the  OSMM land parcels was used. The descriptiveGroup attribute assigns a land parcel  object to one of 21 groups; for example Path, Building, Natural Environment, and so  forth.  The descriptiveTerm refines this; for example descriptiveGroup = Natural  Environment, descriptiveTerm = Rough Grassland.  The make attribute specifies  whether a feature is man-made or natural.  Using this attribute information a concept  of spectral similarity was derived.   When merging, polygons were merged with those  most likely to have similar spectral characteristics.      A/P2 Area Ar Threshold A/P2 : area / perimeter  squared Ar : reduced area 28    A typical result of OSMM generalisation is given in Figure 3.10a and 3.10b.  Figure  3.10a shows the detail rich OSMM.  The generalised result in Figure 3.10b has  retained the salient features of the OSMM, but narrow and small features (such as  narrow roads, streams, tracks and farmsteads) that violate the MMU and MFW have  been removed.

Integration of agricultural boundaries  Generalised OSMM works very well in urban areas where changes in land cover are  invariably separated by some form of boundary mapped by OS.  In the agricultural  landscape the situation is sometimes less clear cut.  Pasture farming requires that  boundaries are stock proof and OSMM works well here.  It works less well in  extensively arable areas, where land cover boundaries are frequently missing.  The  missing boundaries generally relate to different farming practices being applied to  different parts of the same field where no physical boundary exists for the OS to  map.    To receive grants from government schemes UK farmers are required to map and  submit land parcels outlining the extent of different agricultural land use.  These data  are maintained by government agencies (Table 3.3) and were used for the second  stage of the spatial framework construction.  The data resolve many of the missing  boundary issues encountered in agricultural landscapes and were merged with the  OSMM spatial framework (Figure 3.10c).  This increases the number of objects in  the spatial framework (Table 3.4).  The extra objects account for some of the  variability not picked up by the OSMM and in doing so help to improve classification  results. 29    Integration of Image Segments  Within a field there may be spatial differences in fertility due to the effects of shading,  aspect, flooding, slope or uneven application of fertilizer leading to spectral variability  within a crop.  In semi-natural areas, for example in upland areas above land  enclosed for arable or pasture the heterogeneity of semi-natural vegetation will lead  to spectrally distinct regions than have not been mapped by the OS.  In these cases  the spatial framework derived from OSMM and agricultural boundary data is  insufficient to distinguish spectral regions.  Image segmentation refers to the partitioning of a digital image into multiple  segments.  A label is assigned to every pixel in an image such that pixels with the  same label share certain visual characteristics.  Clusters of pixels with the same  label identify relatively homogenous areas, image segments.  Image segments were  derived from satellite images (see Section 3.5).  The third and final stage of the  spatial framework construction involved the integration of these segments with the  land parcels derived from OSMM and agricultural boundary data.  The increase in  parcel density from this integration is given in Table 3.4.  Contrasting Figure 3.10c  with 3.10d gives a typical result of this third stage; clearly the segmentation has  delineated spectral regions not picked up by OSMM and agricultural boundary data.

LPS‟s Large-scale Vector digital database is a representation of  topographic and cartographic map features comprising lines, points and polygons.   The polygon coverage is restricted and represents a small percentage of Northern  Ireland's land surface.  It was therefore necessary to create a polygon coverage from  the LPS‟s Large-scale Vector line work.  The polygonisation process retains all lines  that enclose an area and dangling lines are discarded.  The enclosed areas become  the polygons.  Figure 3.11a shows a sample of the original LPS line work and Figure  3.11b the resulting polygon coverage.       Figure 3.11. Production of a polygon coverage for Northern Ireland.

(b)  A polygon coverage created from (a); note that lines not enclosing an area have  been removed. © NERC (CEH) 2011. © Crown Copyright 2011, Licence Number 100,427. 31    Polygons created from the LPS line work have no attribution to support the merging  process.  The possible consequence is a higher proportion of inappropriate merges  which could lead to mixed parcels and therefore poor classifications.  In practice  however it was found that the subsequent inclusion of lines from image segments  resolved the majority of problems of this kind.  Figure 3.12 shows the LPS Large- scale Vector (a) and generalised LPS Large-scale Vector before (b) and after (c) the  inclusion of image segments.      Figure 3.12.

Agricultural boundary data was not integrated into the NI spatial framework because  preliminary work concluded that the effort to do so was disproportionate to the  potential spatial refinement benefit.  Agricultural datasets are most useful in intensive  arable areas where multi-crops are grown within a single large field. Arable  production in Northern Ireland is less extensive and intensive than many areas of the  UK mainland and field sizes are generally smaller. The exclusion therefore did not  have a detrimental effect on classification as spectral mixing within land parcels was  well resolved by the inclusion of image segments. In other respects the construction  of the spatial framework for Northern Ireland is analogous to that used for Great  Britain.  Table 3.5 shows the size frequency of polygons at key stages of the spatial  framework production.    Generalisation of polygons derived from the LPS Large-scale Vector gave a  reduction to approximately 10% of the original polygon density.  This is a smaller  reduction than was achieved for Great Britain (~6%).  The most likely explanation is  that Northern Ireland has proportionally less urbanisation than Great Britain and it is  in urban areas where the reduction in polygon density from generalisation is 32    greatest.  In dense urban areas generalisation typically achieves reductions to  around 1 to 2% of the original density.      Table 3.5.

Selection of raster images  The key criteria for selecting images were the suitability of the sensor (20-30m pixel  resolution, plus red, NIR and MIR bands) and appropriate acquisition time. The  images used to produce LCM2007 come from Landsat-TM5, LISS-3 and SPOT4/5,  with 60m AWIFS data as a backup as described in Section 3.1. 101 images were  selected and pre-processed, of these 6 were rejected at some point during  processing. Failure was mainly due to contamination by haze and/or cloud, or  problems geocorrecting images that had been poorly orthorectified. Not all the  images processed were used, as some images were superseded by more  appropriate images of the same area. Table 1 of Appendix 2 contains details of all  the images processed. 33        Figure 3.13. Flowchart showing the key stages in the image processing of LCM2007.     Pre-processing of image data  The purpose of image pre-processing is to maximise the spatial and spectral  accuracy of the data set. Good pre-processing is a pre-requisite for accurate  classification and for multiple image-based, multi-sensor mapping it must be robust  and repeatable (Franklin & Wulder, 2002). The pre-processing steps carried out for  LCM2007 are similar to those carried out for LCM2000 (Fuller et al., 2002) and to  those used in other large-scale land cover mapping (Franklin & Wulder, 2002). The  pre-processing flow line for LCM2007 was:   Import data   Apply cloud and cloud-shadow masking   Atmospheric correction   Geo-registration   Topographic correction   Creation of composite images 34    To ensure consistency a handbook (Bradley et al., 2009) was created to define the  pre-processing methods and these were followed by all staff involved in the pre- processing stage. A log was kept for each image documenting the image quality and  image specific parameters ensuring traceability and repeatability.  Pre-processing began by importing the data, after which the cloud and cloud-shadow  masking was conducted via three stages: firstly, identification of the clouds;  secondly, identification of the cloud-shadow; and thirdly by masking the affected  areas. Identification of the cloud was conducted by one of four methods (sometimes  applied in combination):   Identifying cloud reflectance on a scatterplot   Thresholding based on reflectance   Thresholding based on band ratio   Manual digitisation  The first three methods require a threshold to be defined, which is then used to  create a mask, whilst the fourth method requires the user to digitise round the areas  of cloud (and cloud-shadow). The primary method for masking cloud-shadow was by  modelling the expected shadow areas, based on the cloud-mask, illumination  geometry and shadow-offsets in the x- and y- direction for each image. The cloud- shadow masking worked well when the clouds were of relatively uniform height  across the image, but sometimes needed supplementing with manual masking if  cloud height varied. A small number of images were deemed to have „failed‟ at this  stage as the masking showed that the cloud/haze problems were worse than  originally suspected.    Atmospheric correction was applied in ENVI using the FLAASH atmospheric  correction function, which is based on MODTRAN. The images were converted from  digital number to radiance using sensor-specific conversion factors, after which  FLAASH was run, producing atmospherically corrected reflectance.     Most of the images were supplied geo-referenced, but due to multiple image  suppliers and sensors the geometric reliability varied, so all images were geo- registered to either existing images (typically geo-registered images from LCM2000)  or to OS data. The aim was to achieve a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of < 0.3  pixels. Several images failed at this processing stage, possibly due to poor  orthorectification before supply to CEH.    Topographic correction is the process of adjusting the reflectance of an image to  take into account variations in slope angle and aspect, so that the same land cover  on the north and south slopes of a hill will look similar. The topographic correction  code was the same as LCM2000, but ported into an ENVI_IDL compatible format  (Bradley et al., 2009). The topographic correction code uses the Minneart model,  with the calculation of K means, to correct the radiance values. It used slope, aspect  and shaded relief, calculated from NEXTMap Britain and the NI DEM, to correct the  reflectance for topography. There were problems with the correction in winter  images, with very low sun angles and significant topography, and this resulted in  black patches (very low data values) on the north side of hills and mountains. In 35    many cases this could be avoided by taking alternative images i.e. composite 26  (c26) was taken in preference to composite 4 (c04), which covered the same area of  the Lake District, as c26 had a higher winter sun angle producing less topographic  shadow. However, in some cases manual editing was required to correct the  classification in areas of topographic shadow.    Segmentation  All 60 composite images were segmented, using the method developed for  LCM2000.  Segmentation results were combined to create a segment-based vector  framework for the UK. For full details of the segmentation method see Appendix V of  Fuller et al., (2002). The segments were created using 3-band images typically  bands 5, 3 and 1 (winter NIR, summer MIR and summer red). The segmentation  routine was limited to three input bands, so winter NIR was chosen as the brightest  winter band, with red and MIR from the summer for the remaining two bands. In this  way, the three wavebands and two dates of the composite are represented in the  input to the segmentation. The segmentation, using the same method as LCM2000  (Fuller et al., 2002), involved three stages:   Application of an edge detector to locate edges in the raster data.   Segmentation based on seed points located away from edges.   Post-segmentation generalisation, including dissolving small polygons to  produce an acceptable product.  The segmented framework was integrated with the generalised digital cartography  from OSMM and LPS Large-scale Vector (Section 3.3 and 3.4). For NI segments  from single-date images were used to supplement the segments derived from  composite images.    3.6 Image classification  LCM2007 is a parcel-based supervised maximum likelihood classification of the UK  predominantly based on medium resolution (20-30m) satellite data.  It was produced  by classifying 37 composite images and 21 single-date images according to Broad  Habitat-based classes (Table 2.1). Supervised classification uses a training data set  of observed spectral signatures and known land cover to determine the land cover of  unknown parcels. Training areas for the classification were chosen based on the  ground reference points collected during the field trips (Section 3.2). Training  polygons were selected on the basis, of a) being identified by ground reference  points and b) polygon suitability for use as a reference polygon for spectral  classification. For areas and/or habitats poorly represented by ground reference  points OS maps and web-based mapping services were consulted.    Once the training areas had been selected, they were reviewed and similar spectral  signatures corresponding to the same land cover type were grouped into spectral  classes after which the classification was run (see Fuller et al., 2002 for additional  details). The classification used a maximum likelihood classifier (an automated  process) that assigns class probability based on probability contours around the  training areas (Allaby & Allaby, 1999). In LCM2007 the probabilities of the top five  spectral classes (i.e. those that matched the observed spectral signature for the  polygon most closely) were recorded. The process of classification is iterative, with 36    each classification being reviewed and re-classified until the accuracy reaches the  required level, or until the classification can no longer be improved. The review stage  would typically identify classes which were not being classified well enough, so  additional training areas would be identified and/or the grouping of the spectral  classes would be modified, after which the classification would be re-run.     In practice, for one of the more widespread Broad Habitats in a medium sized  satellite scene there may be between 5 and 15 spectral training classes, each of  which might have up to 15 training polygons. For a heavily arable area more than 30  classes may be needed to capture the spectral signatures of all the fields. These  figures vary dramatically between images depending on the Broad Habitats within  the scene and the range of spectral variability within the Broad Habitats. In some  polygons there is a mix of more than one habitat – this is particularly true for the  more semi-natural, less managed areas and in these cases the aim is to identify the  most widespread Broad Habitat.    Apply manual edits  Sometimes it was necessary to manually edit the classification. These edits typically  occurred when a rare land cover class was located in an image. Trying to classify the  rare class sometimes creates uncertainty with other classes and unsatisfactory  mapping. An example, of this might be a quarry, which is classed as urban despoiled  and sits in the „Inland Bare‟ Broad Habitat. Attempting to classify based purely on  spectral signature might lead to confusion with urban land cover, which falls into the  „Built-up Areas and Gardens‟ Broad Habitat. Some winter images with problems due  to the topographic correction needed manual correction. The decision on class for a  manually classified polygon was informed by a variety of sources, including the  satellite images (or overlapping images), OS maps and web-based map services.    Hole-filling  Landsat7-ETM+ data were used to manually classify small areas of some ETM+  scenes, when no other imagery was available. This avoided the need to fill holes  using LCM2000 data. 12 ETM+ images spanning 22/01/2006 - 30/05/2009 were  processed and available for manual classification (see Table 3 of Appendix 2).  Manual classification was conducted by overlaying the spatial framework on the  raster data and manually selecting all the polygons of each Broad Habitat. It was a  pragmatic solution given the problems with ETM+, plus the lack of other suitable data  in an appropriate timeframe.    3.7 Knowledge-based enhancements     Knowledge-based enhancements (KBEs) resolve spectral confusion and/or increase  the thematic resolution of land cover using contextual and ancillary information.   They comprise regionally adaptive rules that reassign land parcels to a more  appropriate land cover class and therefore enhance the accuracy of LCM2007.   KBE‟s modified approximately 20% of LCM2007 land parcels. 37    Spectral confusion  LCM2007 land parcels are classified using red, near and mid infra-red spectral  bands. These bands offer the best discriminatory power for vegetated surfaces  (Fuller and Parsell, 1990). Spectral confusion occurs when different surface types  have similar reflectance properties.  For example, an arable field that has been  recently ploughed has little or no chlorophyll to absorb red light and will appear bright  in this band.  Likewise so will a road, a car park, an open-cast quarry, a sandy or  shingle beach, and a limestone pavement. If these surfaces have similar reflectance  qualities for mid and near infra red light it becomes very difficult to distinguish  between them using reflectance alone. Using image composites from different  stages in the growing season (Section 3.6) can help to resolve some of this  confusion. For example, if an arable land parcel in a winter scene displays a  ploughed field and the summer scene displays crops, the composite information will  be sufficient to distinguish this parcel from those that are permanently non- vegetated. However, if the summer scene occurs after harvest when the vegetation  has been removed the composite information may be of little or no help.  The above gives just one example of a common spectral confusion encountered in  the production of LCM2007, but spectral confusion occurs between many land cover  types.  To detect spectral confusion we examine a land parcel against a knowledge  base comprised from contextual and ancillary data.  If confusion is suspected  knowledge-based enhancement rules (KBE rules) are used to assign a revised land  cover class.  Taking the arable example further, suppose we detect a land parcel  that has been classified as urban, it is shaped like a field, is surrounded by arable  fields and exists far from known urban boundaries.  It is quite likely that this is an  arable field that has been misclassified because at the time of image capture it had a  similar reflectance to nearby urban parcels.  A KBE rule should therefore pick this up  and reassign it to an arable class.  Of course there is always the risk of the „false- positive‟.  The land parcel may be an out of town industrial area or an open-cast  quarry, in which case the reassignment to arable would be inappropriate.   In fact it is  inevitable that some reassignments are wrong, but the purpose of the KBEs is to „get  it right‟ most of the time and thereby improve the overall accuracy of the product.  To  minimise reassignment errors we suppress KBEs in regions where we expect they  will be inappropriate.  We also include manual inspections and corrections (Section  3.6).    Thematic resolution    KBEs are also used to enhance thematic resolution.  LCM2007 aims to provide land  cover as target classes related to Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats  (Table 2.1).  However, the information that can be gleaned from optical satellites is  frequently insufficient for this. Put simply, some Broad Habitats cannot be  determined from optical imagery.  UK BAP grassland habitats offer a good example.   The UK BAP specifies four grassland Broad Habitats: „Acid Grassland‟, „Calcareous  Grassland‟, „Improved Grassland‟ and „Neutral Grassland‟. Acid, Calcareous and  Neutral grasslands are considered semi-natural and are characterised by their  species composition.  However, these compositions do not each have a distinct  reflectance at the spatial resolutions of satellite data used for LCM2007 and cannot  be separated.  In fact, using reflectance we can only reliably distinguish improved 38    from rough grassland (relatively unimproved), and these lie on a continuum with  confusion near the middle.    At its extreme improved grassland has typically been modified by extensive fertiliser  use and reseeding.  It is chlorophyll rich all year round and contains an insignificant  amount of dead material.  This gives it a very characteristic signal.  Conversely at  any time of year rough grassland may have a significant amount of dead material  from previous seasons; this increases reflectance of the mid and near infra red  bands. There is also less chlorophyll, so less photosynthesis and more red  reflectance making it spectrally dissimilar from recently improved grassland.    Improved grassland maps directly to a single BAP Broad Habitat.   Rough grassland  does not.  BAP semi-natural grasslands will in general fall within the rough grassland  category.  However, this represents a many-to-one relationship, so to resolve rough- grassland to a BAP Broad Habitat we need additional information.  Suppose that a  land parcel has been spectrally classified as rough grassland. After examining its  relationship with the knowledge base it is found to be growing on an acid soil and at  an altitude typically beyond the limit for improved grassland and arable (the most  likely confusion classes).  Given this information it becomes highly likely that the  Broad Habitat cover is „Acid Grassland‟ and a KBE rule should reassign it.    The Knowledge Base  Ancillary data from a variety of sources was compiled and processed to form the  knowledge base.  Knowledge was grouped into four types, described below.    Urban context  We have discussed above how urban context can resolve misclassified arable.   It  can help with many other types of confusion too.  For example, a parcel classified as  Inland Bare in an urban context is more likely to be part of the dense urban fabric  and is better represented by an urban class.  Government agencies maintain readily accessible spatial datasets which outline  urban and settlement boundaries.  Boundaries for England and Wales were obtained  from the Office for National Statistics and relate to the 2001 census.  Boundaries for  Scotland were from the Scottish Executive Urban Rural Classification of 2003-2004.  Boundaries for Northern Ireland were obtained from the Northern Ireland Statistics  and Research Agency and come from the Statistical Classification and Delineation of  Settlements of 2005. Where boundaries were considered insufficient additional  urban areas were manually digitised.    Coastal proximity  Coastal proximity helps detect inappropriately labelled land parcels. For example,  Littoral Sediment encountered 40 miles from coast has certainly been confused with  another class; perhaps an urban or an arable land cover.  An outline of the UK Coastline was used to create three zones:  the coastal zone in  which coastal classes are permissible; the offshore zone in which terrestrial classes 39    are not; and the terrestrial zone in which coastal habitats cannot occur.  Because of  the UK's variable coastal topography these zones were defined per satellite scene.    Terrain  Terrain information has many uses.  For example coastal classes will not be found at  altitude. Parcels with a very steep gradient are unlikely to be „Arable or Improved  Grassland‟ if the gradient is too steep for agricultural machinery.  Urban land cover is  very rare in the montane zone.    Terrain for Great Britain was derived from the NEXTMap Britain Digital Elevation  Model.  For Northern Ireland the terrain model created for LCM2000 was used.  For  each parcel we recorded altitude, slope and aspect.    Soil Type  Soil type is a key arbiter of land cover type, especially when combined with other  contextual information.  For example, Rough grassland or Heather grassland on a  bog soil on a shallow slope is quite likely to be Bog.  Grassland at low altitude in the  tidal flooding zone on a saltmarsh soil is quite likely to be Saltmarsh.  Soil information for the UK is maintained by distinct bodies. For England and Wales  we used the National Soil Resources Institute (NSRI) Soilscapes product. For  Scotland we used a bespoke dataset provided the Macaulay Land Use Research  Institute (now James Hutton Institute) which combined soil series with land cover  information from the Land Cover of Scotland (LCS88) product. The Agri-Food and  Bioscience Institute (AFBI) of Northern Ireland provided a bespoke product with soil  information given in the NSRI Soilscapes schema.   Soil data from these agencies were generalised into the following soil types: Acid,  Bog, Calcareous, Fen, Neutral, Saltmarsh, Sand dune, Water, and Other. This level  of detail was sufficient for KBEs and casting all the products into the same 'currency'  made the development of general rules and algorithms more straightforward.    KBE Algorithms  Seven automated KBE algorithms were developed.  The algorithms examine a  parcel's context relative to the knowledge base and then apply KBE rules.  KBE  algorithms were applied in sequence with the results of each stage being the start  point for the next.  This sequential application optimises the integration of  knowledge.   A land parcel may go through a sequence of reassignments, ideally  each time converging towards the „truth‟.  For example, „Littoral Sediment‟ found too  far from the coast may change to „Inland Rock‟ but then a subsequent algorithm  determines that the parcel exists within an urban boundary so it then becomes „Built- up Areas and Gardens‟.  Records of the application of KBE algorithms are  maintained against each parcel and are supplied with the LCM2007 vector product  (Section 4.3).   Full details of the algorithms are beyond the scope of this text but an overview of  each is given below.  The order in which the algorithms are described represents the 40    order in which they were applied to classification scenes.  After the first pass an  additional run of the Terrain and Soil algorithms was applied to capture any  remaining assignment errors.  The general operation sequence of a KBE algorithm  is:   examine a land parcel against context,    if its classification is considered inappropriate, inspect the five most likely land  cover classes from the maximum likelihood classification result.   If a suitable alternative is found within this list assign this land cover, else  apply a specialised sequence of rules to  assign a more realistic land cover.    Terrain algorithm  The terrain algorithm is straightforward but quickly picks up a lot of classification  irregularities.  It takes account of a land parcel‟s slope and altitude to assign a more  appropriate class.  For example, it assigns land cover at high altitudes (>800m for  southern UK (south of Birmingham) and >600m for Northern UK) to „Montane  Habitats‟. „Arable and Horticulture‟ parcels on very steep slopes would also be  assigned to a more appropriate land cover, as would coastal classes at high altitude.  Soil algorithm  The soil algorithm is more complex. It integrates soil type with urban context, terrain  and coastal proximity to refine or improve the thematic resolution of land cover.    This algorithm is essential for separating „Acid Grassland‟, „Calcareous Grassland‟,  and „Neutral Grassland‟ from Rough grassland.  It is also helps with the  classification of „Bog‟ and Saltmarsh, which are often unreliably, resolved using  spectral data alone.  Terrestrial zone algorithm  Coastal habitats cannot occur in the terrestrial zone.  Any parcels that have been  classified as a coastal habitat that have not been resolved by the terrain algorithm  are reassigned by this algorithm to a more appropriate class.    Offshore algorithm  This algorithm picks up classes that are not possible offshore.  For example,  grassland or arable parcels located offshore are highly likely to be wrong.   Saltmarsh or „Littoral Sediment‟ are assigned as more likely alternatives.  Within urban boundary algorithm  This algorithm is applied to all parcels that lie within the urban boundary.  It resolves  common spectral confusions that occur with urban sealed surfaces.  For example,  urban parcels can have a similar spectral response to areas of naturally exposed  bare rock, littoral sediments, and in some cases arable.   In reassigning a new land  cover class the algorithm will also take account of the parcel‟s immediate  neighbourhood and geometric properties to obtain the most likely alternative.  Outside urban boundary algorithm  This algorithm is the converse of the above.  It checks for parcels assigned to an  urban class that lie outside the urban boundary.  The urban areas and settlement  boundaries frequently do not cover the smaller villages, hamlets and isolated  farmsteads that occur throughout the wider countryside.  These structures obviously  fall within the BAP „Built-up Areas and Gardens‟ Broad Habitat and so to simply  reassign all urban parcels that occur outside of the urban context would be wrong. 41    Distinguishing misclassified urban from true urban is tricky.  Local context and  geometric properties are key.  For example, small urban parcels (<1ha) with irregular  boundaries adjacent to objects with similar qualities quite possibly are small  settlements or farmsteads, so are ignored.  Large urban parcels shaped like fields,  surrounded arable fields are highly likely to be misclassified arable.   Water  This algorithm improves the thematic resolution of water.  Water absorbs much of  the red and infra red spectra and appears dark, except where it is particularly  shallow or turbid, and is easily distinguished from the surrounding landscape.   However, there is no spectral distinction between coastal and inland water.  When a  water parcel occurs in the offshore zone it is labelled as Sea water (Ws).  When it  interacts with the coastal zone or occurs inland the shape of the land parcel is used  to categorise it.  If it is elongate and coastal then it is labelled as estuarine (We) and  if it is elongate then it is labelled as a river (Wr), otherwise it is labelled as a lake  (Wl).     3.8 Assembling full UK coverage   LCM2007 is the first UK land cover map to be produced as a continuous vector  product.  Due to differences in spatial reference systems it is maintained as two  spatial databases: one for GB and one for NI.  LCM2000 like LCM2007 gives a  complete UK vector coverage but it is not continuous.  LCM2000 was produced as  discrete 100km x 100km tiles.  Image segmentation and classifications were  performed on a per tile basis.  As a consequence of this spatial and thematic  inconsistencies occur at boundaries where tiles meet.  In order to produce a  continuous single layer coverage that exceeds the extent of an individual tile, users  have to apply complex merging processes.  By providing a continuous coverage  LCM2007 overcomes this problem.    Producing a continuous coverage from the many composite and single-date  classifications requires a strategy for dealing with overlapping regions and assigning  priority to the best classifications. This was achieved by splitting the UK into nine  relatively independent chunks (Figure 12, Appendix 3). The chunks were chosen to  maximise the natural divisions in the data and the diagonal boundaries reflect the  swathes of the satellite data. After the chunks had been defined, the priority of each  classification was determined based on the quality of the final classification, with the  best classifications having the highest priorities. Table 6 shows the final order of  images according to chunk, with arrows showing how images that fall into two or  more chunks are catered for. Chunks 6 and 7 are merged in Table 6, because of the  high degree of overlap between them. In general, the composites produced the best  classifications, but in some cases single-date hole-filling scenes produced better  classifications than overlapping composites. This was because the single-date hole- filling images typically covered small areas with a limited range of both spectral and  Broad Habitat variation, which minimises the opportunity for spectral confusion  between classes resulting in a better classification. 42    Table 3.6. Order of priority for classifications across the 9 chunks. Note images beginning with  ‘C’ are composite images, whilst those beginning with ‘I’ are single-date images (see  Appendices 2 and 3 for further details).

This section presents a  validation of LCM2007 by assessing it against the ground reference data set  collected during the field trips. The aim of the comparison is to assess the accuracy  of LCM2007. The results are displayed in a correspondence matrix which is a table  used to compare two classifications. The correspondence matrix shows where  LCM2007 and the ground reference data set correspond and diverge.      Validation of LCM2007 with ground reference data  Selected ground reference points (Section 3.2) were used to validate the  classification, both during the classification stage (in conjunction with visual checks)  (Section 3.2), and after the final LCM2007 data set was created. This section reports  the results of the comparison between the 9127 LCM2007 ground reference  polygons and the final LCM2007 product (Table 3.7).     The field trip points were used to identify suitable training areas for the classification  (i.e. a training data set), and also to identify suitable points for a ground reference  data set against which to validate the product (i.e. a testing data set). The training  and testing data set are separate groups of ground reference points. The accuracy of  LCM2007 is defined by comparison against the ground reference (testing) data set.  In some cases ground reference points and polygons were poorly aligned and in  other cases the ground reference points were only appropriate for part of the polygon  - this mainly occurred in natural or semi-natural areas, although it did affect some  woodlands and fields. Ground reference points were only assigned as validation  points if the person conducting the classification was confident that the ground  reference point was appropriate for the polygon. This excludes polygons with mixed  Broad Habitats (shown by multiple ground reference points within a single-polygon)  or where ground reference points fell in adjacent polygons. Once a ground reference  point has been accepted as appropriate, for a polygon in the LCM2007 project  database, the polygon becomes a ground reference polygon.     Results  The correspondence, between LCM2007 and the 9127 ground reference polygons  (Table 3.7), shows that the overall accuracy of LCM2007 is 83%. Information about  the classification of individual classes is also given in the correspondence matrix  (Table 3.7).     Table 3.7 is a correspondence matrix and is data rich, but due to the number of  classes in LCM2007 it is not straightforward to interpret. Using „Bog‟ as an example,  the Producer‟s accuracy (see glossary) quantifies how well areas mapped as „Bog‟ in  LCM2007 match the ground reference polygons. Table 3.7 shows „Bog‟ is 93%  accurate against the ground reference polygons. The User‟s accuracy (see glossary)  gives the probability of a parcel of a given class being correctly classified. In the case  of „Improved Grassland‟, the User‟s accuracy is 83% and the Producer‟s accuracy is  89%. Therefore, based on the User‟s accuracy of 83%, there is a 0.83 probability  that a parcel classified as „Improved Grassland‟ will be correctly classified. The  Producer‟s accuracy quantifies how well areas mapped as „Improved Grassland‟ in 44    LCM2007 match the ground reference polygons. The User‟s and Producer‟s  accuracy can vary independently of each other, although accurate classes will have  high values for both the User‟s and Producer‟s accuracies.      The LCM2007 classes are grouped below based on the User‟s and Producer‟s  accuracy. Note that requiring both accuracy values to be above a threshold means  that the classes are grouped by the lowest of their two accuracy values, so the  location of „Bog‟ is determined by the User‟s accuracy (39%), rather than the  Producer‟s accuracy (93%).   > 90% for User’s accuracy and Producer’s accuracy:   „Coniferous Woodland‟   „Arable and Horticulture‟   ‘Littoral Rock‟   > 80% for User’s accuracy and Producer’s accuracy   Broadleaf woodland   „Improved Grassland‟   Littoral Sediment   Urban   Suburban   Saltmarsh   Freshwater   ‘Supra-littoral Rock‟   > 70% for User’s accuracy and Producer’s accuracy   „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟   Heather   „Supra-littoral Sediment‟   > 60% for User’s accuracy and Producer’s accuracy   Saltwater   > 50% for User’s accuracy and Producer’s accuracy    „Calcareous Grassland‟   Heather grassland  < 50% for User’s accuracy and Producer’s accuracy   Rough grassland   „Acid Grassland‟   „Neutral Grassland‟   „Bog‟   „Montane Habitats‟    Accuracy is class-specific, with classes using external data sets for knowledge- based enhancements tending to have the lowest accuracy. The problem with  „Calcareous Grassland‟ and „Neutral Grassland‟ is largely due to spectral confusion  with „Improved Grassland‟ and Rough grassland. The confusion with Rough  grassland is partly due to differences between what it is possible to discern in the  field and what can be achieved by spectral classification, KBEs and a soil data set.  The „Montane Habitats‟ designation is expected to be correct for areas mapped as  „Montane Habitats‟, but may underestimate in some areas, especially NW Scotland.    In some cases it may be useful for user‟s to apply their own bespoke validation,  especially where extensive work is planned based on a county or smaller subset of  data (see Appendix 4). 45    Table 3.7.

Producer‟s accuracy = percentage of ground reference polygons classified correctly. User‟s accuracy = probability (expressed as a percentage) of a  polygon of a particular class being correctly classified. 46    Chapter 4: Comparison with Countryside  Survey in 2007    4.1 Introduction  This chapter presents the results of a comparison of LCM2007 with Countryside  Survey (CS) in 2007. The aim is to establish confidence in LCM2007 and quantify  the correspondence between the LCM2007 and CS by comparing LCM2007 with:   The 591 Countryside Survey 1x1km squares in Great Britain   The Countryside Survey estimates of Broad Habitat area for England, Wales,  Scotland, Northern Ireland and the UK  The first method produces a correspondence matrix. The second method produces a  table showing the LCM2007 estimates of Broad Habitat area with the Broad Habitat  estimates of area and confidence limits from the CS in 2007.     4.2 Comparison with Countryside Survey squares  Countryside Survey in 2007 surveyed 591 1x1km squares recording Broad Habitat  cover, plus more detailed information (Carey et al., 2008). The LCM2007 and  Countryside Survey data sets are very different and to increase compatibility  between the two, Countryside Survey polygons below the LCM2007 MMU width and  area were excluded, as were the Countryside Survey Mosaic and „Boundary and  Linear Features‟ classes, as there is no LCM2007 equivalent. Note, the Countryside  Survey Mosaic class is used when the field surveyors encounter a mix of Broad  Habitat types where it is not possible to map discrete areas of a single habitat  exceeding the CS MMU. The field surveyors do record proportions of the Broad  Habitats comprising the Mosaic polygons, but it would not be straightforward to  include them in this analysis, so this class was excluded. Other differences, between  CS in 2007 and LCM2007, such as LCM2007 mapping „Standing Open Water and  Canals‟ and „Rivers and Streams‟ as a composite Freshwater class, were accounted  for when the correspondence matrix was created. Equivalent data for Northern  Ireland were not available to include in this analysis.    An area-based comparison was conducted between the 591 Countryside Survey  squares and the corresponding areas of LCM2007. The correspondence was  calculated by comparing the polygons in CS with the same area in LCM2007 and  recording the area of Broad Habitat. This was conducted for each square in turn,  enabling the correspondence for each square to be calculated, and the squares were  then aggregated to enable production of correspondence tables for the: UK,  England, Scotland and Wales.     Whilst every effort is taken to ensure the accuracy of CS data there are errors, due  to habitat definition issues, as well as individual surveyor‟s interpretations. As a  result the comparison between LCM2007 and CS in 2007 is about discerning  correspondence and divergence, rather than accuracy. In addition, the timing of field 47    survey and image acquisition may not coincide, allowing changes to occur in the  intervening period. Given that Countryside Survey is about 81% repeatable (Norton  et al., 2009) and that LCM2007 aims for an accuracy of > 80% at the Broad Habitat  level, then combining these two accuracy levels suggests a likely correspondence of  about 65% (80% x 81% = 65%). However, this does not take into account the  different spatial structures of the two products, which although much closer than they  used to be, still differ.  This will have a tendency to reduce areal correspondence  values.    The correspondences are reported for the UK, plus England, Scotland and Wales,  and are calculated for a range of thematic levels:  -  The Broad Habitats common to LCM2007 and CS in 2007.  -  Aggregate class level (Aggregate classes are defined in Table 2.2,  Chapter 2).  -  Broad Habitat Association (BHA) level.  Broad Habitat Association (BHA)  The Broad Habitat Association concept provides an additional measure of thematic  correspondence, which has some similarities to the Aggregate class thematic level,  but is more targeted. A key factor underlying the Broad Habitat Association (BHA)  concept is that the land cover maps provide land cover, which may relate uniquely to  one Broad Habitat or may have a one-to-many relationship with several Broad  Habitats. For example, deciduous woodland uniquely maps to the „Broadleaved,  Mixed and Yew Woodland‟ Broad Habitat, whereas rough grassland has a one-to- many relationship with habitat, and may be „Acid Grassland‟, „Calcareous  Grassland‟, „Neutral Grassland‟, poor quality  „Improved Grassland‟  or even in some  cases „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟ or „Bog‟. These distinctions can be difficult to make  from remote sensing and even in the field; they are especially difficult when they  occur as mosaics where the dominant (most widespread) land cover may vary  depending upon the polygon boundaries.     In this type of situation the identification of „associated‟ habitats which form different  Broad Habitats, as defined by Jackson (2000), is useful. The cross-habitat links in  Table 4.1 formalises some of the uncertainties between mapping land cover and  assigning it to a habitat-based classification [see Appendix 5 for further details]. The  similarity of land cover for different BH is most pronounced for grassland and semi- natural upland areas, where mosaic landscapes maybe poorly represented spatially  by the scale of the parcel-based structure in LCM2007, so these habitats dominate  Table 4.1. In practice this means that as well as squares down the main diagonal of  the correspondence matrix being accepted as corresponding directly, some  additional cells are considered as corresponding directly. For clarity the cells used to  calculate the BHA correspondence are shaded orange in Tables 4.3 & 4.5-4.7.              Broad Habitat Association (BHA): BHA identifies prescribed habitat links (Table  4.1) which form allowable correspondence between CS and LCM2007 classes e.g.  „Bog‟ is acceptable for „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟ at the BHA-level.     The purpose of using BHAs is to separate correspondences which are slightly  different e.g. „Bog‟ and „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟, compared to those that are very  different e.g. „Montane Habitats‟ and „Arable and Horticulture‟. 48    Table 4.1. Summary of correspondences allowed for Broad Habitat Association (whether due  to transitional habitats, mosaic habitats, limitations of KBE’s or difference in interpretation  between Countryside Survey field survey and LCM).    LCM  CS Field Survey  „Bog‟  „Montane Habitats‟  „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟  „Acid Grassland‟  „Montane Habitats‟  „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟  „Acid Grassland‟  „Bog‟  „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟  „Acid Grassland‟  Rough grassland  „Acid Grassland‟  „Calcareous Grassland‟  „Neutral Grassland‟  „Improved Grassland‟  „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟  „Bog‟  Water  „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟  Acid grassland  Broadleaved woodland  Rough grassland  Any grassland  „Built-up Areas and  Gardens‟  Any water  „Built-up Areas and  Gardens‟  Any water  Any water  Saltwater  „Littoral Rock‟  „Littoral Sediment‟    Interpretation of correspondence values  Comparing spatial datasets with disparate spatial resolutions and thematic  specifications is not straightforward and careful interpretation is required.  Figure 4.1  shows three CS squares, with correspondence from 50% to 90%. The figure clearly  demonstrates the differences in the level of detail between the Countryside Survey,  with a MMU of 0.04ha, and LCM2007, with a MMU of 0.5ha. Spatial differences are  particularly evident in Figure 4.1a where small and narrow objects, representing  clumps of trees, roads and rivers have been removed by the generalisation of  OSMM.  There is also displacement and simplification of boundaries where narrow  and small features have been „absorbed‟ into their surroundings.    Figure 4.1a shows field survey and LCM squares with a direct correspondence of  50%, which sounds low, but it would be wrong to interpret this as a 50% error.  Instead, as Figure 4.1a shows the Countryside Survey and LCM2007 squares look  quite similar. Both versions of the square are predominantly a mix of „Improved  Grassland‟, Broadleaved woodland and „Neutral Grassland‟ with the main  differences being the extra spatial detail in the field survey square and the  distribution of grassland types. The 50% example also shows two „Fen, Marsh and  Swamp‟ polygons near the top of the CS square, which in LCM2007 are covered by 49    a single polygon that extends further to the west and is classified as „Broadleaf,  Mixed and Yew Woodland‟.     The level of spatial complexity (basically the number of polygons) is highest in the  lowest correspondence square (Fig. 4.1). The simpler spatial structure of the 70%  and 90% correspondence squares produces a better spatial match between the two.     Figure 4.2 shows the same areas as Figure 4.1, but with a single grassland class  incorporating Acid, Neutral, Calcareous, Rough and „Improved grassland‟. The  correspondence between the Countryside Survey and LCM2007 data has been  updated to reflect the single grassland class. When all grassland is combined into a  single class the correspondence for square a) increases from 50% (Fig. 4.1a) to 87%  (Fig. 4.2a). Fig. 4.2a shows the mix of grassland and woodland between the two  squares is similar, with some of the remaining differences being due to the spatial  heterogeneity of the landscape. Therefore, for some uses better results may be  achieved by grouping all grassland into a single grassland class.    Table 4.2. Degree of correspondence between CS in 2007 and LCM2007 for Broad Habitat,  Broad Habitat Association, and Broad Habitats with a single-grassland class.      Correspondence between CS2007 and LCM2007  Square  (in Figs. 5.1 and 5.2)  Broad Habitat  correspondence  (%)  Broad Habitat  Association  correspondence (%)  BH with single  grassland class  correspondence (%)  a  50  75  87  b  70  79  85  c  90  92  90    Correspondence matrices   Correspondence matrices can be summarised by giving the Producers accuracy and  the Users accuracy. The Producer‟s accuracy (the percentage values in the bottom  two rows of Tables 4.3 & 4.5-4.7) show how well the CS in 2007 Broad Habitats are  classified by LCM2007. The User‟s accuracy (the percentage values in the last two  columns of Tables 4.3 & 4.5-4.7) shows the probability that an LCM2007 polygon of  a particular class is likely to be that on the ground, based on the comparison with  CS2007. The user‟s and Producer‟s accuracies are important tools for understanding  the correspondence matrix and their respective roles are best illustrated by example.  Table 4.3 shows that the Producer‟s correspondence between CS in 2007 and  LCM2007 is 90% for „Arable and Horticulture‟, whereas the User‟s correspondence  between LCM2007 and CS in 2007 for „Arable and Horticulture‟ is 73%. What this  means is that 90% of the CS squares mapped as „Arable and Horticulture‟ are also  mapped as „Arable and Horticulture‟ in LCM2007; whereas 73% of the land mapped  as „Arable and Horticulture‟ in LCM2007 corresponds with „Arable and Horticulture‟ in  the CS dataset.  The differences are subtle but important.  It might help to imagine a  simplified situation where the whole of the land surface has been mapped as „Arable  and Horticulture‟, when in reality „Arable and Horticulture‟ covers say 10% of the land  surface.  In this instance Producer accuracy would be 100%, since the whole area  known to be „Arable and Horticulture‟ has been mapped as „Arable and Horticulture‟.  This looks encouraging until you consider the User accuracy of only 10%.  This low 50    value implies that 90 % of the land has been incorrectly mapped.  Clearly Producer  and User accuracy should be considered together, and by doing so map users gain  insight into the varying reliabilities of different land cover classes.  The 73% User  accuracy for LCM2007 „Arable and Horticulture‟ assessed against CS in 2007  implies that LCM2007 estimates for the extent of „Arable and Horticulture‟ will be  around 27% greater than those coming from CS 2007.  And in fact LCM2007 does  produce an approximately 30% higher national estimate for „Arable and Horticulture‟  than CS in 2007 (this point is discussed further in Section 4.3).    The comparison between the Countryside Survey in 2007 squares for Great Britain  and LCM2007 show an overall correspondence of 62% at the Broad Habitat level  (Table 4.3), 67% at the aggregate level (Table 4.4) and 76% at the associated BH- level (Table 4.3). For the common Broad Habitats (defined here as those covering  more than 10,000km2 of the UK (based on CS values in Table 4.9)), the Producer‟s  accuracy ranges from 16% („Neutral Grassland‟) to 90% („Arable and Horticulture‟).  The User‟s accuracy, also for the common Broad Habitats, varies from 37% („Dwarf  Shrub Heath‟) to 89% („Built-up Areas and Gardens‟). The results presented in this  section focus on the Producer‟s correspondence. The issues which would be raised  by the User‟s accuracy are covered in Section 4.3, which focuses on the extent of  Broad Habitat from both LCM2007 and CS in 2007.     The BHA are the same as the BH-level for some classes, but for many of the upland  classes the correspondence is higher, for example, „Bog‟ goes from 37% at the BH- level to 96% at the BHA-level, as much of the difference between CS in 2007 and  LCM2007 was due to the separation of „Bog‟, „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟ and „Acid  Grassland‟.     The correspondence of Countryside Survey „Littoral Rock‟ with LCM2007 is 0% in  both the BH-level and BHA-level, as LCM2007 has the areas mapped as „Littoral  Sediment‟ and „Supra-littoral Sediment‟. This confusion is mainly between the  coastal classes, so the Aggregate class correspondence for the coastal classes is  higher at 66% (Table 4.4). Reducing the thematic resolution to Aggregate class level  produces a range of correspondence from 35% for semi-natural grassland, through  to 90% for „Arable and Horticulture‟ and 91% for Freshwater (Table 4.4).    Fig. 4.1 illustrates three of the main differences, between the field survey and  LCM2007, as shown by Table 4.3, specifically:   The higher proportion of „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟ in CS in 2007  compared to LCM2007 (Fig. 4.1a).   The mismatch between recording of „Neutral Grassland‟ and „Improved  Grassland‟ between the two data sets (Fig. 4.1a and b).   Differences in the uplands based on the distribution of „Bog‟, „Acid  Grassland‟ and „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟ (Fig. 4.1c). 51        Figure 4.1.

Green squares correspond at Aggregate class level. (Units are ha).        4.2.1 Assessment by class  Broadleaved woodland - the correspondence matrix (Table 4.3) shows that  LCM2007 and Countryside Survey in 2007 have a 64% correspondence for  broadleaved woodland, with the primary sources of divergence being:   LCM2007 recording areas as Broadleaved woodland, whilst Countryside  Survey records them as „Coniferous Woodland‟ (205ha).  This may in part be  due to mixed woodland (see definition, Appendix 1, as determining the mix  between deciduous and coniferous, and hence whether the area falls into the  „Broadleaved Woodland‟ or „Coniferous Woodland‟ category, is subject to  surveyor interpretation. Deciduous larch forests may also be having an  impact, as spectrally they look more similar to deciduous broadleaved  woodland than coniferous woodland.    LCM2007 records some areas as „Improved Grassland‟, whilst Countryside  Survey records them as „Broadleaved Woodland‟ (194ha). This may be due to  differences separating the point at which improved grassland with trees  becomes woodland, as the transition between the two is based on accurate  assessment of percentage tree cover. The differences in polygon structure  between the data sets may also affect whether tree cover is great enough to  count as woodland.  ‘Coniferous Woodland’ - the correspondence between Countryside Survey in  2007 and LCM2007, at 83%, is very high. However, Countryside Survey „Coniferous  Woodland‟ does correspond to LCM2007 Broadleaved woodland and „Dwarf Shrub  Heath‟ in some cases. The correspondence with „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟ is likely to be 55    partly spectral confusion, but also recently felled stands, or recently replanted  stands, where much of the spectral response is due to heather and grass around the  young trees. Rides between woodland stands and open patches are also often „Acid  Grassland‟ or „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟ dominated and maybe having an influence here.    „Arable and Horticulture’ - the correspondence is 90% (8643ha correspond  directly). The main divergence between the two data sets for „Arable and  Horticulture‟ is with „Improved Grassland‟, although it is minor. Countryside Survey in  2007 recorded 1944 ha of LCM2007 arable as „Improved Grassland‟ and LCM2007  recorded 654ha of Countryside Survey in 2007 arable as „Improved Grassland‟. This  may reflect differences in interpretation between the two data sets, with CS recording  agricultural ley as „Arable‟, whereas in the fallow/pasture period LCM would record it  as „Improved Grassland‟.    „Improved Grassland’ - the correspondence between the two data sets is 70%  at the Broad Habitat level, and 77% at the Broad Habitat Association level, which  accepts that some low productivity, improved grassland is contained within the  LCM2007 Rough grassland class. The main mis-match between Countryside  Survey in 2007 recorded „Improved Grassland‟ is the 1944 ha which LCM2007  records as „Arable and Horticulture‟.  This difference may relate to:   Rotation farming where the survey year differed between the two data sets.    Misclassification in images where recently mown hay may have been  indistinguishable from arable.    Misclassification in images/composites using a spring, rather than summer  image, where the spectral separability between arable and improved  grassland was at a minimum.    Heavily grazed land may appear spectrally to resemble arable more than  improved grassland.    Differences in the spatial structure between the two data sets.  „Neutral Grassland’ - the correspondence between the two data sets is 16%.  The low correspondence demonstrates the difficulty of identifying this habitat reliably  from satellite data. In the field it is determined on botanical composition and it also  includes semi-improved grasslands managed for silage, hay or pasture (Jackson,  2000), which in LCM2007 will often be classified as „Improved Grassland‟. This is  illustrated by the correspondence (Table 4.3) which shows that 56% of the 4371ha of  „Neutral Grassland‟ recorded by Countryside Survey is classified by LCM2007 as  „Improved Grassland‟ (2478ha), with the rest as a mix of mainly „Arable and  Horticulture‟ and „Acid Grassland‟.     „Calcareous Grassland’ - Countryside Survey in 2007 recorded 102ha of  „Calcareous Grassland‟ of which LCM2007 recorded 1ha, however, LCM2007  recorded 29ha of Rough grassland but the KBE (Section 3.7) was not able to  convert this with confidence to „Calcareous Grassland‟. 28ha of „Calcareous  Grassland‟ was classified as „Improved Grassland‟ as spectrally they are often very  similar. The 28ha of Countryside Survey „Calcareous Grassland‟, which LCM2007  has recorded as „Supralittoral Sediment‟ are probably all Machair grasslands.  Machair grassland is a Priority Habitat, which sits under the „Supralittoral Sediment‟ 56    habitat (Jackson, 2000), though it may have the species composition of a  „Calcareous Grassland‟.    „Acid Grassland’ - Countryside Survey in 2007 „Acid Grassland‟ shows 45%  correspondence with LCM2007 at the Broad Habitat level rising to 87% if adjacent  habitats (highlighted orange in Table 4.3), such as „Dwarf Shrub Heath„, „Bog‟,  „Montane Habitats‟ and Rough grassland are taken into account. This shows that  there is strong agreement between the two data sets over the general type of  habitat, in this case upland. The differences are in the assessment of whether  grassland or heather dominated, or if the peat is thick enough to classify as „Bog‟.  These difficulties and resultant differences are to be expected in upland  environments where habitats form complex mosaics.    ‘Fen, Marsh and Swamp’ - Countryside Survey records 479ha of „Fen, Marsh  and Swamp‟ across the field survey sites, compared to 1ha recorded by LCM2007  (equivalent to 0%). Taking into account BHA increases the correspondence to 48%,  with the other main mismatches being with „Improved Grassland‟, „Dwarf Shrub  Heath‟ and „Bog‟. From a remote sensing perspective „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟ is  problematic as it is can be comprised of a wide range of land cover types and many  patches of Fen are below the LCM2007 MMU. The small size of „Fen, Marsh and  Swamp‟ patches, plus their typically mosaic nature make it difficult to find  representative areas, of sufficient size, to conduct a spectral classification. Soil data  is of limited use in assisting as it shows the historical land cover, so large swathes of  East Anglia have a peaty, fen soil, but subsequent drainage and management have  changed them to arable. Rush-pastures are not an issue as in Countryside Survey  2007 a special point was made of not recording them as „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟  after problems in earlier surveys.     ‘Dwarf Shrub Heath’ - Very similar result to „Acid Grassland‟, with  correspondence between the two data sets 54% at the Broad Habitat level,  increasing to 93% when associated habitats are considered.    ‘Bog’ - Similar to „Acid Grassland‟ and „Dwarf, Shrub Heath‟, with Broad Habitat  correspondence of 37% and BHA correspondence of 96%.      ‘Montane Habitats’ - The areas of „Montane Habitats‟ mapped by the two  surveys have a 76% correspondence at the Broad Habitat level, increasing to 100%  at the BHA-level.    ‘Inland Rock’ - the correspondence between Countryside Survey in 2007 and  LCM2007 „Inland Rock‟ is 21% at the Broad Habitat-level. Most of the difference  between Countryside Survey and LCM2007 is split between the „Acid Grassland‟ and  „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟ classes, which suggest that the mismatch is happening in  upland areas. This is probably due to differences in the proportion of rock required  before the area is classified as „Inland Rock‟ and differences in the structure of the  spatial frameworks.    ‘Saltwater’ - the correspondence at the Broad Habitat level for Saltwater is 30%,  but once littoral coastal classes are included to account for tidal state and 57    freshwater, then the correspondence reaches 95% at the Broad Habitat Association  level.    ‘Freshwater’ - 91% correspondence at the Broad Habitat level.    ‘Supra-littoral Rock’ - 15% correspondence at the Broad Habitat level,  although some of the divergence is because of 9ha which LCM2007 has classified  as „Littoral Rock‟. The other main source of divergence is 15ha that LCM2007 has as  Rough grassland and Countryside Survey has as „Supra-littoral Rock‟, a preliminary  review of some of these areas suggests that they are typically sloping areas at the  top of cliffs, with a mix of rock and rough grassland.    ‘Littoral Rock’ - Countryside Survey identifies 1ha of „Littoral Rock‟ which  LCM2007 maps as „Littoral Sediment‟.    ‘Littoral Sediment’ – ‘Littoral Sediment‟ has a correspondence of 55%  between the two data sets and primarily gets confused with „Supra-littoral Sediment‟.    ‘Built-up Areas and Gardens’ - at the Broad Habitat level there is a 50%  correspondence, however the way Countryside Survey and LCM2007 map urban  areas is different. Countryside Survey counts parcels within the urban boundary as  urban and assigns attributes to give more specific land cover information, whereas  LCM2007 maps based on land cover rather than context. This is important because  woodland, water and grassland within the Countryside Survey urban boundary may  be mapped as urban rather than woodland or water or grassland, as LCM2007  would map it.    4.2.2 Country-level results  The country-specific results (Tables 4.5-4.7) are largely a function of the accuracy in  the GB correspondence table combined with the area of the Broad Habitats in the  different GB countries. Hence, Scotland has the most „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟ and „Bog‟,  both of which show low correspondence at the BH-level, but higher at the BHA-level,  so this is reflected in the Scotland country-level results of 55.6% (Table 4.8) and  80.6% at the BH and BHA-level respectively. The more intensively managed nature  of England underlies the relatively small percentage change from 67% and 75% at  the BH and BHA-levels. The correspondence between the 107 Welsh CS-squares  and LCM2007 is 58.2% at the BH-level, so higher than the equivalent Scottish value  of 55.6%, but produces the lowest BHA value at 72.3% (Table 4.6).  This occurs  because the most common Broad Habitats in Wales, based on the extent recorded  in the CS-squares (sum of columns in Table 4.7), are „Arable and Horticulture‟ and  „Neutral Grassland‟ which are not affected by the BHA. In contrast, the equivalent  two classes for Scotland are „Bog‟ and „Improved Grassland‟ (Table 4.6), both of  which increase in correspondence when the BHA links are considered. 58          Table 4.5.

Green squares correspond at BH-level; orange squares correspond at BHA-level.  Note, „Boundary and Linear Features‟ and „Mosaic‟ features were excluded from analysis; the CS in 2007 values for „Standing Open Water and Canals‟ and „Rivers and Stream‟  were combined to allow comparison with LCM2007, the CS in 2007 values for „Acid Grassland‟ and „Bracken‟ were also combined, as LCM2007 mapping of „Bracken‟ is  dependent upon image timing. 59        Table 4.6.

It also shows the total area  compared and the maximum potential area (number of 1km-squares * 100 (number  of hectares per square)). The percentage of total area compared (calculated from the  maximum potential area and actual area compared) varies as not all 1km-squares  are completely recorded by CS, because:   The square extends beyond the coast - sea is excluded.   Access was not granted to some areas of the squares (affects 1459 ha).   Habitat was recorded by CS as „Mosaic‟, so was excluded from this analysis  (affects 891 ha).   Habitat was recorded as „Boundary and Linear Features‟, so was excluded  from this analysis (affects 68 ha).  The lowest percentage of CS data used in the comparison is for Scotland, with 63%,  probably as the CS „Mosaic‟ class is used most often in the uplands (Figure 4.3b).  Figure 4.3 also shows that areas classified by LCM2007 as „Improved Grassland‟  dominate the „No Access‟ areas. Whether the systematic exclusion of „No Access‟  and „Mosaic‟ areas produces any systematic biases in correspondence is not clear.    Table 4.8. Summary of the number of squares, potential area and actual area in the  comparison between the CS squares and LCM2007, plus the different levels of  correspondence.       GB  England  Scotland   Wales  Number of squares  591  289  195  107  Maximum potential area (ha)  59100  28900  19500  10700  Actual area compared (ha)  41314  21907  12257  7149  Percentage of total area compared (%)  70  75  63  67  Broad Habitats (%)  62  67  56  58  Broad Habitat Association (%)  76  75  81  72      4.2.3 Spatial coverage  The spatial distribution of correspondence at the Broad Habitat (Figure 4.4) and  Broad Habitat Association levels (Figure 4.5) is useful for identifying patterns in high  and low correspondence. Figure 4.4 shows that the correspondence is lower in semi- natural/upland areas where the spatial structure may vary more between the  products and where classes such as „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟ and „Bog‟ may be difficult  to separate. Allowing some flexibility in the correspondences using the BHA rules  (Table 4.1) creates fewer low correspondences and increases the modal class from  51-60% (Broad Habitat correspondence (Fig. 4.4b)) to  91-100% (Broad Habitat  Association correspondence (Fig. 4.5b)). Preliminary analysis of some of the low  correspondence areas suggests that some of the problems are due to grassland  mismatch, in particular, LCM mapping areas as „Improved Grassland‟ and  Countryside Survey mapping areas as other grassland types, however, this will not  be the explanation in all cases and would benefit from further analysis. 62        Figure 4.3. Piechart showing proportions of LCM2007 Aggregate classes for the polygons  categorised by CS as either a) No access or b) Mosaic.    4.3 Extent of Broad Habitats  The Countryside Survey has an established method for calculating National  Estimates of the area of each of the Broad Habitats from the field survey data types.  LCM2007 provides a very different method of estimating these same Broad Habitat  extents, based on extensive mapping of the UK. The comparison in Section 4.1 with  the Countryside Survey squares was based on a very specific spatial comparison of  the LCM2007 and Countryside Survey products. This comparison is based on area  estimates for the UK but does not have a spatial component beyond the reporting of  areas at country-level. Tables 4.8 and 4.9 show the Countryside Survey estimates,  plus 95% confidence limits, and the LCM2007 estimates for the UK and constituent  countries. The results are presented below in three categories depending on the  degree to which the LCM2007 estimates fall within the Countryside Survey upper  and lower certainty limits.    4.3.1 Very similar area estimates   Very similar results are defined as: classes falling within the CS upper and lower  95% confidence limits in every country (Table 4.8).    Very similar area estimates occur for: „Coniferous Woodland‟, Freshwater, „Built-up  Areas and Gardens‟ and „Calcareous Grassland‟ (Table 4.8).    The „Coniferous Woodland‟ result is to be expected as the correspondence analysis  showed strong agreement between the Countryside Survey and LCM2007 data sets,  however, „Calcareous Grassland‟ is more unexpected, as it was one of the classes 63        Figure 4.4.

This discrepancy  highlights the different nature of the correspondence matrix analysis, based on the  field survey squares, and this analysis using the estimates of Broad Habitat cover for  the UK and constituent countries.  In the case of „Calcareous Grassland‟ the answer  may be that LCM2007 mapped the largest areas of „Calcareous Grassland‟ across  the UK, such as Salisbury Plain and the South Downs well, so the overall estimate  coincides with the Countryside Survey estimate.    4.3.2 Similar area estimates  Similar results are defined as: classes falling within the CS upper and lower 95%  confidence limits for the UK (Table 4.9).    Similar area estimates occur for: Broadleaved woodland, „Acid Grassland‟ and  „Inland Rock‟ (Table 4.9).    4.3.2 Dissimilar area estimates  Dissimilar results are defined as: classes falling beyond the CS upper and lower 95%  confidence limits for the UK (Table 4.9).    Dissimilar area estimates occur for: „Arable and Horticulture‟, „Improved Grassland‟,  „Neutral Grassland‟, „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟, „Bog‟, „Montane Habitats‟ and coastal  habitats.    ‘Arable and Horticulture’ - the Countryside Survey estimated area at 46,574km2 is  similar to the 46,090km2 (44,400km2 of arable plus 1,690km2 of horticulture) cited in  DEFRA‟s June Survey of Agriculture and Horticulture for the UK in 2007 (DEFRA,  2011). The LCM2007 „Arable and Horticulture‟ estimate at 63,005km2 exceeds the  Countryside Survey upper limit of 51,276km2. The difference between CS and  LCM2007 is likely to be caused by a combination of the following factors:   Differences in what is classified as „Arable and Horticulture‟ by the two  methods.   Spectral confusion.   Inclusion of „Boundary and Linear Features‟ in the LCM2007 „Arable  and Horticulture‟ area.  Differences in classification of ‘Arable and Horticulture’ - The DEFRA June  Agricultural Census figures suggest that in 2007, there were:  o 44,400km2 of arable crops.  o 1,690km2 of horticultural crops.  o 11,760km2 of temporary grass.  o 5,990km2 of uncropped land.  Together this gives a figure of 63,840km2 for agricultural land, which is close to the  LCM2007 figure of 63,005km2 suggesting that part of the difference between  Countryside Survey and LCM estimates may be due to temporary grass and  uncropped land being included in the LCM „Arable and Horticulture‟ class. This is  likely to be compounded because LCM requires images from several years to 66    produce full UK coverage. One consequence is that increasing the temporal range of  images increases the number of fields changing from temporary grassland to arable  and vice-versa. A field in a summer-winter composite which is grass in one image  and arable in the other image is likely to be classified as arable, because of the  greater spectral variability of this class.      Spectral confusion - The spectral variability of the „Arable and Horticulture‟ habitat  is greater than any of the other classes, due to the wide range of crops and because  growth stages of the same crop can vary between and across images. This can  make it difficult to fully account for all the spectral variability of arable in an image,  which is necessary to produce a good classification of the arable areas. It also  means that any poorly represented spectral signatures are most likely to be  classified as arable, if the image contains substantial arable areas. This may lead to  a tendency to overestimate arable extent in some areas.    Differences in mapping of ‘Boundary and Linear Features’ - Countryside Survey  maps boundary and linear features, but many of these are below the MMU of LCM.  Consequently, in LCM boundary and linear features are incorporated into field  polygons, so an area mapped in Countryside Survey as field-boundary-field, will be  mapped in LCM as field-field. This will tend to increase the size of fields, in  comparison to Countryside Survey, and hence the area mapped as „Arable and  Horticulture‟ or „Improved Grassland‟ by LCM2007. The 5,270km2 estimated for  „Boundary and Linear Features‟ by Countryside Survey is likely to be split in LCM  across the „Arable and Horticulture‟ or „Improved Grassland‟ habitats.    ‘Improved Grassland’ and ‘Neutral Grassland’ - the LCM2007 area for „Improved  Grassland‟ is approximately 10,000km2 more than the Countryside Survey estimate,  whilst the LCM2007 estimate of „Neutral Grassland‟ area is approximately 10,000km2  less than the Countryside Survey estimate. It appears therefore that the difference is  due to how the different products deal with neutral grassland. Spectrally it looks like  „Improved Grassland‟, although in the field survey it may be apparent that the  species composition is characteristic of „Neutral Grassland‟. The soil data is of  limited use in determining whether the grassland will be have the species  composition of „Neutral Grassland‟, or whether it is „Improved Grassland‟ on a neutral  soil.     ‘Dwarf Shrub Heath’ and ‘Bog’ - Similar to the grassland case, the difference in  „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟ and „Bog‟ classes is largely due to allocation between the two  habitats. The extent of LCM2007 „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟ and „Bog‟ is 32,090km2  compared to a value of 31,931km2 for the combined lower confidence limit of  Countryside Survey „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟ and „Bog‟.    Montane and coastal habitats - are poorly represented in Countryside Survey data  (Smart et al., 2010) so it is unsurprising that the area estimates differ for these  classes.    ‘Fen, Marsh and Swamp’ - The CS in 2007 estimate of „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟  area for the UK is 4392km2, with upper and lower confidence limits of 3596km2 and  5189km2 respectively. The LCM20007 estimate is 101km2. „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟  is so different between the two surveys, because Fen is a mosaic of land cover 67    types, so areas mapped as „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟ by CS in 2007, are frequently  mapped as Rough grassland and „Acid Grassland‟ by LCM2007. The small patch  size and different spatial structure of the CS in 2007 and LCM2007 products also  contributes to differences between LCM and Countryside Survey recording of Fen  (see discussion of Fig. 4.1). The QA of „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟ (Section 3.9) is  higher than the comparison against CS in 2007, because the ground reference  polygons are designed to validate LCM2007 and hence the validation polygons  match the LCM2007 polygons spatially and the areas of „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟  are large enough to be detected by LCM2007 methods.     4.3.3 Discussion  This section has focussed on comparing LCM2007 area estimates with those  derived from Countryside Survey. It is important to note that the Countryside Survey  estimates are created by scaling-up using the ITE Land Classes. It is not clear how  much this scaling up affects the estimates; although a sensitivity analysis of the BH  area estimates to the different versions of the ITE Land Classes is currently  underway (Wood et al., in prep.). When LCM2000 data for the Countryside Survey  squares were scaled-up using the Countryside Survey method (to produce UK  estimates) the results were noticeably more similar to the Countryside Survey  estimates than the results based on the LCM2000 mapped areas (Fuller et al.,  2002).       Figure 4.6. Frequency of Fen, Marsh and Swamp polygons recorded by Countryside Survey in  2007 based on a) polygon size and b) total area of polygons for each polygon size class. The  first column in a) and b) is 0-0.49ha and as such is below the LCM2007 MMU.    One final factor to take into account is the influence of Countryside Survey parcels  below the LCM MMU, which are likely to have a significant effect on the area  recorded for some habitats, such as „Broadleaf, Mixed and Yew Woodland‟ and „Fen,  Marsh and Swamp‟ which are often characterised by small parcels within a wider  landscape dominated by other habitats. Figure 4.6 shows that most „Fen, Marsh and  Swamp‟ polygons are below the LCM2007 MMU (Fig. 4.6a) and they account for  33% of the total „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟ area. 68      The impact of Countryside Survey patch size on different habitats has not been  investigated comprehensively, but is likely to show that other habitats also occur  frequently in patch sizes, below the size of the LCM MMU. Understanding the patch  size frequency distributions would be useful in further understanding the relationship  between the LCM and CS data sets.       4.4 UK Land Cover  Summary estimates for UK Land Cover are given in Figure 4.7 (Broad Habitat values  are given in Tables 4.8 and 4.9). LCM2007 shows that for the UK more than 50% is  intensive agriculture („Arable and Horticulture‟ plus „Improved Grassland‟, 51%)) or  developed („Built-up Areas and Gardens‟ (6%)). The remainder is mainly semi- natural, with woodlands covering 12% of the UK - split evenly between Broadleaved  Woodland and Coniferous Woodland. The remaining 30% of the UK is split  between Coastal (1%), Semi-natural grassland and Mountain, heath and bog.    The land cover distribution varies dramatically across the four countries of the UK.  England has the highest proportion of intensive land use at 76% (40% „Arable and  Horticulture‟; 27% „Improved Grassland‟; 9% „Built-up Areas and Gardens‟), followed  by Northern Ireland and Wales with 64% of intensive land use („Improved Grassland‟  and „Arable and Horticulture‟ and „Built-up Areas and Gardens‟). Scotland has the  lowest proportion of intensive land-use with 36%, although it does have the largest  proportion of „Coniferous Woodland‟, which could arguably be seen as an intensive  land-use. The largest proportion of semi-natural areas are in Scotland, with 36%  Mountain, heath and bog and 20% semi-natural grassland. The proportion of  Freshwater varies widely across the four countries from 1% for Wales and England,  2% for Scotland and 4% for Northern Ireland, mainly due to Lough Neagh.    LCM2000 mapped the UK using the same Broad Habitat classes as LCM20007.  Figure 4.8 shows the proportions of land cover based on LCM2000 for the Aggregate  classes. The main differences are that LCM2007 records 26% „Arable‟ and 13%  semi-natural grassland compared to LCM2000‟s values of 23% and 17% for „Arable‟  and semi-natural grassland respectively. Coniferous woodland changes from 5.4%  to 6.1%, whilst Urban is slightly less in LCM2007 than in LCM2000 (5.9% compared  to 6.7%). How much the figures are affected by the changes to the spatial framework  is unclear and how the differences between the two products should be interpreted  requires further analysis. 69    Table 4.8. The coverage (km2) of Broad Habitats from LCM2007 compared with the Countryside Survey in 2007 estimates and the Countryside  Survey upper and lower confidence limits at 95%, for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. CS in 2007 and LCM2007 estimates are in  km2. LCM2007 estimates are highlighted: bold, where LCM2007 estimates fall within Countryside Survey upper and lower limits; red, where they exceed the  Countryside Survey upper limit and blue where they are below the Countryside Survey lower limit.    1. LCM2007 Neutral Grassland estimates include LCM2007 Rough grassland, although this assignment is not ideal as Rough grassland is known to contain a mix of 'Acid  Grassland', 'Calcareous Grassland', 'Neutral Grassland' and some 'Improved Grassland'.  2. Northern Ireland „Montane Habitats‟ is surveyed in a separate montane stratum covering 735 ha so the actual montane habitat area will always be less than this.  3. The Northern Ireland Intertidal Broad Habitats are also in a separate stratum which is analysed separately.  4. Acid Grassland & Bracken, plus the Freshwater class both have CS in 2007 areas and 95% confidence limits derived by adding the BH confidence limits, rather than the  bootstrapping method used to create the BH confidence limits. 70    Table 4.9. The coverage (km2) of Broad Habitats from LCM2007 compared with the Countryside  Survey in 2007 estimates and the Countryside Survey 95% upper and lower confidence limits  for the UK. CS in 2007 and LCM2007 estimates are in km2. LCM2007 estimates are highlighted:  bold, where LCM2007 estimates fall within Countryside Survey upper and lower limits; red, where  they exceed the Countryside Survey upper limit and blue where they are below the Countryside  Survey lower limit.        1. LCM2007 Neutral Grassland estimates include LCM2007 Rough grassland, although this assignment is not  ideal as Rough grassland is known to contain a mix of 'Acid Grassland', 'Calcareous Grassland', 'Neutral  Grassland' and some 'Improved Grassland'. 71          Figure 4.7. Pie charts showing the percentage of Aggregate classes for a) the UK and b)-e) its  constituent countries from LCM2007. 72          Figure 4.8: Pie charts showing the percentage of Aggregate classes for the UK from LCM2000.    4.5 Summary and discussion  Chapter 4 contains two comparisons between LCM and Countryside Survey. The  first comparison was based on the BH mapped in the Countryside Survey 1km  squares and LCM2007, whilst the second was the comparison between Countryside  Survey National Estimates of Broad Habitat extent and LCM2007 estimates. The two  analyses of LCM and Countryside Survey both showed different aspects of the data  sets and demonstrated that:   The level of agreement between LCM2007 and the Countryside Survey data sets  varies widely across the Broad Habitats.   Grassland categories are problematic because of the one-to-many relationship  between the observed land cover of grass and the many Broad Habitats where  grass is part of the habitat. This led to the development of the Broad Habitat  Association rules, which gave a third level of thematic accuracy to assess the  correspondences at, in addition, to the Broad Habitat level and the Aggregate  class level.   LCM2007 shows high correspondence with the area of „Arable and Horticulture‟  mapped by CS in 2007 for the 1km squares, however, as the estimates of Broad  Habitat extent show LCM2007 estimates a much higher „Arable and Horticulture‟  area. Some possible reasons for this are suggested in Section 4.3.    „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟ estimates for the UK vary by an order of magnitude,  between CS in 2007 and LCM2007. This is due to the complex mix of land cover  types that make up Fen areas, making them difficult to identify with spectral  classification, and the small size of many Fen areas. The comparison with the CS  1km squares suggests that a lot of what CS records as Fen and which is large  enough to be mappable by LCM2007 is actually recorded as either Rough  grassland or „Acid Grassland‟. This raises the possibility that future work could  use additional data sets to create a set of KBE‟s to allocate some of these  grassland areas to „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟. 73    Chapter 5: The LCM2007 product range      5.1 Example areas   A series of example areas taken from the LCM2007 vector product are presented in  this section.  A range of geographical areas have been chosen to illustrate the  performance of LCM2007 over a variety of different habitat and landscape types (see  Figure 5.1 for the legend), including upland areas (Figures 5.2 & 5.3), calcareous  (Figure 5.2), urban (Figure 5.4) and arable and fenland (Figure 5.5).

Figure 5.2 shows an area covered by a mixture of upland „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟, „Acid  Grassland‟ and „Bog‟ with the Penllyn Forest to the north and Lake Vyrnwy and Lake  Bala to the south-east and north, respectively. To the south-west the montane ridge  (cyan colour) of Aran Benllyn is apparent. 74    The second example shows a mixture of the „Calcareous Grassland‟ of Salisbury  Plain and its small patches of broadleaved woodland, and the surrounding arable  and „Improved Grassland‟ (Figure 5.3). The suburban towns of Amesbury and  Tidworth can be seen as well as the industrial areas of Boscombe Down airfield in  the south.      Figure 5.3.

Figure 5.7. Diagram to show the available LCM2007 data products    Vector data format   The vector data product is provided as polygons (land parcels) with each parcel  having a list of attributes attached to it. These include its area, source images, Broad  Habitat, and processing details, covering polygon construction, original spectral  classification and KBE history (see Table 5.1).  Note: Broad Habitats sub-classes (BHSub attribute in vector data set: Table 5.1) and  Field Codes (FieldCode attribute in vector data set: Table 5.1) are included in the  vector data set. The BHSub field gives a text description of the FieldCode. Broad  Habitat sub-classes are used in the classification process and identify sub-LCM2007  class land cover types. The Broad Habitat sub-classes are aggregated to produce  LCM2007 classes (see Table 5.2 for details of groupings). Broad Habitat sub-classes  may give additional information, but they are not necessarily recognised with the  accuracy or consistency of LCM2007 classes and Broad Habitats. They are included  in the data set primarily because they are included in the ProbList attribute  (described in Table 5.1), which gives the probability of the top five spectral classes  (named at Broad Habitat sub-class level). It is recommended that users apply their  own validation (for example the method summarised in Appendix 4) before using  data at the Broad Habitat sub-class level if they wish to use it, as it is not covered by  the LCM2007 quality assurance. 79    Raster data format   The raster data have been derived from the vector dataset using the LCM2007 Class  number shown in Table 5.2 and are stored as raster datasets at two different  resolutions:  1. 25m raster, consisting of 23 LCM2007 Classes (Table 5.2).  See Table 5.3 for  metadata.  2. 1km raster (Table 5.3), data derived from the 25m raster dataset and  summarised in two different ways:  A. Percentage values, each 1km pixel provides the percentage cover of a  particular land cover at LCM2007 Class level. Multiple sets of data are  provided, one for each LCM2007Class.   B. Dominant values, each 1km pixel provides data on the dominant  LCM2007 Class at that location.    Table 5.1. Description of the attributes of the LCM2007 vector data set.    Attribute  Description  Parcel_ID  Unique parcel identifier for each parcel, which includes the satellite image the polygon  was derived from. Follows the format: 11853977:c20 where 11853977 is the parcel id  and c20 means the polygon came from composite image c20. Image numbers may  also begin with an „i‟, e.g. i76, which signifies a single-date image. All images are  documented in Appendix 2.  BH  Dominant land cover at Broad Habitat level e.g. Coniferous Woodland  BHSub  Broad Habitat sub-class (Table 5.2). Gives a text description of the FieldCode.  FieldCode  Short text string giving field codes. Note field codes are used in the creation of  LCM2007, but the accuracy of the product at this level is not assessed. The LCM2007  team recommend that these codes are used only if users perform their own validation  on them.  INTCODE  RECOMMENDED FOR DISPLAY. This attribute gives the LCM2007 class as an  integer code from 1-23 (see Table 5.2). Note this is often referred to as LCM2007  class number. It is the class recommended for display and is the class validated by  the QA. This is the class displayed by the ArcGIS .lyr file.  KBE  Knowledge-based enhancement (KBE). Descriptor detailing the processing history of  each segment including the complete list of KBE‟s applied and the change instigated  by the KBE. The KBE notation follows a standard format of 2 or 3 letters followed by a  comma followed by original class and then the new class. E.g.     SL,Gr->Bg  signifies soil correction (SL) changing Rough Grassland to Bog. This would  occur when the polygon was on a bog soil, with no, or only slight, slope.    ALT,Sd->Gr signifies an altitude based correction (ALT) changing sand dune to Rough  Grassland. The change to Rough Grassland would be based on the next spectral class is  in the probability listing, as long as it was not a coastal class.  KBE identifiers:  MC - manual correction; SL - soil correction; CM - coastal mask;   OM - offshore mask; UR - urban mask; ALT - altitude correction  ProbList  The probability of the polygon belonging to a spectral variant class. The attribute lists  the 5 spectral classes that closest match the spectral signature of the polygon   e.g. Gr_d,0.87:Gr_u,0.09:Hga_d,0.04:Gi_n,0.00:Gi_e,0.00 (Table 5.2).  CorePixels  Total number of pixels within the core area of the segment used to perform the  maximum likelihood classification.   Construct  History of the construction of the polygon,    OSMM - Polygon derived from generalised OS Master Map data    OSMM:SEG - Generalised OS Master Map polygon(s) as basis with additional  segmentation    OSMM:AGC:SEG - Generalised OS Master Map polygon with agricultural payment  boundary vectors and segmentation  TotPixels  Total number of pixels in polygon. 80    Table 5.2.

Access to the LCM2007 data sets      The 1km raster data sets are available via the CEH Information Gateway:  https://gateway.ceh.ac.uk      The 25m raster and vector data sets are available under licence from CEH,   please complete the online application on the CEH web site [www.ceh.ac.uk/data]    or contact: spatialdata@ceh.ac.uk for further details.    Please note that licence fees may apply for some users and some applications. 82    Example datasets    LCM2007, like LCM1990 and LCM2000, is produced in a range of data formats and  at a range of thematic and spatial resolutions. This range of products is required to  support a wide range of potential applications. Figure 5.8 shows some examples of  the data sets available for LCM2007 and enables comparison of the level of detail  associated with each product.  Spatially the vector data set and the 25m raster data  set are quite similar, however, the advantage of the vector data set is that each  polygon has a set of metadata attached. The disadvantage of the vector is that this  increases the file size and may make processing unwieldy for some  applications/users. The 25m raster data set may be useful in such circumstances, as  it provides the same land cover detail but without the additional metadata information  and polygon boundaries; this is more appropriate for some applications. The 1km  data sets are typically most appropriate for applications modelling the whole of the  UK at fairly coarse scale and are often combined with additional data sets, such as  meteorological data set or species distribution data. By way of example, the  Broadleaved woodland percentage land cover 1km raster product is shown in  Figure 5.9 - it shows the distribution of broadleaved woodland across the UK.          Figure 5.8.

These products give stock estimates and distributions of Broad  Habitat-based classes for the UK, GB, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern  Ireland. LCM2007 will support a wide-range of environmental applications and a  broad range of users.  LCM2007 has several improvements over the previous CEH land cover maps.  A key  difference is that the spatial structure has been derived from detailed national  cartography (Ordnance Survey MasterMap and LPS Large-scale Vector).  This  enables LCM2007 to readily integrate with other national products and will therefore  increase its uptake and impact. By properly delineating real-world units of land cover,  the spatial framework has enabled a more spatially and thematically accurate  product than has been previously possible. Another major advantage is that the  generalised spatial structure will be re-usable as most of the boundaries in the UK  countryside are relatively static compared to changes in land cover.  This will  increase the efficiency of future national land cover mapping and monitoring  exercises, but more importantly, having a common structure for future land cover  monitoring activities will facilitate accurate change detection.    Change detection  Identifying, quantifying and understanding land cover change and the ecological  effects thereof are essential to meet national and international biodiversity  conservation targets. The three CEH land cover maps would seem an ideal resource  for this.  However, as Chapter 4 demonstrates there are complex issues to be  considered when comparing products with different spatial and thematic structures.  Comber et. al. (2004) have commented on the difficulties of reconciling change  between LCM1990 and LCM2000.    LCM1990 is a pixel based product with 25 bespoke habitat classes.  LCM2000 is a  polygon map based on image segments with habitats related to BAP Broad  Habitats.  LCM1990 and LCM2000 differ thematically and spatially.  LCM2007 is  close to LCM1990 thematically but its spatial structure, coming from generalised  digital cartography, is very different from the previous two.  Clearly comparing CEH  land cover products to detect change will not be straightforward; sophisticated  methods will be required to delineate real changes from those due to error and  methodological differences.  It may be possible to make some progress by looking at  change in aggregated classes (not necessarily the same ones used in the LCM2007  1km products) or by focussing on the most consistently mapped classes or by using  statistical methods that look at the trajectory of change and disregard those that  seem implausible.   However, it is likely that the most useful way forward will be to  re-organise the earlier CEH land cover maps into a common spatial structure based  on real-world units of land use.  The generalised spatial framework from LCM2007  provides this structure. 85      LCM2007 and Countryside Survey    LCM2007 has been produced as part of the Countryside Survey (CS) in 2007  project.  The field survey of CS and LCM2007 are very different conceptually but  complement each other in many ways. The field survey is based on in situ  observations of broad and fine scale habitat features, for a restricted number of field  sites (591 1km x 1km squares in 2007) that are distributed in a stratified random  manner across the UK landscape. Statistical procedures are used to extrapolate field  observations to produce national estimates for the stock and change of Broad  Habitats and it is informative to compare these independent estimates with those  produced by LCM2007 (see Chapter 4). Being based on satellite images there are  some land cover features that LCM2007 cannot resolve that the CS field survey  can.  For example, narrow linear features, such as hedgerows and streams, small  stands of woodland, narrow roads and small dwellings. The CS field survey can also  report on changes in the quality of habitats (e.g. plant species compositions) which is  not possible from satellite imagery. However, LCM2007 uniquely provides coast-to- coast coverage of Broad Habitats across the whole of the UK. It would be  prohibitively expensive and practically impossible to achieve similar coverage using  ground based techniques. Combining in situ and satellite derived information is  essential to advance our understanding of the UK land surface and to develop  optimal strategies for monitoring and managing our land. By considering the  evidence-bases of both approaches together and in conjunction with other data  sources (see below) our understanding of the UK landscape will be greatly  enhanced.     Other sources of information    There are many additional sources of information on UK Land Use/Land Cover.  For  example, the Forestry Commission maintains detailed maps derived from aerial  photography on land used for forestry.  There are readily available European land  cover and land survey products.  For example, Corine Land Cover Maps (1990, 2000  and 2006) derived from satellites, and LUCAS field surveys (2001, 2008 to 2009)  respectively.  Eurostat and the European Environment Agency are planning to roll  out LUCAS, Corine, and five pan-European high resolution land cover layers derived  from satellites every three years. To fully understand what is on the land surface,  sub-surface (soil and geology) and above surface (climate) information is also  useful.  Again the UK is very well placed for this with the British Geological Survey  maintaining detailed geological inventories; the NSRI, the James Hutton Institute and  the AFBI maintaining information on soils; and the Met Office on climate.  Future  land cover monitoring exercises should aim to develop land information systems that  integrate the wealth of information affecting the land surface and present the  resulting knowledge in policy relevant ways.  This will not be easy, but only by doing  so will the UK be able to continue to deliver the socio-economic benefits, supported  by a healthy landscape, and fulfil its conservation objectives. 86    Providing a scientific evidence-base     LCM2007 is a key component in developing a multi-tiered approach to habitat  monitoring, with data at a variety of scales (Earth observation, ecological modelling,  aerial photography, LiDAR and gound survey) being used to inform evidence-based  policy. LCM2007 is the third national-scale digital land cover map produced by CEH  and there have been five Countryside Surveys, between 1978 and 2007.  The UK is  therefore in a very fortunate position.  Nowhere else in the world has such rich  spatial and temporal data on land cover and habitats.  These products provide an  invaluable resource to UK scientists, policy makers and managers.  CEH's LCMs  have been used very widely, for example for the management of natural resources,  urban planning, carbon accounting, flood risk modelling and many more.  Over 600  data licenses have been granted for LCM1990 and LCM2000. A recent literature  search revealed approximately 400 journal publications that have referred to CEH  land cover maps.  Clearly they have had a huge scientific impact and LCM2007 will  continue and enhance this trend.     In conjunction with other data, LCM2007 will be an important evidence-base for  policy and other applications in a many sectors including:  •             Atmosphere & climate      •             Water & catchments  •             Ecosystem service assessment  •             Marine & coastal   •             Ecology & conservation   •             Impact assessment   •             Health & hazards   •             Agriculture  •             Landscape planning   •             Telecommunications   •             Urban studies   •             Statistics, information   •             Education & publicity   •             Carbon accounting    Specific examples of environmental policy areas where LCM2007 may be an  important source of information include:   Providing the most accurate, up-to-date UK land cover map, for use in  biodiversity assessment and tracking landscape change.   Serving as a contextual base map (Broad Habitat level) for higher-resolution  habitat mapping in the biodiversity surveillance strategy.   Enabling habitat network and connectivity analysis to be undertaken, as an  input to biodiversity assessment for policy making (e.g. informing woodland  expansion), biodiversity reporting (e.g. Natura) and 2020 biodiversity target  evaluation.   Providing a consistent UK frame of reference for informing and evaluating  policy, taking account of biogeographical variations and enabling country  comparisons.   Enabling the assessment of the „naturalness‟ of river catchments, as part of a  standard approach to evaluating rivers for conservation. 87    European links    The UK component of the Corine Land Cover 2006 (produced on behalf of the  European Environment Agency) is being derived from the LCM2007 vector product  by a process involving geometric generalisation and thematic transformations.  Corine is a key component of pan-European environmental assessment and  evidence-based policy making.     LCM2007 benefited from the increase in strategic thinking at a European level, with  the European Environment Agency and ESA, amongst others, producing the  IMAGE2006 data set for member countries. IMAGE2006 is a pan-European data set  of SPOT and IRS data, which provides continuous coverage of Europe at two points  in time, to support and build up demand for environmental monitoring based on  satellite data sets with approximately 25m resolution. IMAGE2006 data provided the  core set of data upon which LCM2007 was based.

It can be used to create polygons from a raster data set.    IRS: Indian Remote sensing Satellite. IRS is a satellite carrying the LISS-III and  AWIFS sensors.     Knowledge-based enhancements: Series of rules applied post-classification to aid  the determination of Broad Habitat type.    Landsat: US series of satellite platforms which carry the Thematic Mapper (TM) and  Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) sensors.     LCMGB: Land Cover Map of Great Britain, produced as part of Countryside Survey  in 1990. A pixel-based land cover map produced by semi-automated multi-temporal  classification and simple knowledge-based enhancement. 25m spatial resolution.    LCM2000: Land Cover Map 2000, produced as part of Countryside Survey in 2000.  A segment-based land cover map produced by image segmentation, semi- automated multi-temporal classification and knowledge-based enhancement. 0.5 ha  minimum mappable unit.    LCM2007: Land Cover Map 2007, produced as part of Countryside Survey in 2007.  A parcel-based land cover map, derived from generalised national cartography and  classified using multi-temporal image data, followed by post-classification application  of a suite of knowledge-based enhancements.    LISS-III: Linear Imaging Self Scanner – III, a 23.5 m spatial resolution, four band  pushbroom sensor on the IRS platform.    MasterMap: Ordnance Survey MasterMap (OSMM) - a very detailed cartographic  product for Great Britain.     MIR: Middle infrared.    MFW: Minimum feature width, the narrowest object, or part of an object that can be  mapped within the data set.    MMU: Minimum mappable unit. LCM2007 retains all segments with 9 or more pixels  (on the basis that a 3 x 3 pixel segment can contain a „pure‟ core pixel); segments  with <8 pixels (<0.5 ha in area) are „dissolved‟ into surrounding segments, with each  pixel individually attached to the neighbouring segment which was most similar in  spectral character.    NI: Northern Ireland.    NIR: Near infrared. 90      Object: A polygon in the LCM2007 GIS database.    OS: Ordnance Survey, the UK national mapping agency, responsible for the  production and maintenance of MasterMap.    OSNI: Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland, national mapping agency for Northern  Ireland.    Parcel: A parcel (sometimes called specifically a „land parcel‟) is an area on the  ground, often a field but perhaps with no boundary such as a woodland, a patch of  relatively uniform vegetation (e.g. heath), a built up area, or a water body.    Pre-processing: Early stages of image raster processing, which ensure that  atmospheric and topographic effects are minimised within the data and that the data  is properly geo-referenced. These stages are conducted before the image is  classified.    Producer’s accuracy (and Producer’s correspondence): Correspondence  matrices are often summarised by reporting the User‟s and Producer‟s accuracies.  The Producer‟s accuracy is a measure of how well the classification performed  against the reference data set (in this report: ground reference polygons in Section  3.9, or CS in 2007 polygons in Section 4.2). In this report the term „Producer‟s  accuracy‟ is used in Chapter 3 when LCM2007 is compared to a data set expected  to be of higher accuracy than LCM20007. The term „Producer‟s correspondence‟ is  used in Chapter 4, when LCM2007 is compared to a data set expected to be of  similar accuracy.     Raster: A grid-based data structure used in GIS and image analysis systems.    RPA: Rural Payment Agency, an Executive Agency of the Department for  Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). RPA provides key services for making  rural payments, carrying out rural inspections, and livestock tracing.    Segment: The spectrally-defined aggregation of image pixels into a vector polygon,  held in the GIS database; the term „segment‟ is intended to distinguish the resultant  feature from a „land parcel‟ which refers to the actual feature on the ground. Often,  segments record parcels, but with differences which relate to the underlying 25m  structure of the image.    Spatial framework: Is used to describe the network of polygons that make-up the  LCM2007 and CS in 2007 vector data sets. The spatial frameworks (i.e. the  polygons) vary between the two data sets, in part, due to different minimum  mappable units.     Spectral classes: Cover types with distinct spectral signatures: for example,  „shaded north-facing‟ and „sunlit south-facing‟ are two distinct spectral classes of  „improved grass‟; chalk, clay and peat soil background give different spectral classes  of „wheat‟. Spectral classes may differ according to species content, crop variety, 91    phenology, management practices, atmospheric haze, cloud shadow or any other  factor with an impact on the recorded spectral reflectance.    Spot: Satellite pour l‟Observation de la Terre - French series of satellites. Some data  from SPOT 4 and SPOT 5 were used in LCM2007.    Summer target period: The main growing season for arable crops, from mid-May to  late July in southern Britain, or later in Scotland, excluding May but continuing into  August; 2007 was the first choice year, then 2008 and 2007.    Target period: See ‘Summer target period‟ and „Winter target period‟.    Training: The procedure by which a sample of known cover types is defined in the  image processing system to deduce the spectral characteristics of classes, to form  the basis for automatic extrapolation by the system to classify examples of unknown  land cover.    TM: Thematic Mapper, a sensor on the Landsat 5 satellite, recording visible and  infrared reflectance.     User’s accuracy (and Producer’s correspondence): Correspondence matrices  are often summarised by reporting the User‟s and Producer‟s accuracies. The User‟s  accuracy gives the probability that a pixel classified as a class belongs to that class.   In this report the term „User‟s accuracy‟ is used in Chapter 3 when LCM2007 is  compared to a data set expected to be of higher accuracy than LCM20007. The term  „User‟s correspondence‟ is used in Chapter 4, when LCM2007 is compared to a data  set expected to be of similar accuracy.     UK: United Kingdom, comprising of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  Also includes the outlying islands of Isle of Wight, Anglesey, Isles of Scilly, the  Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland. The UK does not include the Channel Islands and  the Isle of Man.    Vector: A digital line held as a series of x-, y-coordinates in a geographical  information system.

Broadleaved, Mixed and Yew Woodland  This Broad Habitat is characterised by vegetation dominated by trees >5m high  when mature, with tree cover >20%. Scrub (<5 m) requires cover >30% for inclusion  in this Broad Habitat.  It includes stands of both native and non-native broadleaved  trees and yew. Woodlands dominated by coniferous species but with >20% cover by  deciduous species are included in this category.  Areas of fen woodland dominated  by species such as willow (Salix spp.), alder (Alnus glutinosa) or birch (Betula spp.)  are also included.     2. Coniferous Woodland  This Broad Habitat is characterised by vegetation dominated by trees >5m high  when mature, which forms a canopy having a cover of >20%. „Coniferous Woodland‟  includes semi-natural stands and plantations and includes both native and non- native coniferous trees.     3. Boundaries and Linear Features  This Broad Habitat type covers a range of linearly arranged landscape features such  as hedgerows, lines of trees, walls, stone and earth banks, grass strips and dry  ditches. These features are not mapped by LCM2007 as they are generally too  narrow to be reliably captured from the satellite images.  It is included here as its  inclusion in Countryside Survey is relevant for the Comparison between LCM2007  and Countryside Survey in Chapter 4.    4. Arable and Horticulture  This Broad Habitat includes annual crops, perennial crops, woody crops, intensively  managed commercial orchards, commercial horticultural land (such as nurseries,  commercial vegetable plots and commercial flower growing areas), freshly-ploughed  land, annual leys, rotational set-aside and fallow.      5. Improved Grassland  „Improved Grassland‟ is characterised by vegetation dominated by a few fast- growing grasses such as Lolium spp., and also white clover (Trifolium repens), on  fertile, neutral soils.  Improved Grasslands are typically either managed as pasture or  mown regularly for silage production or in non-agricultural contexts for recreation and  amenity purposes.    6. Neutral Grassland  This Broad Habitat type is characterised by vegetation dominated by grasses and  herbs on a range of neutral soils usually with a pH of between 4.5 and 6.5. It 95    includes enclosed dry hay meadows and pastures, together with a range of  grasslands which are periodically inundated with water or permanently moist.    7. Calcareous Grassland  „Calcareous Grassland‟ is characterised by vegetation dominated by grasses and  herbs on shallow, well-drained soils which are rich in bases (principally calcium  carbonate) formed by the weathering of chalk and other types of limestone or base- rich rock. Soil pH tends to be high (>6) although it may be as low as 5.    8. Acid Grassland  „Acid Grassland‟ is characterised by vegetation dominated by grasses and herbs on  a range of lime-deficient soils which have been derived from acidic bedrock or from  superficial deposits such as sands and gravels. Such soils usually have a low base  status, with a pH of <5.5.     9. Bracken   This Broad Habitat type covers areas dominated by a continuous canopy cover of  bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) at the height of the growing season. It does not  include areas with scattered patches of bracken or areas of bracken which are >0.25  ha which are included in the Broad Habitat type with which they are associated.     10. Dwarf Shrub Heath  „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟ is characterised by vegetation that has >25% cover of plant  species from the heath family (ericoids) or dwarf gorse Ulex minor. It generally  occurs on well-drained, nutrient-poor, acid soils.  This habitat type does not include  dwarf shrub dominated vegetation in which species characteristic of peat-forming  vegetation such as cotton-grass Eriophorum spp. and peat-building sphagna are  abundant, or that occurs on deep peat (> 0.5 m) as these are included in the 'Bog'  Broad Habitat type.     11. Fen, Marsh and Swamp  This habitat includes fen, flushes, springs, fen meadows, rush pasture and swamp.  Fens are peatlands which receive water and nutrients from groundwater and surface  run-off, as well as from rainfall. Flushes are associated with lateral water movement,  and springs with localised upwelling of water. Marsh is a general term usually used  to imply waterlogged soil; it is used more specifically here to refer to fen meadows  and rush-pasture communities on mineral soils and shallow peats. Swamps are  characterised by tall emergent vegetation. Reedbeds (i.e. swamps dominated by  stands of common reed Phragmites australis) are also included in this type.  Apart  from rush pasture, examples of this Broad Habitat are relatively rare.    12. Bog   This Broad Habitat type covers wetlands that support vegetation that is usually peat- forming and which receive mineral nutrients principally from precipitation rather than  ground water. This is referred to as ombrotrophic (rain-fed) mire. The Bog Broad 96    Habitat includes ericaceous, herbaceous and mossy swards in areas with a peat  depth >0.5m.    13. Standing Open Water and Canals  This Broad Habitat type includes natural systems such as lakes, meres and pools, as  well as man-made waters such as reservoirs, canals, ponds and gravel pits.    14. Rivers and Streams   The 'Rivers and Streams' Broad Habitat type covers rivers and streams from bank  top to bank top, or where there are no distinctive banks or banks are never  overtopped, it includes the extent of the mean annual flood.    15. Montane  The „Montane Habitats‟ category includes a range of vegetation types that occur  exclusively in the montane zone such as prostrate dwarf shrub heath, snow-bed  communities, sedge and rush heaths, and moss heaths. The distinction between the  sub-montane and montane zone is often blurred and the two usually merge through  a band of transitional vegetation.    16. Inland Rock  This Broad Habitat type covers both natural and artificial exposed rock surfaces  which are >0.25ha, such as inland cliffs, caves, screes and limestone pavements, as  well as various forms of excavations and waste tips such as quarries and quarry  waste.    17. Built-Up Areas and Gardens  This Broad Habitat type covers urban and rural settlements, farm buildings, caravan  parks and other man-made built structures such as industrial estates, retail parks,  waste and derelict ground, urban parkland and urban transport infrastructure. It also  includes domestic gardens and allotments. This type does not include amenity  grassland which should be included in the 'Improved Grassland' category.    18. Supralittoral Rock  „Supralittoral Rock„  occurs above the high water mark, in areas influenced by wave  splash and sea-spray. Features that may be present include vertical rock, boulders,  gullies, ledges and pools, depending on the wave exposure of the site and its  geology.    19. Supralittoral Sediment  „Supralittoral Sediment‟ occurs above the high water mark, but in areas influenced by  wave splash and sea-spray. Includes shingle beaches, sand dunes and machair.    20. Littoral Rock  The geology and wave exposure of the shore influence the form of Littoral Rock  habitats, which can be as varied as vertical rock, shore platforms, boulder shores, or 97    rocky reefs surrounded by areas of sediment. In general, „Littoral Rock‟ tends to be  colonised by algae in wave-sheltered conditions, and by limpets, barnacles and  mussels as wave-exposure increases.    21. Littoral Sediment  Areas of „Littoral Sediment„  are widespread around the UK forming features such as  beaches, sand banks, and intertidal mudflats. A large proportion of this habitat  occurs in estuaries and inlets where it can cover extensive areas. Saltmarsh is  included within this Broad Habitat.    22. Inshore Sublittoral Sediment  All areas of sea and estuary class are assumed to be „Inshore Sublittoral Sediment‟.   It is defined as within six nautical miles of the shoreline by JNCC. 98    Appendix 2: Satellite Images    Table 1: The complete list of images pre-processed for LCM2007.

4: Bespoke validation    There is no absolute truth in geography and the “quality” of any geographical  “product” (such as a land cover map) depends on the use to which it is put. The  purpose of an accuracy assessment ought to be whether the product is “fit for  purpose”, in this case will using the LCM2007 lead to a better result than if it is not  used? Unfortunately, we can not anticipate all the possible uses that the land cover  map might be put to; therefore we can only supply a general assessment in terms of  comparisons with various field surveys (which are themselves subject to similar  levels of inconsistencies).     An unusual and very useful feature of the LCM2007 (and its predecessor the  LCM2000) is that it provides parcel level metadata. This means that for all parcels  we know what (if any) KBE have been applied and the probability of the 5 most likely  land cover variants for that parcel (before any KBE has been applied). This metadata  can be mined to allow a user to examine the quality of the categories that are  relevant to their study in their location (as the quality of the imagery varies from place  to place). In essence the proposed methodology make use of high resolution  imagery, (such as that found on GoogleEarth or similar product) to decide whether  the LCM2007 attribution is consistent with the imagery. This can be considered as  an informal Bayesian approach. It is not always possibly to be definitive as to  whether the image is consistent with the LCM2007, so it is suggested that multiple  “fuzzy” categories, such as: “plausible”, “probably”, “possibly”, are used. Doing so  allows an upper and lower estimate to be made on the accuracy of each target class.  The methodology suggests assessing each target classes (relevant to your study) in  two parts; parcels with a high probability of belonging to the class and those with a  moderate probability. A research tool based on Python scripts has been developed. 110    Appendix 5: Broad Habitat Association (BHA)    This Appendix summarises the rationale behind the Broad Habitat Association rules  (shown in Table 4.1) on a class-by-class basis.    Bog  Issue: „Bog‟ forms part of an ecological continuum covering „Acid Grassland‟, „Dwarf  Shrub Heath‟ and some types of „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟ and the separation of  these habitats can be difficult, as the surface vegetation (i.e. land cover) maybe very  similar and the division rests on the depth of peat. The division in the field can  account for species presence, plus peat depth, but for LCM2007 the division is  based on soil data sets.   Rule: LCM classifications of „Bog‟ provide an acceptable correspondence, with CS  classifications of „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟, „Acid Grassland‟, and „Montane Habitats‟. This  rule is reciprocal, so LCM classifications of „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟, „Acid Grassland‟  and „Montane Habitats‟ are an acceptable correspondence with CS classifications of  „Bog‟.     Dwarf Shrub Heath  Issue Upland environments containing „Acid Grassland‟ and „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟  may form an ecological continuum from one habitat to another, or a mosaic of both  habitats. In such cases it is then difficult to separate the area into discrete polygons  of „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟ or „Acid Grassland‟. The comparison between LCM2007 and  CS in 2007 is further compounded by differences in the spatial structure of the two  products. The spatial structure affects transitional classes as the size of the polygon  affects the proportion of heather and gorse to acid grassland, which determines  whether the polygon is classified as „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟ (> 25% of heather or dwarf  gorse), or „Acid Grassland‟ (<25% heather or gorse).  Rule: LCM2007 „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟ is acceptable correspondence with CS “Acid  grassland” and reciprocally LCM2007 “Acid grassland” is acceptable for CS „Dwarf  Shrub Heath‟.    Montane Habitats  Issue: LCM2007 classifies upland areas based on spectral characteristics, after  which a KBE is applied to identify montane areas on the basis of altitude and the  presence of vegetation. „Montane Habitats‟ thus replaces polygons which would  otherwise be classified as „Acid Grassland‟, „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟ and „Bog‟. In most  cases this works well, but LCM2007 is unable to separate areas above the montane  threshold which are genuinely „Dwarf Shrub Heath‟, „Bog‟ or „Acid Grassland‟, rather  than „Montane Habitats‟.  Rule: An LCM2007 classification of „Montane Habitats‟ is an acceptable  correspondence, at the BH adjacency level, with CS classifications of „Dwarf Shrub  Heath‟, „Acid Grassland‟ and „Bog‟. This rule is reciprocal, as LCM2007 will not  record any montane below the montane height threshold.    Built up Areas and Gardens  Issue: LCM2007 allows a variety of land cover types to occur within the urban  boundary, whereas CS map polygons as urban, but attach other attributes, which 111    may identify the land cover type as water, grassland, woodland. In CS areas of  grassland > 1ha are mapped as improved grassland, if occurring with an urban area.  Rule: when CS has recorded a parcel as „Built-up Areas and Gardens‟ it forms an  acceptable correspondence if LCM has recognised the same parcel as being  grassland, woodland or  water. This is not reciprocal.    ‘Fen, Marsh and Swamp’  Issue: „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟ is characterised by a variety of vegetation types and  land cover types, which are often found in a mosaic. This causes 2 problems for a  spectral classification: first, parcel-based spectral classifications perform poorly with  polygons of mixed land cover. Second, if the „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟ is large then it  may cover several polygons, which may be classified as Freshwater, „Neutral  Grassland‟, Rough grassland, „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟ and scrub (falls into the  Broadleaved woodland class).   Rule: if LCM has recorded the polygon as Freshwater, Acid grassland, Rough  grassland,  and  Broad-leaved  woodland  then  it  forms  an  acceptable  correspondence if CS has recorded „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟. This is not reciprocal.    Rough grassland  Issue: The LCM2007 class Rough grassland contains low productivity „Improved  Grassland‟ and acid, neutral and calcareous grassland, which could not be assigned  with confidence to specific grassland Broad Habitats. For the purposes of Broad  Habitat comparison it is nominally assigned to the „Neutral grassland’ class (as in  LCM2000, see Fuller et al., 2002), however for the Broad Habitat Association  correspondence it is more appropriate to accept that it contains contributions from a  range of grassland BH.  Rule: accept LCM2007 Rough grassland if it corresponds with „Improved  Grassland‟ and Acid, Neutral or Calcareous grasslands or „Fen, Marsh and Swamp‟.    Water classes  Issue: LCM2007 maps water, with assignment to Saltwater or Freshwater based  on spatial context.   Rule: LCM2007 Saltwater or Freshwater are a suitable correspondence with all CS  water classes. This rule is not reciprocal.    Tidal areas  Issue: the tidal position at the time of satellite data acquisition or field survey affects  the mapping of the saltwater and „Littoral Rock‟ and sediment classes.  Rule: LCM2007 Saltwater and CS „Littoral Rock‟ and sediment are acceptable  correspondences. This rule is reciprocal. 112                Text and maps in this publication are the copyright of the Natural Environment Research Council  unless otherwise stated and may not be reproduced without permission. © NERC (CEH) 2011.

Getting the most from Countryside Survey data Notes on the downloadable data To help preserve their representativeness of the wider countryside, the precise locations of CS survey squares is held in confidence by UKCEH. It has been agreed that the locations of squares will not be identified to external users with any greater precision than 100 square km. It is therefore not possible for users to identify whether or not any survey squares fall within defined areas below this threshold.  Sampling Considerations in the use of Countryside Survey Data Countryside Survey (CS) Field Survey data comprise information collected from a sample of 1 km squares in GB. Each selected square is mapped and detailed measurements made of selected features, for example a number of quadrats are laid out and used to collect additional information on vegetation, soils etc. Thus there are two levels of sampling, whole square and within-square. Measurements are made at both levels so that some characterise the square while others describe features within the square. Measurements are of varied types ranging from binary (yes/no) variables to continuous variables such as areas or lengths. CS sample squares are not a random subset of the set of all squares in GB and this has implications for any analyses. Most importantly the sample is a stratified one with sub-samples of squares selected within designated strata. The strata used for square selection are defined by the ITE Land Classification. The details of the classification have changed somewhat from its original form, largely as a result of the need for separate country reporting. Originally the classification comprised 32 Land Classes. In 1998, due to the requirement for separate reporting in Scotland, the classification was modified to contain 42 classes. In 2007 the requirement for Wales only reporting led to further revision of the classification resulting in 45 land classes. Effectively each country now has a separate classification, 21 classes in England, 8 in Wales and 16 in Scotland. Estimates derived from CS data without taking account of the stratification may not be representative and will have inaccurate estimates of variation. An additional complication associated with the sampling procedure is that not all squares in GB were considered for field survey. Any square whose area, as measured from 1:250000 scale OS maps, was more than 90% sea or more than 75% urban was excluded from survey (see Countryside Survey 1990 Main Report (Barr et al., 1993) for exact details). Strictly speaking the field survey data is only representative of the squares in GB that meet the above criteria. In practice estimates for the whole of GB, or regions of it, are made under the assumption that vegetative land in excluded squares is similar in composition to that in the sampled squares. Although this is unlikely to be completely true the total amount of land concerned is very small and the resulting bias likely to be negligible in general. Only if a region under consideration contains a high proportion of sea or urban squares is a problem likely to occur. As a result of this sampling design, official estimates from CS are produced by calculating ratio estimates (Cochran, 1963) for each land class, taking into account the area of vegetative land in each sample square. Land class estimates are then combined using as weights the area of vegetative land in each land class as a whole. From 1998, because of concerns about the skewness of some of the features being estimated, standard errors and confidence intervals have been estimated using the bootstrap (Efron and Tibshirani,1993).

Information about the project    With the CINAg project we propose to meet the needs of China and the UK to optimise farm  practices and soil management to make more effective use of different nitrogen sources and  reduce losses of Nr to the environment, thus mitigating against environmental impacts  associated with this loss.    The project objectives are:    1. Develop novel indicators of N use efficiency (NUE) and to combine these with other  new real-time physical and chemical metrics to obtain holistic metrics of soil health and  quality which informs farm practices and soil management to deliver improved  agronomic NUE and sustainable crop production.  2. Use these indicators and other emerging knowledge to test and develop on field  experiments and farm platforms, farm systems that permit the sustainable  intensification of agriculture.   3. Translate these developments to Chinese farmers using the proven ‘Science and  Technology Backyard’ programme developed by CAU and CAAS that is moving  farmers out of poverty and enriching whole communities.     The Project was structured into the following work packages to address the above objectives    1. WP1. Improved fundamental understanding of N cycling  2. WP2. Harnessing novel N technologies   3. WP3. Improved agronomic practices   4. WP4. Predictive capacity and knowledge exchange 4  3. Information on experimental farm platforms and cross-UK sites    3.1 Locations of farm platforms and cross-UK sites  Fertiliser experiments were conducted at four farm platforms across the United Kingdom (UK)  in 2016 and 2017 (Figure 1).

Water filled pore space was  calculated using soil bulk density and soil moisture readings from 10 (HF) and 5 (NW) SDI-12  soil moisture sensors (Acclima Inc., USA) at 2.5 cm depth.   At the EB site, soil temperature and water filled pore space (WFPS %) were measured using  handheld probes (31/162/0, Brannan,UK & Hydrosense II, Campbell Scientific, UT, US)  simultaneously when chamber measurements were carried out. Long term meteorological and  soil measurements were recorded at the permanent Easter Bush measurement station which  was situated at the edge of the Engineer’s Field. This station provided measurements of air  temperature (1.8 m), soil temperature (0.3 m depth) and rainfall (tipping bucket) at 30 min  intervals throughout the measurement campaigns. 8  4. Experimental information    Two multi-platform experiments were carried out in 2016 and 2017, respectively. In 2016  inorganic fertiliser trials were performed on grassland across the NW, HF and EB sites. In  2017 a digestate trial was performed on winter wheat at NW and HF. In 2017, additional  grassland trials were performed at EB and HA.    4.1 Inorganic fertiliser experiments (grass trials) - 2016 (and 2017 for EB)    The NW, HF and EB sites were managed as a three-cut silage system with a total N- application of 240 kg nitrogen per ha. A complete randomized block design was applied at NW  and HF (see appendix), and EB with four control (C) plots and four replicates for each fertiliser  treatment:   1) Urea only (U, N-content ~ 46%) - urea pellets  2) Urea and urea inhibitor (IU), urea pellets with coating of powdered urease inhibitor  (Agrotain®)  3) Ammonium-nitrate (AN, N-content ~36%) - nitrate pellets: Nitram, NH4+NO3-  4) Control plots  All 16 plots received P, K, and S in accordance with national fertiliser guidelines as published  by Defra 2010. All fertilisers were added manually and applications rates and dates are  detailed in the Appendix in Tables A1 and A2.  At the NW and HF sites all plots were divided into three sub-plots:  1) 4 m x 2 m subplot designated for NH3 emission measurements  2) 2 m x 2 m subplot designated for soil sampling and N2O emission measurements  3) 6 m x 2 m subplot designated for biomass harvesting for yield and yield quality  measurements.  At the EB site in 2016, all plots were 2 m x 8 m with 0.5 m spacing between them  1) a 1 m x 1 m subplot designated for biomass harvesting for yield and yield quality  measurements  At the EB site in 2017, plots were arranged in a square grid of an area 20 m x 20 m. There  was not spacing between the treatment plots. Treatments were assigned randomly. The  experimental design for the HA site in 2017 is detailed elsewhere.                    © Photo by A. Carswell: Fertiliser application at North Wyke. 9  4.2 Digestate experiment (winter wheat) -2017    A complete randomized block design was implemented at the NW and HF sites (see  Appendix Figures A1 and A2) with five control plots and five replicates for each digestate  treatment:     1) Digestate only,   2) Digestate and nitrification inhibitor (DMPP - 2 litre per ha),   3) Acidified digestate acidified in 1 m3 tanks  4) Acidified digestate with nitrification inhibitor (DMPP - 2 litre per ha)  5) Control plots    © Photos by A. Carswell: Digestate application to winter wheat (left) and treatment differences (right) at North  Wyke.  All 25 plots were divided into two subplots:  1) Harvest subplot: NW 4.5 x 2 m and HF 6.5 x 1.2 m  2) Sampling subplot: NW 4.5 x 2 m and HF 7.5 x 1.2 m    All treatments were investigated as part of WP2, whereas the control treatment, digestate only  and the acidified digestate with nitrification inhibitor were sampled for WP1 (n = 15 plots).    The target application rate was 190 kg nitrogen per ha as digestate, but application rates  varied in the field. The digestate was manually band-spread in parallel with the crop rows at a  rate of 40 m3 per ha using 20 litre capacity watering cans. Digestate was applied on 20th March  2017 at NW, and on 19th April at HF.    4.3 UK wide sampling - 2018  In 2018, sites with different land uses and soil types were visited across the UK (Figure 2,  Table 3). Some sites that were part of the UGRASS project (https://www.soilsecurity.org/u- grass/) were re-visited sites for soil sampling and the measurement of aboveground biomass  productivity. 10  5. Protocols and data processing    Sampling protocols and sample dates differ slightly for the measurements taken for WP1 and  WP2. If so, sampling protocols below were clearly separated into measurements carried out  for WP1 and WP2 respectively. All treatment plots were sampled the same day within a site.  Sampling days varied across site due to different weather conditions at each site and the effect  this had on plant growth. Crops were harvested after a full growing season as advised by the  farm managers.    5.1 Yields (herbage production and quality) and biomass production    Measured by Rothamsted Research and Bangor University for NW and HF, respectively.  Measured by CEH Edinburgh for EB; measured by CEH Bangor for 2018 sampling.  Units: Dry matter yields - yield of dry grass in tonnes per hectare,  acid detergent fibre - g  nitrogen per kg, total mineral content - g per kg, protein content - g per kg, metabolisable  energy - MJ per kg, Neutral detergent fibre - MJ per kg, D value (digestibility metric) - percent.    Inorganic fertiliser (grass) experiment (2016). Three silage cuts were performed at each  site (see dates in Appendix Table A1). At the HF site a 1.27 m strip was cut down the centre  of each harvest subplot to a residual height of 5 cm. The cut herbage was collected, weighed  and total fresh weight was determined. Representative sub-samples of approximately 200 g  were collected, dried at 80°C for 72 h, and their dry weight was determined. This measure  was used to upscale dry weight of yield to total dry yields, and to convert yield dry matter to a  m2 basis.    Dried herbage samples were analysed for herbage quality, including crude protein (CP),  metabolisable energy (ME), non-digestible fibre, acid digestible fibre and dry matter (DM)  using near infra-red spectrometry (NIRs; by Sciantec Analytical Laboratories, Stockbridge  Technology Centre, York, UK). Digestibility (D, %) was determined according to Beever et al.  (2000) as:  D = ME / 0.16  At the NW site, a 1.5 m strip was cut down the centre of each harvest subplot to a residual  height of 5 cm and the fresh herbage weighed immediately using a Haldrup small plot  harvester. Representative subsamples of approximately 2 kg were taken manually and  analysed for the same herbage quality analyses as described for HF (also via NIRs; by Trouw  Nutrition GB, Blenheim House, Ashbourne, UK).    At the EB site in 2016, a 1 m2 subplot was cut using sheers and the fresh yield was recorded.  Subsamples (200 grams) were then taken from each plot for the analysis of dry matter content,  ME, CP, modified acid detergent (MAD), digestability (D value), total carbon and total nitrogen  content at SRUC Analytical Services (Midlothian, UK). The same herbage parameters were  measured at the EB site in 2017 but the harvest was carried out using a small harvester with  on-board weighing capabilities (Haldrup F-55). A total area of 30 m2 was harvested. Each of  the plots was harvested and above-ground biomass was dried at 60 oC for 24 hours and both  fresh and dry weights were recorded.    Digestate (winter wheat) experiment (2017). One harvest was performed at each site at the  end of the experiment. At the HF site quadrats of 0.4 x 0.4 m were harvested 2 cm above the  ground for all plots. Grain and straw were separated by hand and the fresh weight was  determined. 11    At the NW site, a Sampo small-plot combine harvester was used to harvest the wheat,  separating the grain and straw, which were weighed. A sub-sample from each plot was used  to determine grain weight and dry matter biomass.  © Photos by A. Carswell: Grass harvest (left) and winter wheat harvest (right) at North Wyke.  UK wide sampling (2018). Annual plant biomass production was assessed using grazing  exclusion cages for actively grazed sites (Table 3). Silwood, Harpenden and Easter Bush are  experiments and no exclusion cages were needed. Biomass estimates were provided by  partners. Sites were visited in spring, and re-visited in late summer/autumn. The vegetation  phase of the grass was particularly short in 2018 due to warm and dry weather.    Before cages (60 cm x 60 cm x 60 cm) were randomly deployed across fields, vegetation was  cut back to the ground with gardening scissors. Cages were anchored in the soil using at least  four tent pegs, one in each corner. Unfortunately, anchoring in many cases for was not strong  enough and cages were moved or destroyed by animals in the field and windy conditions. At  the boggy Plynlimon site, moss meshes were deployed to assess moss growth over one year.  For a more thorough biomass assessment in grasslands (and other ecosystems) we refer to  the supporting documentation of Smart et al. (2017).    In late summer/autumn, vegetation of the 60 cm x 60 cm area was cut inside the cage area.  Biomass was dried at 65oC and dry biomass was determined. Biomass production was  expressed as g dry biomass per m2 per year.    5.2 Wheat N content, N offtake and N use efficiency    Measured by Rothamsted Research and Bangor University for NW and HF, respectively.  Measured by CEH Bangor for EB.  Units: Herbage nitrogen content - kg nitrogen per hectare, nitrogen offtake - kg nitrogen per  hectare, nitrogen use efficiency - percent.    For the NW and HF sites in 2016, N content in the grass was calculated from the crude  protein results using a factor of 6.25. The value of 6.25 is a standard value and is the  multiplication factor the contracted labs used to gain crude protein content from their total N  analyses,  this  value  was  used  to  back-convert  to  total  N  content  (http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/y5022e/y5022e03.htm). Herbage N offtake (N-off) was then  calculated as:  N-off = Ncontent × yield 12  where Ncontent is the nitrogen content of the grass as a percentage and yield is the grass  offtake from each plot (kg dry matter ha-1).  For the NW and HF sites in 2017, grain and plant production were estimated from the ‘harvest  area’ of each plot at the end of the experiment. At the HF site, wheat plants from three 0.4 ×  0.4 m quadrats were harvested 2 cm above the ground and grain and straw were separated  by hand and weighed. At the NW site, a Sampo small-plot combine harvester was used to  harvest the wheat, separating the grain and straw, which were weighed.    A sub-sample from each plot was used to determine grain and straw moisture. Total N was  analysed using a TruSpec® analyser (Leco Corp., St Joseph, MI) from ground oven-dried  plant tissue (80 °C, 24 h); N offtake by the total crop was calculated by multiplying the N  content of the grain and the straw by the grain and straw yield, respectively. Thousand-grain  weight (TGW) was determined by weighing 1,000 oven-dried grains. Grain yield, straw yield  and TGW are reported at 85 % dry matter.    Nitrogen Use Efficiency of the crop (total for grain and straw, NUEc) and grain (NUEg) were  calculated as:  NUEc = (Nt – Nc) / Napplied × 100,  NUEg = (Nt – Nc) / Napplied × 100,  where Nt is the crop and grain N offtake from N (digestate or NH4NO3) treatment plots, Nc is  the mean crop and grain N offtake from the control plots and Napplied is the N fertiliser applied  to the plots.    For the EB site, total N in the harvested crop was analysed at SAC services (Midlothian) using  the Kjedahl digestion method. After oven drying sub-samples of the crop at 80 °C for 24 hours,  NUE was calculated as the mean total N content in the harvested crop from four plots, minus  the mean total nitrogen content of the control plots, divided by the total N applied as fertiliser  (same equation as above).      5.3 Sampling of greenhouse gases: Ammonia and nitrous oxide    Measured by Rothamsted Research and Bangor University for NW and HF, respectively.  Measured by CEH Bangor for EB.  Units: Ammonia emission rate - kg NH3-N per hectare per day, nitrous oxide - μg N2O-N per  m2 per hour.    Ammonia emissions. Ammonia volatilization was measured using a system of small wind  tunnels (Misselbrook et al. 2005) at the NW and HF sites. For the 2016 inorganic fertiliser  trials at HF and NW wind tunnel constructions were run continuously for three weeks following  each inorganic fertiliser application, with 0.02 M H3PO4 acid traps (100 mL) changed daily.  Wind tunnels were moved daily to one of three positions, with a return to position one on the  fourth day. This was carried out to minimize the impact of the tunnel canopy on the plot area.  For the digestate experiment (2017), traps were changed three times at NW and twice at HF  on the first day after digestate application, because high rates of ammonia volatilization were  expected. Following the first day the acid traps were changed daily until the end of the 7-day  sampling period. Wind tunnels remained in the same position over the 7-day period for the  digestate experiment. Ammonia fluxes from the measurement area (FNH3, μg m-2 s-1) were  determined for each measurement period using: 13    FNH3 = (Co – Ci) v/t  where Co and Ci are the NH3-N concentrations (μg NH3-N m-3) at the tunnel outlet and inlet,  respectively, and v is the air volume (m3) drawn through the wind tunnel over the sampling  period (t, s).                      © Picture by A. Carswell: Wind tunnels for measuring ammonia emissions   on winter wheat at North Wyke.    During the inorganic fertiliser experiments at the NW site, NH3 emissions were measured from  the AN, IU and U treatments (n = 4), whereas at HF, measurements were conducted from the  U and IU treatments only (n = 3 for the first N application, n = 4 for the second and third N  applications).    For both the inorganic fertiliser and the digestate experiments, the acid trap samples were  taken from the field, topped up to 100 mL with deionized H2O and a subsample was taken and  stored at 4°C (NW) or -18°C (HF) prior to colorimetric analysis (Mulvaney 1996) for the  inorganic fertiliser experiment in 2016.    For the inorganic fertiliser experiments, cumulative NH3 emissions were calculated for each  plot for the three N-application periods using the area under a curve function “cumtrapz()” from  the “pracma” package (Borchers 2016) in R (version 3.3.2; R Core Team, 2016).  For the digestate experiment (2017), N-loss through NH3 volatilization was expressed as a  percentage of the total N applied for each treatment to normalize for the different N application  rates.    At the EB site, NH3 fluxes were only measured as part of the grassland trial in 2017. Fluxes  of NH3 were derived using the FIDES inverse dispersion model (Loubet et al. 2017). The basis  of the model is the solution of the advection-diffusion equation by Philip 1959, assuming power  law profiles for the wind speed (U(z)) and the vertical diffusity (Kz(z)). Furthermore, the model  assumes no chemical reactions in the atmosphere over the time scales relevant in our case,  and that roughness length, wind speed and vertical and lateral diffusivity are spatially  homogenous. More details on the dispersion model is given in Huang (1979). Following these  assumptions, as expressed by  ܺ௠௢ௗ௘௟ ሺݔ, ݕ, ݖሻൌܺ௕௚ௗ൅׬௔௟௟ ௫ೞ ௔௡ௗ ௬ೄܵሺݔ௦, ݕ௦, ݖ௦ ሻܦሺݔ௦, ݕ௦, ݖ௦ |ݔ, ݕ, ݖሻ,  the model assumes that the atmospheric NH3 concentration (X in µg NH3 m-3) in a given point  is the sum of the background concentration (Xbgd in µg NH3 m-3) unaffected by the sources,  and the influence of the sources. Latter is equal to all the source strengths per unit surface (S  in µg NH3 m-2 s-1) in the locations (xs, ys, zs) multiplied by the dispersion function  ܦሺݔ௦, ݕ௦, ݖ௦|ݔ, ݕ, ݖሻ in s m-1 which expresses the contribution of each source to each receptor 14  point in which the concentration c is considered. The meaning of ܦሺݔ௦, ݕ௦, ݖ௦|ݔ, ݕ, ݖሻ can be  viewed simply as the concentration at location (x,y,z)  for a source of unit strength at location  ሺݔ௦, ݕ௦, ݖ௦ሻ.    In order to calculate S, D was computed by the model, and both X and Xbgd were measured.  To calculate D, the description of Philips (1959) was followed using the equations:  ܷሺݖሻൌܽݖ௣ and ܭ௭ ሺݖሻൌܾݖ௡  Here, the values of a, b, p and n are derived from a linear regression between ln(U), ln(Kz)  and ln(z), over the height range 2 × z0 to 20 m, using U(z) and Kz(z) estimated based on the  Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (see, e.g. Kaimal & Finnigan, 1994), where z0 denotes the  roughness length.  ܦሺܺ, ܻ, ݖሻൌ1/ሺߪ௬ √2ߨሻ ݁ݔ݌ሺെ ଶ/ሺ2ߪ_ݕଶ ሻሻൈሺݖݖ௦ሺଵି௡ሻ/ଶሻ/ܾܽܺൈ݁ݔ݌ሺെሺܽሺݖఈ ൅ݖ௦ఈሻሻ/ሺܾܽଶ ܺሻሻൈܫି௩ ሺሺ2ܽሺݖݖ௦ሻఈ/ଶሻ/ሺܾܽଶ ܺሻሻ  where X = (x − xs) sin(WD) − (y − ys) cos(WD), and Y = (x − xs)cos(WD) − (y − ys) sin(WD),  where WD is the wind direction; α = 2 + p − n, ν = (1 − n)/α, and I−ν is the modified Bessel  function of the first kind of order −ν. Finally, Cy and m are parameters taken from Sutton (1932)  in the equation:  ߪ௬ൌሺ1/√2ሻ ܥ௬ ݔሺଶି௠/ଶሻ  Wind data were recorded by two sonic anemometers (IRGASON, Campbell Scientific, UT,  USA) which were positioned at the north east and south west sides of the plots, 30 m from the  borders of the plots in alignment with the two wind predominant wind directions. The  anemometers measured 3D wind components at 10 Hz. Following Loubet et al. (2001), the  source height was tuned to zs = 1.01 z0 + d, where d is the displacement height, in order to  insure best comparison with Lagrangian Stochastic models and experiments (see also Loubet  at al. 2010). The dispersion model embedded in FIDES is essentially similar to the Kormann  and Meixner (2001) footprint model, except for the retrieval of the a, b, p, n parameters which  are here inferred by fitting the wind speed and diffusivity profiles over a height range 0.2-20 m  while in Kormann and Meixner (2001) it was computed by forcing the profiles at a reference  height. The FIDES model was shown to behave similarly to a Lagrangian Stochastic model in  Loubet et al. (2018).    For the concentration measurements, Alpha passive air samplers (Tang et al., 2001) were  used. These samplers are small hollow plastic tubes (27 mm ID) with a PTFE membrane which  allows air to pass through. Inside there is a layer of filter paper coated in citric acid which traps  atmospheric NH3 and hold it in place within the sampler. This method enabled us to measure  cumulative NH3 concentrations at a fixed point, integrated over a certain period of time (t)  several hours or days can be determined. To observe χmeas, duplicate samplers were  positioned at the centre of the 16 treatment plots (20 m by 20 m) at heights of 30 cm and 50  cm. In order to measure χbgd, samplers were installed in triplicate at the four edges of the  experimental grid, 30 m away from the plots. Samplers were placed immediately before  fertilisation and removed/replaced 0.25, 1, 2, 3, 7 and 14 days after fertilisation. Samplers  were stored at 4 °C after collection before extraction by deionised water and analysis using  Ammonia Flow Injection Analysis (AMFIA, CEH Edinburgh, UK).    The source strength S of each plot was computed by least square optimisation of means  against mod, using the linear model function lm in R (package stats, R version 3.2.3), as  described in details in Loubet et al. (2017). The method was shown to be slightly negatively  biased (-16% on average) under moderately oceanic meteorological situations. 15  Nitrous oxide emissions. At the NW site, N2O emissions were measured on each plot (n =  4), using static manual chambers. At the HF site, a combination of static manual and static  automatic chambers (combined with an Isotopic N2O Analyser, Los Gatos Research Inc. San  Jose, CA, USA) was used. Following the first N application at HF, fluxes from the control  treatment were measured using static manual chambers, whereas static automatic chambers  were used for all other treatments (n = 4 for each treatment). For the second and third N- applications at HF, only static automatic chambers were used across all treatments.  Measurement replication was thus reduced to three of the four experimental blocks (n = 3 for  each treatment).    Where manual chambers were used, chambers (50 × 50 × 30 cm) were inserted into slots cut  so that they projected 15 to 20 cm above the soil surface. Soil was packed around the outside  of the chambers to ensure an air-tight seal. Chambers were installed two weeks prior to the  start of the experiment, removed prior to silage/herbage cutting events and replaced  immediately after. Following fertiliser application, N2O sampling from the manual chambers  was performed three times weekly for the first and second weeks, twice weekly for the third  and fourth weeks, and once weekly thereafter. Sampling was carried out between 10:00 and  12:00 am using the protocol of de Klein and Harvey (2012). On each sampling occasion, lids  were placed on the chambers and remained in place for 40 minutes with headspace samples  taken at 0, 20 and 40 minutes from each chamber. Gas samples were analysed for N2O  concentration using a Perkin Elmer 580 Gas Chromatograph (linked to a TurboMatrix 110  headspace autosampler).    © Photos by A. Carswell (left) and A.R Sánchez-Rodríguez (right): Static N2O chamber at North Wyke (left) and  automated N2O chamber at Henfaes farm (right).    At the HF site, (see above for description of manual static chamber methodology) the  automatic chambers were installed two weeks prior to the start of the experiment, the chamber  bases were inserted into the soil and the chambers (50 cm × 50 cm × 20 cm) attached to the  bases at surface height to ensure an air-tight seal. Closing and opening of the chambers was  controlled by pneumatic actuators. The chambers closed sequentially for a 30 minute period,  during which the chamber-headspace was sampled via a sampling port at a rate of 1 litre per  minute. Samples were delivered to an Isotopic N2O Analyser and N2O concentrations were  recorded at 0.1 Hz for each 30 minute sampling period. The first 30 seconds of data from each  sampling period was removed from calculations to account for the dead volume in the sample  lines. Accuracy of the N2O analysis was checked weekly using certified N2O standards.    Hourly N2O fluxes (µg N2O-N m-2 h-1) were calculated using linear regression, with the  assumption of linearity. Calculations on the automatic chamber data set were made using the 16  lm() function in R (version 3.3.2., R Core Team 2016). The manual chamber data set were  calculated according to de Klein and Harvey (2012; Excel, Office 2016) as:  FN2O = H(Ct – Ct0)/t  where H is the ratio of chamber volume to soil surface area (m3 to m-2), Ct is the concentration  of N2O within the chamber at the time (t) of sampling and Ct0 is the N2O concentration  measured at 0 minutes, measured after the chamber had been sealed. Cumulative N2O  emissions were calculated for each plot for the three N-application periods using the area  under a curve function “cumtrapz()” from the “pracma” package ( Borchers 2016) in R (R Core  Team 2016).    For the digestate experiment (2017), N-loss as N2O was expressed as a percentage of the  total N applied for each treatment after subtracting the cumulative N2O emissions from the  control plots to normalize for the different N application rates.    At the EB site, N2O fluxes were measured during the length of the growing season using static  chambers. The chambers consisted of a cylindrical polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic pipe of 38  cm inner diameter (ID) and 22 cm height fitted with sealed lid and a flange at the base. The  chambers were placed onto a plastic flanged collar that had been inserted on average 5 cm  into the soil to form a seal in the soil. A layer of draught sealant material held in place by four  strong gripping clips formed an airtight seal between the chamber and the collar for the  duration of the flux measurement. Chambers were closed for 60 minutes, during which time  four gas samples were collected via a syringe and a three-way tap fitted to the lid, at times 0,  20, 40 and 60 minutes. Gas samples were stored in 20 mL glass vials which were flushed with  100 mL of air from the syringe using a double needle. Samples were analysed using gas  chromatography (7890B GC system fitted with an electron capture detector, Agilent  Technologies, UK). Measurements were carried out daily for two weeks after fertiliser  additions, then every second day for a further two to four weeks. Measurements were made  only on working days (Monday to Friday) between 09:00 and 15:00 GMT. Fluxes were  calculated as:  ܨ ൌ ݀ܥ/݀ݐ ∗ ߩܸ/ܣ  where F is the gas flux from the soil (nmol m-2 s-1), dC/dt is the rate of change in the  concentration in time in nmol mol-1 s-1 estimated by linear regression, ρ is the density of air in  mol m-3, V is the volume of the chamber in cubic meters and A is the ground area enclosed by  the chamber in square meters.    Cumulative fluxes over the experimental periods (25 days) were calculated using a Bayesian  approach, taking into account the lognormal distribution of spatial samples and the lognormal  peak-and-decay pattern in time (Levy et al. 2017). Based on the assumption that at a given  time, N2O fluxes, F, are typically lognormally-distributed in space, the probability density is  given by:  ݂ሺܨሻൌ1/ሺ√ሺሺ2ߨሻሻ ߪ௟௢௚ ܨሻ݁ݔ݌ሺെሺሺ݈݋݃ሺܨሻെߤ௟௢௚ ሻଶ/ሺ2ߪ௟௢௚ଶሻሻሻ  where μlog and σlog are the location and scale parameters, equivalent to the mean and standard  deviation of the log-transformed variate. The mean of the distribution is given by:  ߤൌ݁ݔ݌ሺߤ௟௢௚ ൅0.5ߪ௟௢௚ଶሻ   Following a fertiliser addition event, the course of N2O flux is expected to rise to a peak, then  decay exponentially. This pattern in time is also well described by the lognormal equation: 17  ߤ௧ൌ1/ሺ√ሺሺ2ߨሻሻ ݇ݐሻ݁ݔ݌ሺെሺሺ݈݋݃ሺݐሻെ߂ሻଶ/ሺ2݇ଶሻሻሻ ∗ܰ௜௡ ߗ  where μt is the spatial mean of the N2O flux at time t, Δ and k are analogues for the location  and scale parameters, and with the additional term Nin is the fertiliser nitrogen input and ߗ is  the fraction of this which is emitted as N2O as t tends toward infinity. Δ can be interpreted as  the natural logarithm of the delay between fertiliser application and peak flux; k is a decay rate  term. Equation 4 is an intrinsic function in all statistical software, and can be encoded as:  ߤ௧ ൌ ݈݀݊݋ݎ݉ሺݐ, ߂, ݇ሻ ∗ ܰ௜௡ߗ  So, at time t following fertiliser addition, the mean flux is given by equation 4 or 5, at which  time the N2O flux has a distribution:  ܨ ∼ ݈݊ܰ൫ߤ௟௢௚,௧, ߪ௟௢௚ଶ൯, where  ߤ௟௢௚,௧ൌ ݈݋݃ሺߤ௧ሻ െ 0.5ߪ௟௢௚ଶ  The parameters μ, μlog and σlog were estimated using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)  method with Gibbs sampling (Gelman, 2013). This was implemented using the freely available  JAGS software (Plummer, 2016). The prior distribution for omega was based on the data  collated by Stehfest (2006). The prior distributions for Delta and k were based on the dynamics  of the DNDC model (Li 1992, as described in Levy et al. 2017).

In 2016, soil cores were taken in control plots before  the fertiliser treatments were initiated (T0), before the first harvest (T1), and before the final  harvest (T2) (Table 4). In 2017, soils were taken shortly after the digestate treatments were  initiated (T1) and before the final harvest (T2) (Table 4). In 2018, five soil samples were taken  from the topsoil 0-15 cm at each site and for each land use (Table 5).  Table 4: Soil sampling dates for the grass trial in 2016 and the digestate trial in 2017.

In 2018, the summer was very dry and  the plant growth was accelerated. This meant that harvest times had to be moved forward to capture plant peak  biomass. If sampling took more than one day, the first day is indicated.    WP2: At both the NW and HF sites in 2016 soil was sampled three times weekly for the first  two weeks following N fertiliser application, then twice weekly for the following two weeks, and  once weekly thereafter. From each plot a minimum of 6 soil samples were taken using an  auger (of 1 or 2.5 cm i.d. at HF and NW respectively) to a depth of 10 cm. The cores were  bulked and transported to the laboratory for storage at 4°C or -18°C in the dark at NW and HF  respectively. Soils were subsequently analysed for NH4+ and NO3- using the colorimetric  methods of Mulvaney (1996; for NH4+) and Miranda et al. (2001; for NO3-).

Fitos (left  & right) and D. Chadwick  (middle): Soil sampling at  Rothamsted Resarch  (2018), Henfaes farm  (2017) and Kirkton (2018). 19  At the NW and HF sites in 2017, for the first three months, soil was sampled from the sampling  area of each plot three times per week for the first two weeks after digestate application, two  times per week for the next two weeks, followed by weekly sampling thereafter. Subsequently,  soil samples were taken once per month until the end of the experiment. On each occasion,  eight soil samples were taken per plot for 0-15 cm depth and pooled to provide one  representative sample per plot. At the NW site, soil was sampled proportionally from within  and between the digestate bands. At the HF site, soil was sampled randomly, as there were  no distinct digestate bands. Soil samples were stored at 4 °C and in the dark prior to analyses.    At the EB site, soil cores were sampled in 2016 and 2017 from a distance of approximately 2  m from the static gas chambers (within the appropriate experimental plot) each time N2O flux  measurements were made. Cores were 3 cm in diameter and 10 cm in depth. Samples were  stored at -18 °C until further processing up to three months later. Potassium Chloride (KCl)  solution (50 mL, 1 mol L-1) was used to extract Nr (in the form of NH4+ and NO3-) from the  samples (15 grams of wet soil). Having added the 1 M KCl solution to the samples, they were  subsequently mixed on an orbital shaker for 60 mins before the solution was filtered using 2.5  µm filter paper (Fisherbrand, US) and stored at -18 °C until analysis, up to three months later.  A further 10 g of mixed soil was dried to provide the dry soil ratio of each soil sample.      5.4.1 Soil N metric: ammonium, nitrate, amino acids, peptides, mineralisable N    Measured by Bangor University.  Units: Ammonium, nitrate, amino acids, peptides mineralisable N - all in mg N per kg dry soil.  A sub-sample of 5 g fresh soil was gently mixed and used to determine mineral N measures:  a 0.5 M K2SO4 solution was used in a 1:5 soil:extractant ratio (w:v) shaking at 150 rev min−1  for 30 minutes and then centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 minutes. The supernatant was stored  at −20 °C prior to analyses.  Ammonium in the supernatant was determined colorimetrically using the salicylate method  of Mulvaney (1996) and nitrate using vanadium chloride according to Miranda et al. (2001) in  a Powerwave XS plate reader (Bio Tek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT).    Amino acids and peptides were extracted using OPA-MET reagent (containing a mix of o- phthaldialdehyde dissolved in methanol, b-mercaptoethanol and borate buffer-pH 9.5) which  was added in a 1:10 sample:reagent ratio (Jones et al., 2002). The samples used for soluble  peptides and proteins were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 minutes, and then 100 µL of each  sample was mixed with 100 µL of concentrated HCl, the O2 replaced with N2 in a O2-free  atmosphere, heated for 16 hours at 105 °C, and, finally, 200 µL 6M NaOH added to each  sample when they returned to ambient temperature (modified from Bremmer, 1950).  Standards of glycine were used to make the calibration curve in both cases. Amino acids and  peptides were measured in the same supernatant stored at −20°C using a Cary Eclipse  Fluorescence Spectrophotometer with a ProStar Solvent Delivery Module (Varian, USA).    Mineralisable N was determined after anaerobic incubation according to Keeney (1982) using  5 g of soil and calculating the differences in NH4+ between the initial concentrations and the  concentrations after 7 days of anaerobic incubation.    Data were compiled in Microsoft Excel files. All measurements were on a fresh soil-basis.  Based on the soil moisture content of each sample, data were converted to nitrogen content  per grams dry soil. 20      5.4.2 Soil dissolved organic C and total dissolved N (DOC and TDN)    Measured by Bangor University.   Units: DOC - mg carbon per kg dry soil, TDN - mg N per kg dry soil.    DOC and TDN were measured in the supernatant of the K2SO4 extract (see section on soil  nitrogen metric above), using a Multi N/C 2100/2100 analyser (AnalytikJena AG, Jena,  Germany). DON was calculated by subtracting NH4+ and NO3− from the TDN value.    Data were compiled in Microsoft Excel files. All measurements are based on a fresh soil basis.  Based on the soil moisture content of each sample, data were converted to nitrogen content  per grams dry soil.    Data were compiled in Microsoft Excel files. All measurements were on a fresh-soil basis.  Based on the soil moisture content of each sample, data were converted to DOC and TDN  per grams dry soil.      5.4.3 Soil microbial biomass C and N (MBC and MBN)    Measured by Bangor University in 2016 and 2017, measured by CEH Bangor in 2018.  Units: MBC - mg carbon per kg dry soil, MBN - mg N per kg dry soil.    MBC and MBN were measured at Bangor University and CEH Bangor using the same  method. MBC and MBN were measured on 5 grams of soil that were kept for 7 days in a  desiccator with chloroform (to kill the microorganisms). The difference between the DOC and  DON after 7 days incubation (as explained above) and the initial values DOC and DON value  (calculated as in the previous paragraph) were used to calculate MBC and MBN using the  correction factors 0.45 for MBC and 0.54 for MBN.    QA/QC: two laboratory standards (BS1 and BS3) and random replicates were run within each  batch. Data were compiled in Microsoft Excel files and data were checked by another member  of staff before released to the project manager.      5.4.4 Aggregate size distribution    Measured by CEH Bangor.  Units: Aggregates size distribution - percent.    Aggregate size distribution was measured using about 1 g of air-dry and sieved soil through  a stack of 2 mm and 1 mm sieves, the fraction collected into the 1 mm sieve was introduced  into a Beckman-Coulter LS 13320 laser diffraction particle size analyser and measured for the  size distribution.    QA/QC: each sample measurement was replicated, and two laboratory standards (BS1 and  BS3) were run with each batch. Data were compiled in Microsoft Excel files and data were  checked by another member of staff before being released to the project manager. 21    Aggregate size distribution measured using a wet sieving apparatus.    5.4.5 Soil texture (sand, silt, clay)    Measured by CEH Bangor.  Units: sand, silt, clay in percent; add up to 100%.    Soil texture was measured at CEH Bangor. Particle size distribution was measured using a  Beckman-Coulter LS 13320 laser diffraction particle size analyser. Soil was manually coned  and quartered 0.5 g from the soil to get a subsample, removed organic matter using H2O2 and  transferred the sample into a 250 mL bottle. Then, 5 mL of 5% Calgon were added and the  solution was shaken overnight. The entire content of the bottle was introduced to the laser  analyser for measuring particles size distribution.    QA/QC: two laboratory standards (BS1 and BS3) were run with each batch, random replicates  were run, and soils of standard sizes were run to check for accuracy and precision. The sand  fraction was collected and compared to the amount of sand calculated. BS1 and BS3 have  been analysed by the traditional gravimetric method and serve as external evaluation for the  performance of the laser technique. Data were compiled in Microsoft Excel files and data were  checked by another member of staff before released to the project manager.      5.4.6 Soil moisture and soil organic matter content (SOM)    Measured by CEH Bangor.  Unit: SOM in percent.    WP1: Soil water content and SOM were measured at CEH Bangor. SOM was measured as  loss-on-ignition (LOI). Soil was initially dried at 25oC for 14 days. Then, a 10 g subsample was  weighed into a crucible and put into an oven at 105ºC for 24 hours, the weight loss provides  the soil water content. The same crucible with the dry soil was then introduced into a Carbolite  furnace at 375 ºC for 16 hours, this second weight loss is quantified and reported as SOM.  Soil water content and SOM were recorded in percent.    QA/QC: two laboratory standards (BS1 and BS3) and random replicates were run in each  batch. Data were compiled in Microsoft Excel files and data were checked by another member  of staff before data to the project manager. 22    5.4.7 Soil pH and electrical conductivity (EC)    Measured at CEH Bangor for WP1 and by Bangor University and Rothamsted Research for  WP2.   Units: pH is unitless, EC - micro Siemens per metre.    WP1: In a beaker, 25 mL deionised water was added to 10 g of field moist soil; the solution  was rested for 30 minutes to allow the solution to reach an equilibration. The solution was  stirred at time=0 and 15 minutes. pH was measured using a Corning 220 pH meter, VWR  combination electrode 662-1805. EC was measured after the pH measurement in the same  beaker using a Jenway 4510 with a 662-1805 electrode. pH in CaCl2 was measured after EC  following the addition of 2 mL of 0.125 molar CaCl2.    QA/QC: Before the measurement of each batch, the pH is calibrated with pH 4 and pH 7, and  the EC electrode in these solutions. The two laboratory standards (BS1 and BS3) are checked  for accuracy of measurements. Data were compiled in Microsoft Excel files and data were  checked by another member of staff before released to the project manager.    WP2: pH and EC were determined in a 1:2.5 (w/v) soil:distilled water suspension with standard  electrodes using a Model 209 pH meter (Hanna Instruments Ltd., Leighton Buzzard, UK) and  a Jenway 4520 conductivity meter (Cole-Palmer Ltd., Stone, UK).    QA/QC: Two laboratory standards and random replicates were run each time. Data were  compiled in Microsoft Excel files and data were checked by another member of staff before  data being released to the project manager.      5.4.8 Soil base cations (Na, K, Ca and Mg)    Measured by CEH Lancaster.  Units: mg per kg dry soil.  Two grams of sieved soil were weighed into acid-washed LDPE extraction bottles and 50 mL  of 1 molar Ammonium Acetate at pH 7 was added. The samples were placed on an end-over- end shaker for 1 hour at 30 revolutions per minute. The samples were filtered using Whatman  no. 44 filters which were pre-rinsed with ultra-pure water. The first 5 mL of the filtrates were  discarded and a subsequent 45 mL aliquote collected in acid washed tubes and stored at 4oC  prior to measurement. The base cations Na, K, Ca and Mg were measured on a 10 mL filtrate  by ICP-OES using matched calibration standards (Perkin Elmer Optima 7300 DV).    QA/QC: Blanks and two reference soils were extracted using the same method and measured  alongside the samples. The reference soils SR2 and SR3 were locally sampled glacial drift  and locally sampled agricultural soil, respectively. Data were compiled in Batch97 (laboratory  LIMS) with the concentration of base cations in the soil extract being converted to mg/kg dry  weight soil, and data were checked by the laboratory technical manager before being released  to the project manager. 23  5.4.9 Total soil C and N    Prepared by CEH Bangor and Lancaster.  Measured by CEH Lancaster for WP1, at Bangor University and Rothamsted Research for  WP2.  Units: C and N - percent.  WP1 carbon and nitrogen: Ball milled soil samples were oven dried at 105°C (± 5°C) for a  minimum of 3 hours, cooled and sealed prior to weighing. 20 mg of soil were weighed into a  tin cup on a 6-place micro-balance. An Elementar Vario EL was used to measure total soil C  and N and works on the principle of oxidative combustion followed by thermal conductivity  detection.    QA/QC: All calculations were done by the instrument software and results expressed in %  notation. The instrument’s calibration is checked on use using a working standard (Acetanilide)  with concentrations of 71.1% total C and 10.4 % total N and the data corrected (factored)  against these values. Two of these standards are analysed at the beginning of every run, with  every 10 samples and again at the end of a run. At least two reference soils were analysed  with each batch at intervals of every 20 samples.    WP2: Total soil C and N were determined on 0.05 and 0.10 grams of ground soil using a  TruSpec® analyser (Leco Corp., St Joseph, MI) and ground oven-dried soil (105 °C, 24 h).    QA/QC: Soil samples with known C and N concentration were analysed every 10 to 12  samples. Data were compiled in Microsoft Excel files.      5.4.10 Total phosphorus    Measured by CEH Lancaster.  Unit: total P - mg P per kg dry soil.    Total phosphorus was digested with a H2O2/H2SO4 based digestion reagent mix (along with  selenium and lithium sulphate) in soil samples and subsequent colorimetric analysis carried  out on a Seal discrete analyser. Soils were air dried and ground to 2 mm, 0.36 g of soil was  weighed into boiling tubes and 4.4 mL of digestion mix was added. Sufficient blanks are run  without sample to allow for standards and controls to be prepared later in the same matrix as  the samples.    The boiling tubes were then placed in a block digester and the temperature stepped to 250oC  and held for 15 minutes to allow the mixture to stabilise and then further stepped to 400oC  where the temperature is maintained for 2 hours to complete the digestion.    Once digested the samples, reference samples and blanks are allowed to cool, then diluted  to a total volume of 50 mL using ultrapure water.  After allowing the precipitate to settle  overnight, the supernatant is collected and diluted a further 5 times and then measured  colourimetrically using a SEAL AQ2 discrete analyser. The samples were mixed in heated  discrete reaction segments with acidic ammonium molybdate and potassium antimony tartrate  to form a complex with phosphate. This complex is reduced with ascorbic acid to develop a  molybdenum blue colour which is measured for absorbance at 880 nm. 24  QA/QC: References soil samples are handled and measured the same way as the samples.  Blanks are run to allow for standards and controls to be non-contaminated. Calibrations are  run using standards prepared from blank matrix digested in the same manner as the samples  with control standards (also prepared in matrix) analysed every ten samples to check precision  throughout the run.  Blanks are run every 20 samples with certified reference samples  (prepared in matrix). Data is extracted into LIMS where the data is processed, blank corrected,  moisture corrected and reported as P in mg/kg.      5.4.11 Permanganate oxidisable C (POXC)    Measured by CEH Bangor.  Units: POXC - mg carbon per kg dry soil.    POXC was measured on manually quarter 2.5 grams of air dried soil following the method  described in Weil et al. 2003. Deionized water (18 mL) were added to each soil sample with 2  mL of 0.2 molar KMnO4. Samples were vigorously shaken for 2 seconds, then shaken at 240  oscillations per minute for 2 minutes. Soils were allowed to settle in the tubes in a dark and  cool place for exactly 10 minutes. Then 0.5 mL of the supernatant and 49.5 mL of deionised  water were transferred into another tube. This step has to be done quickly as the  permanganate will continue to react with the soil. Sample solutions were transferred to 96-well  plates and measured at 550 nm. Blank samples (only deionised water) and standards were  shaken and rested in the same way as the soil samples and transferred to the same 96-well  plate. The more POXC in the sample, the lower the absorbance.    QA/QC: two reference soils (BS1 and BS3) and blanks were included in each batch which  were processed in the same way as the samples. A standard calibration curve allows for  calculating the amount of POXC in the sample solution. Data were compiled in Microsoft Excel  files and data were checked by another member of staff before released to the project  manager.                              © Photos by S. Reinsch: Colorimetric measurement of permanganate oxidisable C from soils.    5.4.12 Citric acid extractable P, acetic acid extractable P, Olsen-P    Measured: citric acid extractable phosphorus (CEH Bangor) and Olsen-P (CEH  Lancaster) were for WP1. Acetic acid extractable phosphorus was measured by Bangor  University for WP2. 25  Units: all measures - mg phosphorus per kg dry soil.    Olsen-P was measured using two grams of sieved, air dried soil were extracted in 40 mL  Olsen’s reagent (0.5 M NaHCO3 at pH 8.5) for 30 minutes in a mechanical end over end  shaker.  The sample was then filtered through a Whatman 44 filter paper to separate the soil  and the filtrate; the filtrate was kept for Olsen-P analysis.    The analysis is performed on a Seal Analytical AA3 segmented flow analyser.  The samples  are mixed in the flow channel with acidic ammonium molybdate and potassium antimony  tartrate to form a complex with phosphate. This complex is reduced with ascorbic acid to  develop a molybdenum blue colour. The reaction is temperature controlled to ensure uniform  colour development. The developed colour is measured at 880 nm.    QA/QC: The data is processed by the instrument software, exported and placed in an Excel  file. The mean of two extraction blanks is used to correct the data set. The data is then  extracted to LIMS which calculates the final concentration in mg-P per kg soil, corrected for  moisture content. Two quality control reference samples and a duplicate sample were run  every 25 samples to ensure data quality.  The calibration range of this method is 0-5 mg-P per  Litre.    Citric acid extractable P was measured using 10 mM citrate acid which extracted the active  inorganic P pool sorbed to clay particles or weakly bound in inorganic precipitates (DeLuca et  al. 2015). This method emulates organic acid release by plants and microorganisms. Briefly,  0.5 g of fresh soil was added to 15 mL tubes and 10 mL of 10 mM citric acid were added.  Samples then shaken for 3 hours at ~ 200 rev per minute. Samples then centrifuged at 3200  g for 30 minutes. An aliquot of the supernatant was removed and stored for max of 3 days at  4°C prior to analysis.    Samples were then analysed for P by colorimetry using Malachite Green Method (Ohno and  Zibilske (1991). Colored samples were transferred to a 96-well plate: 50 µL of reagent were  added in a well, followed by 200 µL of sample/standard, then the plate was left to develop a  green colour for one hour. The absorbance was read at 630 nm using a Biotek PowerWave  XS microplate spectrophotometer. A standard curve regression was used to convert  absorbance readings into concentrations of P.    QA/QC: Blanks and two reference standards (BS1 and BS3) were run on each 96-well plate  as well as a standard curve. Individual samples were re-run when the measured values were  outside the range of the standard curve. Data were compiled in Microsoft Excel files and data  were checked by another member of staff before released to the project manager.    WP2: Acetic acid extractable P was used as a proxy for plant-available P, determined after  extracting the field moist soil with 0.5 M acetic acid (1:5 w/v, 200 rev min−1 for 1 h) by the  molybdate blue method (Murphy and Riley, 1962) following centrifugation (10,000 g, 10 min).    QA/QC: Standards for the calibration curve were prepared using a 1000 mg P L−1 commercial  solution and random replicates were run each time. Data were compiled in Microsoft Excel  files and data were checked by another member of staff before data were released to the  project manager. 26  5.4.13 DNA, N genes    Measured: DNA extractions were performed by Rothamsted Research Harpenden. Extracts  were analysed for nitrogen genes at Rothamsted Research in Harpenden. Extracts were  also sent to CEH Wallingford for analyses of OTUs.  Units: qPCR data in gene copy number per gram dry soil    DNA extractions: Soil community DNA was extracted from 0.25 gams soil using the MoBio  DNA PowerSoil DNA isolation kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, Inc. Carlsbad, CA), following  manufacturers protocol. Extracted DNA was quantified by fluorometer Qubit® 2.0 dsDNA BR  Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and quality checked by nanodrop (Thermo Fisher  Scientific).    qPCR (followed protocol as detailed in De Sosa et al. 2018)  Microbial nitrogen cycling gene abundance was investigated by quantitative-PCR (qPCR)  targeting speciﬁc genes or genetic regions. Bacterial and archaeal communities were targeted  via the 16S rRNA genes, while the fungal community abundance was targeted by the ITS  region. The diﬀerent communities involved in soil nitrogen cycling were investigated:  -  nitrogen ﬁxation (nifH gene);   -  nitriﬁcation by targeting the ammonia oxidising bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA)  (amoA gene), and   -  denitriﬁers via the nitrite reductase (nirK and nirS genes) and the nitrous oxide  reductase (nosZ genes clade I and II)  -  The ability to degrade urea was also assessed by targeting the ureC gene.  Quantitative-PCR ampliﬁcations were performed in 10 μL volumes containing 5 μL of  QuantiFast (Qiagen, Manchester, UK), 2.8 μL of nuclease-free water (Severn Biotech,  Kidderminster, UK), 0.1 μL of each primer (1 μM) and 2 μL of template DNA at 5 ng μL−1, using  a CFX384 Touch® Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, UK).    QA/QC: Standards for each molecular target were obtained using a 10 fold serial dilution of  PCR products ampliﬁed from an environmental reference DNA (also used as positive control)  and puriﬁed by gel extraction using the Wizard® SV Gel and PCR Clean Up System (Promega,  Southampton, UK) following the manufacturer's instruction and quantiﬁed by ﬂuorometer  Qubit® 2.0 dsDNA BR Assay Kit (Thermo FisherScientiﬁc).    Standard curve template DNA and the negative/positive controls were ampliﬁed in triplicate.  Ampliﬁcation conditions for all qPCR assays consisted in 2 steps: ﬁrst denaturation at 95°C  for 5 minutes followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 10 seconds and 60°C for 30 seconds that  included annealing, elongation and reading. Each ampliﬁcation was followed by melting curve  (increase in temperature from 60°C to 95°C, with a reading every 0.5°C) to assess the  speciﬁcity of each assay.    The eﬃciency of the qPCR varied between 85.2% and 95.9% (except nozII 74.4%, amplicon  746 bp long), and R2 between 0.987 and 0.999. The melting curves showed speciﬁcity for all  the genes, except as expected for the fungal ITS, that showed the ampliﬁcation of products of  diﬀerent lengths,due to the variability in length of the ITS region between diﬀerent fungal taxa  (Manter and Vivanco, 2007). 27  5.4.14 Microbial diversity indices  Measured by CEH Wallingford.   Units: Shannon’s Index, Richness, Bacterial Phylum level frequency (percentage of total)    Molecular analyses of soil DNA: Extracted DNA was supplied from Rothamsted Research  in Harpenden (see 5.4.13) for amplicon sequencing at the facilities of the Molecular Ecology  Group, Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Wallingford. <50 μL volumes of DNA extract were  supplied in 96-well plate format, these were subject to:  -  16S rRNA amplicon sequencing as per Kozich 2013 (Development of a dual-index  sequencing strategy and curation pipeline for analyzing amplicon sequence data on  the MiSeq Illumina sequencing platform), utilising V3-V4 region primers  -  ITS rRNA amplicon sequencing employing the Kozich 2013 strategy and utilizing ITS  primers by Ihrmark 2012 (New primers to amplify the fungal ITS2 region--evaluation  by 454-sequencing of artificial and natural communities)    Amplicons were sequenced on Illumina MiSeq platform with V3 chemistry. Resulting  sequences were demultiplexed using Illumina Basespace. Bacterial 16S amplicons were  processed using in-house developed pipelines for quality filtering, merging and taxonomic  assignment (GreenGenes database) of operational taxonomic units. Fungal ITS amplicons  were processed using the R package Dada2 for quality filtering, merging and taxonomic  assignment (UNITE database) of Actual Sequence Variants. R package Vegan was used to  analyse amplicon sequences. Bacterial and fungal Shannon’s Index diversity scores for each  sample were produced from rarefied data using ‘diversity’ function. Species richness for each  sample were similarly produced using ‘specnumber’ function.    QA/QC: Amplicon specific PCRs were undertaken for each sample along with negative  controls. All samples including negative controls were normalised using Invetrogen  SequalPrep normalisation kit before sequencing. Samples which produced read numbers  below 2000 were discarded before rarefication and further analysis.      5.4.15 Soil water infiltration  Measured by CEH Bangor.   Units: mL.    Soil water infiltration was measured in the field in spring and summer 2018 using a Mini Disk  Infiltrometer (METER group, Inc. USA), a compact infiltration measuring device with a disk  radius of 2.25 cm. At each site, where possible, nine measurements were conducted, at three  different tensions (0.5 cm, 1 cm and 3 cm). Measurements were taken along a transect  avoiding field or boundary edges, transitions between different types of vegetation or land use  and from the same slope gradient; or in the case of small experimental plots (i.e Silwood,  Harpenden) using an appropriately spaced 'W' pattern sampling design. Vegetation was  carefully trimmed away to reveal the soil surface and a thin layer of sand applied to ensure  good contact between the disk and the soil surface. The raw data was then entered into the  Decagon mini-disk infiltrometer Excel macro to calculate hydraulic conductivity, with further  processing and graphical work conducted in R. 28    5.4.16 Soil water release curves  Measured by CEH Bangor.   Units: Volumetric soil water content in m3 per m3; hydraulic conductivity in cm per day.  Soil water release curves were measured on 250 cm3 soil cores, 0–5 cm deep, taken from  different land uses across the UK in 2018. Water release curves were determined using the  laboratory evaporation method using a hyprop22 (UMS, Munchen, Germany). The very dry  end of the water retention curve was measured on samples using a WP4 (Decagon devices,  Pullman, Washington, USA) (Tuller and Or 2005). Hydraulic conductivity was determined at  low suctions (1–6 cm) with the hyprop and at high suctions (30–800 cm) in the field using a  mini-disk infiltrometer (ETER group, Inc. USA). Moisture release curve data was modelled  using HYPRO-FIT software (UMS, Munchen, Germany) to determine hydraulic parameters  using the Mualem-Durner bimodal soil water retention curve (Durner 1994) and the Peters and  Durner hydraulic conductivity model (Peters and Durner 2008).      © Photos by S.

KWS Siskin) was drilled on 10th October  2016 with a row spacing of 0.1 m at the NW and HF sites. Prior to this, the fields were  ploughed to 15 cm depth and limed to increase the soil pH. Phosphorus (P) and potassium  (K) were applied during the same week of sowing. Kieserite (MgSO4∙H2O) was applied in  March 2017 at both sites. Application rates were based on routine soil analyses and national  fertiliser guidelines (Defra, 2010) so that these elements were non-limiting. Herbicides at both  sites, and insecticides and fungicides only at the NW site were also applied according to  manufacturers’ recommendations.

Lower Beas and Sutlej Rivers: Riparian vegetation dynamics Summary The data was produced as part of a study to determine how changes in geomorphic form and dynamics due to human alteration to river flows and riparian land management relate to changes in vegetation communities in the Sutlej and Beas Rivers, India. Vegetated and other land cover, including water area, were quantified by winter season NDVI trends (in the plains of Punjab) and seasonal supervised classification of Landsat data for over a 30-year period.  It comprises: River Section, Zone and Test Site delineation (shapefiles) (plains only) Winter Season average NDVI by section and zone (spreadsheet) 1989-2020 (plains only) Landcover maps (raster files) seasonally 1989-2020 (plains and upper Beas) Landcover fractions by section and zone (seasonally) 1989-2020 (plains only) Scope and Spatial Extent Beas River from Pong Dam downstream to confluence with Sutlej River Sutlej River from Bhakra Dam downstream to confluence with Beas River Upper Beas from Palchan downstream to just upstream of Pong Dam (landcover only) Coordinate System: WGS1984 West: 74.957, East: 77.357, North: 32.393, South: 30.780 Collection/generation methods  Section, Zone and Test Site delineation Sections: The longitudinal sections were defined by earlier work (Vercruysse and Grabowski, 2021b). In the lower reaches (plains area, see Figure 1), the section immediately below the dams (S0) of each river has a different planform (braided) to the other sections, S1 – S4/5, which are all in the flatter, wider plains of Punjab state, where the rivers are predominantly single thread. These lower sections are delineated in approximately 30 km lengths. Here the valley bottom is very wide in places and the edges are difficult to delineate. For the Upper Beas, above the Pong Dam, (Figure 2) the river is divided into 11 Sections, S1-11. S5 is a short zone which coincides with a stretch of river that is part of the dam lake of the Pandoh Dam. S3A is another short section that is part of the dam lake of the Pandoh Dam, which was completed in 2006, within the timeframe of this analysis.  Geomorphic Zones: The Active Channel zone was delineated by the maximum wetted area between 1989-2018 as calculated by (Vercruysse and Grabowski, 2021b). The delineation of the Valley Bottom and Valley Slopes zones was assisted by geomorphon classification (Jasiewicz and Stepinski, 2013) using the 30m ALOS digital surface map (DSM) reduced to 90m resolution. In some areas geomorphic transitions remained uncertain, so the zone boundaries were set to ensure that any previous river channels evident in satellite imagery would be included in the Valley Bottom Zone, otherwise at a nominal 1 km distance from the inner one.  Figure 1 - Section and Zone delineation for lower reaches of Beas and Sutlej Rivers, “Plains”.  Figure 2 - Section and Zone delineation for the upper reaches of the Beas River, “Upper Beas” Test Sites: Several sites in the plains were selected to help understand how and where vegetation cover has changed within and around the river. These sites, defined by a shapefile, were selected as being within sections of river where geomorphic changes had previously been identified (Vercruysse and Grabowski, 2021a).  Goindwal-Sahib site is in section S4 of the Beas River, where there was evidence of channel simplification (reduction in anabranching index) and channel straightening (reduction in channel area without significant change in width). Zindanpur site is part of S1 of the Sutlej River identified as an area of significant channel narrowing. The Mau site in S3 of the Sutlej River is a site where there was evidence of gravel and sand bars becoming vegetated.  Nature and Units of recorded values Winter season average NDVI by section and zone 1989-2020 (plains only) Winter season Landsat 5, 7 and 8 top of atmosphere (TOA) images between 1989 and 2020 were processed in Google Earth Engine (GEE) (Gorelick et al., 2017) using images from the winter season (January to March). Cloudy pixels were masked by the algorithm provided in GEE for analysis of Landsat data. NDVI and mNDWI were calculated at each pixel, then averaged across all images to produce an image of winter season mean values. Those pixels with mean mNDWI > 0.15 (water surface) were excluded from the NDVI analysis. For each combination of section and zone, a spatially averaged, mean winter season NDVI was calculated for each year using GEE zonal statistics functions. Landcover maps (rasters) seasonally 1989-2020 (plains and upper Beas) Landcover classification maps were created in GEE, using the same Landsat images as the NDVI analysis, by Gradient Tree Boost (Friedman, 2002) classifier with 10 decision trees. The raw data comprised the blue, green, red, NIR, SWIR1 and SWIR2 channels (bands 1-5 and 7 of Landsat 5/ 7 and bands 2-7 of Landsat 8). The classification was repeated for all seasons; winter (January to March), pre-monsoon (April to June), monsoon (July to September) and post-monsoon (October to December). The bands were averaged within each season using all the available cloud-free images.  The training datasets were created by manual inspection of the visible band colour images for each year of the 32-year record, identifying locations that were invariant in landcover. The classes and training locations are summarised in the table, below.  Separate training sets (locations provided in .csv files) were used for map creation below the dams (Sutlej and Beas) and above the Pong Dam (Beas only) to mitigate effects due to differing spectral characteristics of soil and vegetation due to topography. Landcover fractions by section and zone (seasonally) 1989-2020 (plains and upper Beas) Taking each image in turn, as the output of the supervised classification process, the number of pixels within each section and zone were counted by landcover class. These counts were divided by the total pixel count in each area to obtain a fractional landcover for each class, by section and zone. This process was also repeated for the three test sites without differentiation into zone or section. Quality control Landsat satellite data was used to collect provide information on spectral surface reflectance, respectively.  These data are accompanied by quality assessment bands which were used to select det afro processing, particularly with respect to obtaining cloud-free images.  Processing was conducted by the project team, with using statistical analysis (such as consumer’s accuracy) and spot validation against aerial satellite photography. Data were checked for errors at all stages by members of the project team at Cranfield University. Details of data structure Format The elements of this dataset are presented in one of the following formats: ESRI Shapefiles plus associated mandatory and optional files Spreadsheets in comma separated value (csv) format GeoTIFF files for landcover images There are two sets: (i) Plains (below Bhakra and Pong Dams) and (ii) Upper Beas, for the Beas River above the Pong Dam. Though they overlap significantly, the training points for classification are geographically separated, so the correct set must be used. The images are tiled, with the following naming convention: SEASON_LC_(PLAINS/UPPERBEAS)-(X_START)-(Y_START).tif The bands are numbered sequentially, please see the corresponding csv file for details of each band File Listing   River Section, Zone and Test Site delineation (shapefiles) Sections.shp (plains) TestSites.shp (plains) Zones.shp (plains) Sections Upper Beas.shp (Upper Beas only) UpBeas_Zones.shp (Upper Beas only) Winter season average NDVI by section and zone (spreadsheet) 1989-2020 (plains only) SUTLEJ_BEAS_NDVI_1989_2020.csv TEST_SITES_NDVI_1989_2020.csv Landcover maps (rasters) seasonally 1989-2020 (plains and Upper Beas) PLAINS_TrainingSet.csv [Training data points for plains landcover] WINTER_LC_PLAINS-0000000000-0000000000.tif WINTER_LC_PLAINS-0000000000-0000006144.tif WINTER_LC_PLAINS-0000006144-0000000000.tif WINTER_LC_PLAINS-0000006144-0000006144.tif WINTER_LC_PLAINS.csv [Key to band names] PREMONSOON_LC_PLAINS-0000000000-0000000000.tif PREMONSOON_LC_PLAINS-0000000000-0000005888.tif PREMONSOON_LC_PLAINS-0000005888-0000000000.tif PREMONSOON_LC_PLAINS-0000005888-0000005888.tif PREMONSOON_LC_PLAINS.csv [Key to band names] MONSOON_LC_PLAINS-0000000000-0000000000.tif MONSOON_LC_PLAINS-0000000000-0000006400.tif MONSOON_LC_PLAINS-0000006400-0000000000.tif MONSOON_LC_PLAINS-0000006400-0000006400.tif MONSOON_LC_PLAINS.csv [Key to band names] POSTMONSOON_LC_PLAINS-0000000000-0000000000.tif POSTMONSOON_LC_PLAINS-0000000000-0000005888.tif POSTMONSOON_LC_PLAINS-0000005888-0000000000.tif POSTMONSOON_LC_PLAINS-0000005888-0000005888.tif POSTMONSOON_LC_PLAINS.csv [Key to band names] UpperBeasTrainingSet.csv [Training data points for Upper Beas landcover] WINTER_LC_UPPERBEAS-0000000000-0000000000.tif WINTER_LC_UPPERBEAS-0000000000-0000005888.tif WINTER_LC_UPPERBEAS-0000005888-0000000000.tif WINTER_LC_UPPERBEAS-0000005888-0000005888.tif WINTER_LC_UPPERBEAS.csv [Key to band names] PRE_MONSOON_LC_UPPERBEAS-0000000000-0000000000.tif PRE_MONSOON_LC_UPPERBEAS-0000000000-0000006144.tif PRE_MONSOON_LC_UPPERBEAS-0000006144-0000000000.tif PRE_MONSOON_LC_UPPERBEAS-0000006144-0000006144.tif PRE_MONSOON_LC_UPPERBEAS.csv MONSOON_LC_UPPERBEAS-0000000000-0000000000.tif MONSOON_LC_UPPERBEAS-0000000000-0000006144.tif MONSOON_LC_UPPERBEAS-0000006144-0000000000.tif MONSOON_LC_UPPERBEAS-0000006144-0000006144.tif MONSOON_LC_UPPERBEAS.csv POST_MONSOON_LC_UPPERBEAS-0000000000-0000000000.tif POST_MONSOON_LC_UPPERBEAS-0000000000-0000005888.tif POST_MONSOON_LC_UPPERBEAS-0000005888-0000000000.tif POST_MONSOON_LC_UPPERBEAS-0000005888-0000005888.tif POST_MONSOON_LC_UPPERBEAS.csv [Key to band names] Landcover fractions by section and zone (seasonally) 1989-2020 Landcover Section and Zone.csv (Plains only, Sutlej and Beas) Landcover Test Sites.csv (Plains – Beas and Sutlej) Upper Beas Landcover Section and Zone.csv (Upper Beas only) Contact Information Dr Robert Grabowski Tel: +44 (0) 1234 758360 Email: r.c.grabowski@cranfield.ac.uk  References Friedman, J.H.

There were 360 squares surveyed for freshwater in CS1990 and 425 surveyed in  CS2000.  In 1996 the Lowland Pond Survey was undertaken at 150 CS squares in environmental  zones 1, 2 and 4.  Following the success of LPS96, the assessment of pond biological condition will  now be fully integrated into CS2007 at all CS squares, not just lowland areas.  For CS2007, the biological condition of headwater streams and ponds will be surveyed.  Countryside  Survey is the only national freshwater survey that has the potential to deal with a range of water body  types across the entire GB landscape.    For headwater streams, the following elements will be re-surveyed in each of the 425 squares visited  for CS2000:  •  Macroinvertebrate community  •  Aquatic plant community  •  Hydromorphological characteristics of the watercourse (River Habitat Survey)  •  Physical characteristics of the watercourse  •  Water chemistry    The following elements will be surveyed in a randomly selected pond in each of the 629 CS2007  squares found to contain ponds:  •  Aquatic plant community  •  Physical characteristics of the waterbody  Water chemistry 2    EQUIPMENT      Equipment will be provided as follows:     General Items  Central  supply  Number  per team  Surveyor  Safety & identification        Bivvy bags  b  2    Dayglo waistcoats  b  3    First aid kit  b  2    Handouts (explaining project)  b      Identity card  b  3    Mobile phones  b  3    Phone cards  b      Torches (in vehicles)  b  1    Whistle  b  3    Personal waterproof clothing   (b)  3  b  Navigation & location        Aerial photographs of the site  b  1    Compass  b  2    Hand held GPS  b  1    Maps of the site (1:10,000)  b  2    Road atlas  b  1    Maps to locate sites (1:50,000)    1    Recording & measuring        Survey poles (x plot)  b  1    Field assessment booklets (FAB's)  b  1    Weatherproof clipboards  b  3    Measuring tape (30 metre)  b  2    Digital camera  b  1    Rangefinder    1    Plot marker boards  b  1    Reloscope    1    DBH tape    1    Poly bags  b      Folding 2m ruler    1    Metal detectors  b  1    Spring balance    1    Rucksack (if available)   b  3  b  Pencils and rubber   b      Reference books (if needed)    b  b  Hand lens    b  b  Binoculars (if available)      b 3    Freshwater equipment  Number  needed per  team  Health and Safety     Life jacket  2  Spare CO2 cylinders  3  Bactericidal soap  2  Tap water container  1  Protek anti-septic cream  2  Antiseptic wipes  2  Hand gloves  2  Shoulder length gloves  2  Penknife  1        General     Thigh waders  2  Chest waders  2  Permanent broad marker pens  2  Scissors  1  Waterproof labels  1  Waterproof notepad  1  A4 aquascribe laser paper (box of 250 sheets)  1  Box file  1  Pencils (soft e.g. 3b)  4  Pencil sharpener  2  Rubber  2  Stapler  1        Stream Macroinvertebrate Sampling     Standard FBA pond-nets with graduated handles  2  18" x 12" plastic bags (pack of 100)  1  1.3 litre polythene pots with tight fitting lids  56  Toxis warning tape for small formalin transort bottles  and sample pots  1  PVC tape for sealing pot lids  2  40% formaldehyde  1  Small plastic bottles for transporting formalin  4  Stop watch  1        River Habitat Survey     Range poles  1 4        Stream Aquatic Plant Survey     9" x 7" re-sealable plastic bags for plants (pack of 100)  1  Small brown envelopes  1        Stream & Pond Chemical Survey     1l bottle for water sample  2  Hanna Combi hand-held pH & conductivity meter   1  pH calibration standards  1  Conductivity calibration standards  1  Distilled water washbottle  1  75 ml syringe  5  Disposable, non-sterile 0.45 µm filter cartridges (33  mm diameter)  1  50ml acid-washed water sample bottles  72  Pre-paid, pre-addressed padded envelopes  40        Pond Aquatic Plant and Environmental Survey     Grapnel  1  Pile of A4 white paper  1  Old newspaper (for drying and pressing plant  specimens)  1  Shallow plastic tray e.g 35cm x 25 cm x 5 cm to float  plants for pressing  1  Thin white card for lifting floating plants for pressing  2  Weight for pressing – e.g plant crib  1  A4 plastic punched wallets for keeping dry pressed  specimens  20  Box file for keeping dry pressed specimens  1  25ml sterilin tubes  30  80% alcohol (25l drum)  0.1 5    HEADWATERS      All 425 squares that were surveyed as part of the freshwater module of CS2000 will be re-surveyed as  part of the headwater stream survey in CS2007.  At each of these 425 squares:  1. The stream macroinvertebrate community will be sampled (RIVPACS method).   2. Associated RIVPACS environmental variables will be recorded.  Stream width & depth, velocity or discharge category, substrate composition,  altitude, distance from source and slope.  3. The hydromorphological status of the site will be recorded (2003 River Habitat Survey  method).  4. The aquatic plant community will be surveyed (MTR method).  5. An indicative water chemistry sample will be taken and analysed for:  pH, conductivity, alkalinity, SRP, TON.  For 25 of the 425 squares we will be sampling a new site on a smaller watercourse to replace the  CS2000 site which has been found to be on >3rd order stream.  This will ensure that for CS2007 and  future surveys the sampling effort is more effectively focussed on headwater streams.  The location of the headwater sampling site within a square was generally chosen to maximise the  length of RHS that could be conducted within the square, while also being as close as possible to the  exit-point from the square.  This approach also tended to maximise the proportion of the site’s  catchment which lay within the bounds of the square.  The length of the headwaters sampling site is 500 m of watercourse.  This 500 m defines the limits of  the RHS survey area.  The 100 m aquatic plant survey stretch is located within this stretch, centred on  the macroinvertebrate and water chemistry sampling point, which in turn are, where possible, located  at RHS spot-check 6 (Figure 1).  However it is not always possible to ensure that the sampling  locations adhere to the ideal arrangement.  A number of reasons for this are envisaged and rules for  dealing with each circumstance have been devised (Fig 2).  If there is any uncertainty about what  to do, then please contact CEH staff.

Assume  that the culverted section flows in a  straightline between disappearing and  re-appearing and record that the stecth is  part-culverted. 7  Distribution of duties  The two assigned freshwater surveyors in a team will be designated as person A and person B for the  purposes of this section.  The following allocation of duties is a recommendation but may be  varied according to local circumstances.  Having established permission to sample, the surveyors should first find the macroinvertebrate  sampling point, using the maps and grid references provided.  All other survey procedures relate to  this position.  Health and safety  Almost all CS2007 headwater survey sites have been previously sampled and therefore are not likely  to be unsafe to sample.  However upon locating the the macoinvertebrate sample point along the  watercourse both surveyors should discuss whether the watercourse is safe to sample.  Issues to  consider include:  •  Vehicle parking, access from road  •  Current weather/flow conditions/water colour (Does the watercourse appear to be in spate?)  •  River bed substrate, ease of access/bank stability and general condition.  •  Obstacles to the watercourse e.g. fencing  •  Livestock in adjacent fields  These factors need to be considered and if any are deemed to be HIGH RISK or more than two are  deemed MODERATE RISK, then do not proceed with the sampling.  It is also advisable to note the  nearest location where there is an adequate mobile phone signal.  Sequence of completion of tasks  If A is the senior freshwater surveyor in each team and B the assistant freshwater surveyor (with  aquatic plant identification skills) then, the allocation of tasks might be as follows:  •  Surveyor A to collect the water sample and record pH and conductivity.  •  Surveyor B to meanwhile begin recording RIVPACS site environmental data.  •  Surveyor A to collect macroinvertebrate sample with assistance on timing, fixing and bagging  of sample from Surveyor B.  •  Surveyor A and B to complete the recording of RIVPACS site environmental data together.  •  Surveyor B to undertake the aquatic plant survey, calling out the information to Surveyor A,  who will enter the data into IRIS while following along on the bankside.  The aquatic plant  survey should extend for 50 m upstream and 50 m downstream of the centre of the  macroinvertebrate sampling area.  •  Surveyor A to undertake the RHS, calling out the information to Surveyor B, who will enter  the data into RAPID while following along on the bankside.  The RHS should, if possible, be  located along the identical stretch of watercourse as was covered in CS2000 (but see RHS  section of handbook for more detail).  The limits of the CS2000 RHS site are indicated on the  map and on the tablet PC. 8  Photographs  Photographs are required of both the macroinvertebrate sampling area and any other features of  interest along the RHS reach.  The macroinvertebrate photograph will be used to relocate the site for  future Countryside Surveys and should be sufficiently wide angled and composed to show any  prominent natural or man-made features that will identify the location accurately for future surveyors.  The marker board should be in the photograph and should be marked with the letter M (for  macroinvertebrate sample) and the square number and should be of the form:  M  457    The RHS photographs should show the typical character of the river along the 500 m survey section.   The marker board should again be included marked with the letters RHS and the square number and  hence be of the form:  RHS  457    The aquatic plant survey photographs should show the typical character of the river along the 100 m  survey section.  The marker board should again be included marked with the letters MTR and the  square number and hence be of the form:  MTR  457    Record the photographs taken on the RIVPACS sample area form and in RAPID and IRIS. 9  Water chemistry sampling and recording  A single indicative chemical sample will be taken at each watercourse.  The sample will be collected  at the downstream end of the macroinvertebrate sampling area prior to any biological sampling.  The following elements will be measured at each headwater site.  •  Conductivity and pH: field measurement  •  Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), total oxidisable nitrogen (TON), alkalinty:  50 ml filtered  Enter the watercourse and facing upstream rinse both 1 L wide-neck bottles 3 times with river water  taken from a flowing area upstream of your position.  Then move a few more steps upstream and fill  the bottles with undisturbed stream water from the water column without disturbing the stream bed or  any soft bed-sediments.  One of the 1 L bottles will be used for the pH and conductivity  measurements, while the other will be used as a source for the filtered water sample to be analysed for  SRP, TON, and alkalinity.  Conductivity and pH measurement  Please familiarize yourselves with the Hanna Combi pH & conductivity meter prior to use.  Read the  manufacturer’s instructions and understand the operational protocols.  Ensure that the meter is well- rinsed since use at the previous site and is properly calibrated (two-point calibration for the pH meter).   The manufacturer’s instructions for calibrating the meter are provided in the meter box.  Ideally the  meter should be checked against the standards before every square and re-calibrated if necessary.  You toggle between pH/conductivity and total dissolved solids display on the meter by pressing the  SET/HOLD button.  Conductivity: Submerge the probe-end of the meter in the collected 1 L sample bottle, immediately  after the sample has been taken.  Select ‘µS’ mode with the SET/HOLD button.  The measurements  should be taken when the stability symbol (a stopwatch icon) on the top left of the display screen  disappears.  Please note the units.  pH: Submerge the meter in the collected 1 L sample bottle, immediately after the sample has been  taken, stirring gently.  Select ‘pH’ mode with the SET/HOLD button.  The measurement should be  taken when the stability symbol (a stopwatch icon) on the top left of the display screen disappears.  Record the readings on the RIVPACS Sample Area Form.  SRP, TON, and alkalinity  A filtered water sample is needed for the analysis of these parameters.  Filtering will be done on site  using disposable 0.45 µm pore size, 33 mm diameter syringe filters.  A 50 ml plastic sample bottle will need to be labeled externally before becoming wet using a black  marker pen:  Project     ‘CS2007’  Type of waterbody:  ‘Stream” or “Pond’  Square number:   square number (e.g. 38)  Date:      day-month-year (e.g. 07-08-07).  Wash the syringe by twice filling the syringe chamber with some of the water sample and emptying it  on to the ground.  Then fill the syringe chamber again with sample water and attach a new disposable  filter cartridge.  Then empty the water in the chamber, through the filter, into the 50 ml plastic sample  bottle.  Rinse the sample bottles out with this water.  Do not exert excessive pressure as this might  rupture the filter. 10  Remove the filter, fill the syringe chamber once more with some of the water sample, re-attach the  same filter cartridge and fill the 50 ml plastic sample bottle.  If filter cartridge becomes blocked  during filtration then change and continue with more of unfiltered water sample.  After filtering,  check the filtered sample for suspended material e.g. from a ruptured filter paper.  If suspended  material is present then discard the filtered sample and start again.  Screw on the lid tightly and place in the pre-addressed and postage-paid padded envelope along with  the pond water sample (if there is one).  Complete the sample information form (Fig 3) giving details  to aid the laboratory chemists at CEH Lancaster in identifying the sample and ensuring that the  subsequent measurements are assigned to the correct waterbody in the correct CS square.

The primary objective is to collect the widest range of animals possible from within the sample area,  using a sampling method that is comparable to that used in CS1990, CS2000 and that is compatible  with the RIVPACS bioassessment method.  For the purposes of macroinvertebrate sampling the sample area must be a single continuous area of  stream-bed whose major habitat types can be sampled within the recommended sampling period.  It  will normally vary from 5 to 15m according to stream width. It must not be a collection of separate  sampling points within an extended length of river, for instance to include both riffles and pools in an  attempt to increase the variety of animals captured.  Each habitat in the sampling area must be sampled with an effort proportional to its cover.  Within the  limitations imposed by this procedure, as many different taxa in the sampling area as possible should  be collected.  On average, about 60% of families present will be collected in a single three-minute  kick sample, excluding the manual search.  The sample shall be collected using a standard 25 cm2 pond-net with a 900 µm mesh net.  Wash the  net thoroughly before and after taking samples.  Check that it is neither damaged nor contaminated  with animals from previous samples.  Damaged pond nets must not be used.  Wherever possible, collect samples by sampling for three minutes with a pond-net and one minute of  manual searching (Fig 4).  The manual search is mandatory, although it will not always be fruitful.   The sampling area should not encompass such a wide range of features along the river that it includes  both deep and shallow areas.  There is no limit to the amount of material collected: only the sampling time controls the volume of  the sample.  Material collected in the net must be removed periodically, to prevent the mesh becoming blocked and  the sample being washed-out of the net.  As a minimum, this must be done after every minute of  sampling with a pond-net, and more frequently if the net is filling rapidly or becoming blocked.  Wash  fine sediment through the net more frequently than this, to minimise the amount retained in the  sample.  Large stones and pieces of vegetation (that may damage the net) can be discarded, but before  doing so, agitate them vigorously in the collecting net whilst it is half-submerged, to wash any animals  back into it.  Check that no animals are still attached before discarding this material.  Retain only enough water to keep the sample damp.  This reduces the amount of fixative or  preservative that has to be added to it, and reduces damage.  All specimens captured in the net must be retained in the sample for identification in the laboratory.  However you do not retain fish, amphibians, and readily identified rare species in the samples, such as  large specimens of the freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera) and crayfish, but return  them to the water with care and unharmed.  Record their presence in the sample on the RIVPACS  Sample Area Form.  If removed live for identification, then return them only to the site where they  were collected.  Bear in mind that it is particularly important to identify rare taxa correctly e.g. differentiating native  from introduced crayfish, because of their high conservation value and need for protection, so if there  is any doubt then retain the specimen in the sample.  Avoid sampling during and immediately after spates.  Samples collected in these conditions will not  accurately reflect the underlying environmental quality of the site. 12  1st part: MANUAL SEARCH  Seek and collect individual animals from the water surface.  Spend a total of one minute on the manual search, split between parts 1 and 3    2nd part: MAIN SAMPLE  Collect by either A, B or C  A -  shallow/wadeable  3 minute active pond-net sample collected by a combination of kicking and sweeping, depending on the nature  of the substratum, current and habitats, for benthos and free-swimming animals.  All habitats sampled in proportion to their cover.    B - too deep to kick sample whole site, but possible to sample at least some of the main channel with  pond-net  3 minute active pond-net sample collected by a combination of kicking and sweeping for benthos and free- swimming animals.  Attempt to sample all habitats in proportion to their cover, although this may not be possible for habitats in the  main channel    C - impossible to sample material from the main channel using a pond-net  3 minute sweep with pond-net to collect free-swimming animals and those from vegetation, but not the  benthos.    3rd part: MANUAL SEARCH  Search and collect individual animals from submerged rocks, logs or vegetation.  Spend a total of one minute on the manual search, split between parts 1 and 3    Figure 4  Summary of sampling procedures (modified from Murray-Bligh 1999). 13  Three-minute kick sample (modified from Murray-Bligh 1999).  The kick-net can be used in different ways depending on the nature of the survey area.  Different  habitats at the same site may be sampled by a combination of the methods described below.  The total  sampling time must be three minutes.  If a site comprises discrete habitats, apportion the sampling effort according to their cover in the  sampling area.  If a site appears to be homogeneous in character, continuous diagonal transects will  suffice for most of the sample.  Always move upstream and diagonally across the stream a number of times whilst sampling, rather  than straight upstream (Fig 5).  This will ensure that a greater number of habitats are sampled, even if  they are not apparent, and therefore a higher proportion of the taxa present at the site are collected.  The three minutes covers only the time spent actively sampling, and excludes the time spent emptying  the net, or moving around the site.  It is recommended that sampling is done in short bursts of 15-20  seconds.  There will be 9 to 12 bursts in a three minute sample, which is worth remembering when  apportioning the sampling effort to the different habitats.  A stopwatch must be used to ensure that the  cumulative time spent actively sampling is precisely three minutes.  With two people on-site, one  should time the sampling with the stopwatch while the other collects the sample.  The sampler should  call-out to the timekeeper when to start and stop the watch, and the timekeeper can remind the sampler  when each sampling burst should end.  Kick-net samples collected with less effort, in an attempt to prevent denuding sites on very small  watercourses, are not compatible with RIVPACS.  A longitudinal extension of the site will be  required in these streams.  In general, more material will be collected from lowland streams than from stony mountain streams.  Kick sampling from gravel or cobbles  When kick sampling, hold the net vertically with the frame at right-angles to the current, downstream  from your feet, and resting firmly on the river bed; disturb the stream bed vigorously by kicking or  rotating the heel of your boot to dislodge the substratum and the fauna within it to a depth of about 10  cm.  Hold the net close enough for the invertebrates to flow into the net with the current, but far  enough away for most of the sand and gravel to drop before entering the net.  Hold the net further  away where the substratum is finer or the current swifter, to prevent it clogging.  Move large stones by  hand if they cannot be shifted by foot, and sample the finer sediment that collects beneath them.  Sampling from soft sediments  Where the stream bed is soft silt or clay, kick sampling is ineffective because the net will become  blocked rapidly.  Instead, skim the bottom edge of the net gently through the top few centimetres of  the substratum, which is where most of the animals will be found.  Alternatively, stir-up the surface of  the sediment by foot or with the back of the net, and pass the open net through the clouded water.   Rinse the silt away through the net frequently, by agitating the net in the current or at the water  surface.  Sampling from boulders  It is not easy, and sometimes impossible, to take a kick sample amongst boulders.  Most of the  invertebrates will be in the finer deposits that accumulate under the boulders.  To reach them,  boulders may have to be moved by hand, though small ones may be prised away by foot.  Move  boulders away at right-angles to the current, or upstream and away from feet, so that the net can be  held downstream from the area disturbed.  Sample the exposed river bed by kicking in the normal  way. 14  It is impossible to sample effectively where the stream-bed is dominated by large boulders,  particularly near waterfalls or where the gradient is steep.  Replace these sites by ones that can be  sampled effectively.                                  Figure 5  Kick sampling from a shallow, fast-flowing stream.  The sampler is facing at right angles to the  current and is moving diagonally to the right and towards the photographer, for safety.  The  sampler is dislodging the substratum using his left foot and is holding the net close-by, in the  plume of disturbed sediment, to capture the animals that are dislodged.    Sampling from vegetation  Sample from submerged and emergent vegetation and tree roots by pushing the net into them with a  variety of forward, upward, and lateral movements.  Dislodge animals from dense tangles of tree roots  by kicking.  Sample the sediment that accumulates beneath plants by kicking or skimming the surface  of the sediment.  Do not overlook water under overhanging banks, because invertebrates may be  hiding there.  Sampling from still or slow-flowing water over gravel or cobbles  When sampling from still or slow-flowing water, a different procedure is necessary because there is  no current is to carry dislodged animals into the net.  Disturb the substratum with your feet and catch  the dislodged animals by sweeping the net through the water immediately above the disturbed area.   Use this technique wherever the current is weak, to supplement the methods described above.  Sampling from deep waters  In watercourses too deep for conventional kick-sampling, it is possible and to take a sweep sample  from the marginal vegetation and wadeable shoreline with the pond-net.  All habitats must be  sampled, where safe to do so.  If possible, use a combination of sweeping and kicking.  Wherever  pracitable , collect the sample from both banks.  In these circumstances you should sample each  habitat in proportion to its linear dominace along the river channel. 15  The sampling duration shall be three minutes of active sampling supplemented by a manual search.    Manual searching  The manual search is similar, whatever methods are used to collect the main sample.  Unlike the main  sample in which animals are collected without seeing them, individual animals seen by the sampler  are collected in the search and added to the main sample.  The search is in two parts which together last one minute.  The first part is to seek and collect animals  living on the water surface, such as whirligig beetles, water crickets and pond skaters.  This must be  done before any other sampling, because these animals are easily disturbed and will either leave the  sampling area or be much more difficult to find later.  They are best caught with a pond-net.  Most  surface dwellers are very active and they should be secured in a tied bag or vial immediately after  capture.  Whilst searching for these animals, note the area occupied by different habitats within the  sampling area, so that you can apportion the sampling effort amongst them in the main sample.  The second part of the search is for animals from habitats that are not sampled effectively by the  methods use to collect the main sample. Pick-off animals attached or clinging to the submerged stems  of emergent plants, rocks, logs, or other solid objects, with forceps or a stiff paint brush.  Examine  rocks at several places across the river to cover the different biotopes and areas covered by different  sized substrata.  Always search for animals attached to floating-leaved plants.  Inspect the under- surfaces of floating leaves as well as the upper surface and stems.  The whole search must last one minute.  It is standardised by time alone, and not by searching a  certain number of rocks or locations.  This period only covers the time spent actually searching, and  excludes the time spent moving around the site.  A stopwatch or watch with second hand must be used  to ensure that the cumulative time spent actively searching is one minute.  At some sites, the search  will be fruitless, either because no suitable or accessible places to search are found within the minute,  or because no animals are found in the places that are searched.  Even where the sampler suspects that  nothing will be found, the search must be undertaken honestly, to maintain consistency.  Sample fixing and storage  On completion of sampling, the sample should be emptied into a medium gauge, 18" x 12" polythene  bag as provided.  Intermediate emptying of the net after each minute’s active sampling is strongly  recommended and is essential if the net becomes so full as to preclude efficient sampling.  Rinse the sample, where possible by shaking the pond-net vigorously in the stream without risking  loosing any animals, to remove silt and clay. Discard stones, wood, and large fragments of vegetation  before removing the sample from the net but take care to remove any clinging animals and drop them  back in the pond-net.  The easiest way to remove a sample from the pond-net is to wash the catch into one corner of the net  first, by dipping the net into the water and gently shaking it from the opposite corner as it is lifted out  of the water.  Then, by gradually everting the corner of the net, the bulk of the sample can be dropped  into a labeled sample container, or polythene bag.  Material clinging to the net can be shaken, or  flicked-off from the other side of the net, into the container.  Repeat this process until the net is clear  of material.  Recalcitrant specimens may be picked-off the net by hand.  Always wash the collecting net thoroughly to prevent contaminating subsequent samples.  It is very easy to cross-contaminate samples from residual specimens retained on nets from previous  site visits.  Always wash pond nets as thoroughly as possible after sampling at each site and also  before sampling the next site. 16  Fill the sample containers to no more than about two thirds full with collected material.  This will  leave sufficient room for fixative or preservative, and an air space.  Never cram material into a sample  container, and never fill it completely: use an additional container instead.  Then, 40% formalin solution should be added to the sample bag until the liquor in the bag is  equivalent to 4% aqueous formaldehyde.  The precise amount of formalin needed varies from sample  to sample but is in the region of 50 - 100ml per plastic bag.  It is better to err on the side of excess.  A clear pencil-written label should be placed in the sample bag.  The label should contain the  following information:  Type of sample :  “macroinvert”  Square number :  Square number (e.g. 38)  Date    :  day-month-year (e.g. 07-08-07).  The plastic bag should be firmly tied and placed inside a 1.3 l storage pot and the lid of the pot tightly  closed.  An extra sharp twist of the lid is then recommended.  Apply PVC tape around the lid to form  a seal and to prevent the lid becoming loose during transport.  The pot should be clearly labeled on the outside, using a permanent marker, with the same  information as given on the internal label.  The sample may be split into two or more bags/pots if too large to fit within a single container.  All  parts of the sample should be labeled as above, together with the additional information “Part one of  two” or “Part two of two” or “Part one of three” etc.  Samples should very rarely require more than  one container.  Single containers should be adequate for the large majority of sites.  THOROUGH LABELLING OF SAMPLES IS ESSENTIAL  Surveyors should take at least six polythene bags, two sample pots and two bottles of 40%  formaldehyde to the survey square in case the macroinvertebrate sample is very large.  For transport, samples should be stored upright in the grey stacking trays provided. 17  Site environmental data (modified from Murray-Bligh 1999).  Site environmental data should be recorded for each macroinvertebrate sample.  For the purposes of  environmental data collection, the sample area is defined as the full width of the watercourse for the  full length sampled for macroinvertebrates.  The significance of the different definitions of sample area given for macroinvertebrate sampling and  environmental data collection is that sections of the watercourse too deep for macroinvertebrate  sampling are, nevertheless, included in width, depth and substratum evaluations.  When collecting environmental data, the objective should be to measure the modal conditions in the  Sampling Area at the time of sampling.  Avoid isolated features such as boulders or narrows, which  would cause the measurements to be atypical of the Sampling Area as a whole.  Choosing the best  place to measure these is easier when the Survey Area is restricted to a relatively discrete range of  physical conditions.  The environmental data shall be entered on the RIVPACS Sample Area form (Fig 6).  The following  instructions apply:  Square number:  e.g. 38  River Name:  Use river name from CS2000 data, make note if you think the name is incorrect.   For new sites, take name from map if indicated  Site Name:  Use site name from CS2000 data, make note if you think the name is incorrect.   For new sites, take appropriate site name from map.  Sample date:  Use the format: day-month-year (e.g. 07-08-06).  NGR:  Use GPS to record position of macroinvertebrate sampling site to at least 8- digit numeric national grid reference e.g. SY12345678  Recorders:  Enter the initials of both surveyors  Sample method:  Enter either:  Kick/sweep - disturbing the substratum with feet plus sweeping amongst plants  Kick - substratum disturbance but no sweeping  Sweep - sweeping amongst plants but no substratum disturbance  Sample time:  Enter time of active pond-netting (i.e. exclude search time).  In almost all or all  cases the time will be three minutes.  Proportionality:  Answer ‘No’ if the full width of the river for the full length of the sample area  is not sampled.  Only a simple explanation is required (e.g. “Not left-hand- bank.  Too deep”.  NOTE: left/right banks are determined looking  downstream).  Photograph:  A photograph is required of each sampling site.  The photograph should include  a numbered site board.  If possible it should also include a fixed natural or man- made feature of the site which can be helpful in re-location. 18  RIVPACS SAMPLE AREA FORM    CS2007 SQUARE No.:      RIVER:      SITE:    DATE:       NGR:          RECORDERS:    SAMPLE METHOD:  KICK   KICK/SWEEP   SWEEP  SAMPLE TIME (should be 3 mins active sampling plus 1 min manual search):    Is sampling proportional to occurrence of habitats?

The graduated pond-net handle can be used for width,  depth and surface velocity measurements.  Water width:  The stream width should reflect the predominant conditions in the sampling  area. Measure the stream width at right-angles to the channel.  Measure the  width of the water surface, not the stream channel, and include water under  overhanging banks.  If temporary islands form in the channel because of low flow, include them in  the measurement.  Choose a place to measure the width that gives an  approximately modal value for the site.  Alternatively, where the modal width is  difficult to estimate and it is safe and easy to cross the river, an average of more  than one measurement from the vicinity of the sampling area can be used,  although this should not normally be necessary.  Use the accurately marked kick-net handle to measure width.  On deep  watercourses, either estimate the stream width, making use of nearby bridges  (although sites should not be in the immediate vicinity of bridges), or use a  rangefinder.  Wherever possible, width should be measured rather than estimated.  As a  minimum, estimate widths of less than one metre to the nearest 10 cm; widths of  between one and two metres to the nearest 20 cm; and widths between two and  ten metres to the nearest 50 cm; and widths greater than ten metres to the  nearest metre.  Water depth:  The depth should reflect the predominant conditions in the sampling area.   Depth should be based on the average of measurements from approximately a  quarter, half, and three-quarter distance along a transect across the stream in the  sampling area.  Do not measure depth where it is atypical of the site, for instance over or close  to boulders.  When a temporary island appears in mid-channel, the depth there  will be zero, and should be recorded as such.  Where the stream is wadeable, record the depth to the nearest centimetre.   Where the depth has to be estimated, record depths to 1 m to the nearest 10 cm,  and greater depths to the nearest 50 cm.  Surface velocity:  Current velocity must be measured only in Scotland and its offshore islands.  The measurements refer to the typical surface velocity in the main flow channel.   Dead water areas and atypically fast flowing areas should be avoided.  The  measurements should refer to the surface velocity in the main flow channel.  The time that it takes for a floating object (e.g. a leaf of a twig) to travel a  known distance can be used to measure the velocity.  If the object is thrown into  the current, measurements should not be started until initial inertia of the object  is overcome.  Results should be measured in cm s-1.  For preference, the object should be measured over a 10 metre run with a  relatively constant current speed. This may not be possible in small streams or  where the character of the river changes rapidly.  In this case, the same guiding  principles recommending for selecting the position of depth measurements  should also apply to current velocity, and the object can be timed against the  pond-net handle.  It is important that current velocity is measured accurately as possible.  Poor  runs of the floating object should be discarded and the estimated category 20  should ideally be based on the modal or median value of at least three timed  runs on each visit.  Current velocities are recorded using the categories shown in  Table 1.  Table 1  Velocity categories for RIVPACS                Substratum:  The composition of the stream bed must be assessed over the whole sampling  area, i.e. the full width of river along the whole length sampled, even if some  parts of it are inaccessible for sampling.  Visual estimates of four categories of  particle size are required (Table 2, Fig 7).  Estimates must be based on a bird’s-eye view of the superficial stream-bed layer  and should include both particles which are visible and those which would be  visible in the absence of plant-growth.  The percentage cover of the stream-bed  occupied by each of the four size categories should be recorded.  THE FOUR  VALUES SHOULD ALWAYS TOTAL 100%.  Estimates should exclude bedrock which is recorded on a separate part of the  recording form.  A peat stream-bed should be recorded as silt.  Clay can either  be areas of soft fine particles or a continuous sheet.  A fine layer of silt or clay through which the shape of the underlying stones can  be seen should be typed according to the underlying substratum, but if the  shapes of the underlying stones are not distinct, the silt or clay should be  recorded instead.  Compacted clay should be recorded as clay, even when  broken-up into gravel-sized fragments.  Experience has shown that cover estimates are improved if both surveyors  estimate percentage cover at the same site and compare results.  Fig 8 may be  used as a guide to how best to estimate cover.  Copies of the figure could be  attached to the back of clipboards and used as an aid in the field.  Walk along the river bank and make a preliminary note of the substratum after  any surface-living animals have been collected.  These initial evaluations will be  particularly useful at silty sites, and will be necessary for apportioning the  sampling effort.  After the rest of the biological sample has been collected, walk  over the whole sampling area before making the final estimates.  It is difficult to  judge the composition of the river bed in deep or turbid water.  The substratum  visible at the water's edge, the feel of the stream-bed under foot, the contents of  the sampling net, previously recorded data, and local knowledge may all be used  as guides.

The purpose of the sketch map is to enable future relocation of the site.  Keep this fact in  mind when drawing the map.  Draw a sketch of approximately 50 m of river channel indicating the general physical character of the  site and incorporating the macroinvertebrate sampling area.  This should include permanent reference  features (such as a distance from a bridge or footpath sign) which would enable anyone else to find  the site with adequate precision in the future.  Main features to mark on sketch map:  •  General form of river channel, including islands, flow direction and prominent bank features  •  Relocation features - for both ends of the survey length if possible.  These should be near  permanent landmarks such as hedgerows, fence lines, walls, electricity pylons, roads, bridges,  buildings etc.  •  Record distances from/ between features  •  Grid north (found from OS map) and estimated scale e.g. indicate on map what length is 10 m.  •  Adjacent land use - for example woodland, arable, pasture, factory, waste, set aside  •  Extent of macroinvertebrate sampling area  •  Location from where photos were taken.  •  Any potential hazards. 25  River Habitat Survey  General principle  An assessment of the hydromorphological diversity and condition of river reaches was carried out as  part of CS2000 using the 1997 version of the River Habitat Survey form (Raven et al. 1998).  Since  then the RHS protocols has been updated and a 2003 version of the method is now available  (Environment Agency 2003) and will be used for CS2007.  The changes between the two versions  affect the way the RHS indices are calculated but values will still be comparable between the two  versions.  The 2003 RHS protocol is described in detail in the guidance manual provided along with the training  course and therefore will not be covered in detail here.  All CS2007 surveyors will receive RHS  training and accreditation in the2003 version from the Environment Agency RHS team.  We will be using a field digital data entry system, called RAPID, to record the RHS data on site.  This  will reduce the likelihood of errors associated with transferring data from paper copy to a database,  and will allow more effective use of staff time.  There is also the added benefit of being able to  validate the entered data while the surveyor is still on-site, thus improving data quality.  A copy of the  2003 RHS field survey guidance manual will be easily accessible from RAPID on the Tablet PC.  The  design of RAPID and the format of data entry mimics the 2003 RHS form and therefore should be  easily understood by an accredited RHS surveyor.  The RHS section will be 500 m long and will be centred (wherever possible) on the selected  macroinvertebrate sampling site.  The survey will be undertaken irrespective of whether there is flow  or not in that section of the watercourse and, hence, whether or not a macroinvertebrate sample was  collected.  In some circumstances it may not be possible to centre the survey on the macroinvertebrate  sampling site nor to survey a full 500m.  A number of reasons for this are envisaged and rules for  dealing with each circumstance have been devised (Fig 2).  Field surveyors should seek advice from  senior CEH staff if any other circumstances are encountered.  RAPID is an MS Access database designed to capture and store RHS data in the field using a Tablet  PC.  You simply double-click the RAPID icon on the desktop to open the application.  Then you  select from the opening form whether you wish to input survey data for a new site, export data from  an existing site or exit the database (Fig 9).                          Figure 9   Desktop icon and screen shot of the opening menu of the River Habitat Survey field digital  data entry system (RAPID). 26  Inputting survey data  The data entry form consists of 17 sections across 4 pages.  Pages 1, 3 and 4 gather general survey  information and data for the sweep-up part of the RHS.  Page 2 is where the spot-check data is entered.   You can switch between the four pages using page buttons at the top of the window (Fig 10).  Most data fields are drop-down lists.  This reduces the amount of text that needs to be entered using  the Tablet PC stylus and also improves data quality because it means that inappropriate codes cannot  be entered.  By default all data fields are set at ‘-9’ or ‘missing value’ until you interact with them and  enter an appropriate piece of information.  In completing an RHS form all ‘-9s’ and ‘missing value’  selections are replaced by data.                                                        Figure 10  Screen shot of part of Page 1 of RAPID.    The purpose of the buttons at the top of the window (Figure 10) is as follows: 27  About database: provides basic contact details and ownership information.  Main menu: returns you to the opening menu screen of RAPID  Survey Notes: opens a text box linked to a particular survey, for entering necessary field notes  RHS manual: opens an electronic version of the 2003 RHS guidance manual, complete with example  pictures of all hydromorphological features recorded in a survey.  Check Data: on completion of an RHS survey you must press this button to validate the data you have  entered.  RAPID will check, sequentially from the start of the form to the finish, for data fields that  have been left empty by mistake and where possible, for inconsistencies in the data entered.  RAPID  will only display one error at a time (so that you have the opportunity to correct the problem).  Once  you have corrected the problem you must press the Check Data button again to find the next error (if  there is one).  Once the validation is successfully finished, RAPID produces a message ‘This RHS  survey appears to be complete’.  This validation must be performed before you leave the site, in order  that any omissions can be accurately corrected.    When you select ‘Input Survey data’ from the main menu you are first asked to select the CS square  for which you wish to enter data.  Use the ‘Select Square’ drop down list in the top right-hand corner  of the window.  You then proceed to complete the form as normal, complying with standard RHS protocol, ensuring  that all fields are completed.  IF, FOR WHATEVER REASON, YOU CANNOT CARRY OUT THE RHS AT A SQUARE, THEN YOU SHOULD  STILL SELECT THAT SQAURE IN RAPID, ENTER THE DATE, SURVEYOR NAME AND IN THE SURVEY NOTES  PROVIDE A REASON FOR NOT COMPLETING THE SURVEY.  Page 1  Section A Field Survey Details: You must record the GPS-derived NGR for spot-check 1, 6 and 50m  beyond spot-check 10.  This can be done by returning to this section as you proceed through  the survey.  By clicking the ‘Today’ button adjacent to the box you can automatically  complete the box with that day’s date.  Select the surveyor’s name and RHS accreditation  code from the drop-down list.  You are asked to decide whether the watercourse is natural or  artificial.  The associated help button provides definitions for both types of watercourse.  Section B Valley Form: This section does not differ in content from the paper form, but has a slightly  different arrangement of the options.  Section C Number of Riffles, Pools and Point Bars: This section does not differ in content from the  paper form.  Section D Artificial Features: This section does not differ in content from the paper form, but has a  slightly different arrangement of the options.  You should first tick the box near the top-left of  the section which will turn all the -9s in the section to zeros.  Then you can enter counts for  those artificial features that are present, if any.    Page 2: Spot-checks  The design of Page 2 differs from that of the paper form.  Each of the 10 spot-checks and the summary  channel vegetation and extra substrate section are on separate tabbed pages nested within Page 2.  A  blue bar underneath the tab numbers indicates which tab is currently selected (Fig 11).  The drop-down  boxes provide you with all valid options, both in code and with description, for each spot-check  attribute.  This design aids data-entry.  You are reminded on the tabs for spot-checks 1, 6 and 10 to  record the GPS readings.  You must record whether Spot-check 1 is at the up- or downstream end of  the site.  This is recorded in the drop-down box above the tabbed section (Fig 11). 28  Each spot-check tab also features a ‘Check’ button (located at the right-hand side of Section F) which,  when clicked, will confirm that there are no missing data or omissions for that spot-check.  It is good  practice to use this button before you move to the next spot-check to ensure that you have completed  all the necessary tasks.                                          Figure 11  Screen shot of the Page 2 spot-check form in RAPID.    Section E Physical Attributes: This section does not differ in content from the paper form, but has a  slightly different arrangement of the options.  You are allowed to enter a maximum of two  codes for bank modifications and marginal& bank features on each bank.  If you need to enter  more than two codes then use the survey notes.  The same applies for channel modifications  and features.  It should be noted that you nee to interact with all the drop-downs.  So even if  you wish to record only one bank modification sat this spot-check, you still need to change the  optional second drop-down to NO (none).  Section F Banktop Land-use and Vegetation Structure: This section does not differ in content from the  paper form, but has a slightly different arrangement of the options.  Section G Channel Vegetation Types: This section does not differ in content from the paper form, but  has a slightly different arrangement of the options.  If there are some vegetation types present you will need to interact with all boxes, even those  for types not present, to actively record that they are absent. 29  If there is no channel vegetation, or less than 1% channel vegetation, at the spot-check, then  select ‘No plants’ from the ‘Update all to:’ drop-down to the right in the blue section header  bar (Fig 11).  This will enter NO in all the boxes.  If the water is too turbid to make a judgement on the presence of submerged vegetation forms  then you should select ‘Submerged plants not visible’ from the ‘Update all to:’ drop-down.   This will enter NV in the boxes for the three submerged vegetation types.  If it is not possible to see the channel from your position at this spot-check and you therefore  cannot make any judgement on the presence of vegetation in the channel you can select  ‘Whole channel not visible’ from the ‘Update all to:’ drop-down.  This will enter NV in boxes  for all vegetation types.    The last spot-check tab on page 2 (‘Overall tab’) is for entering extra channel substrates that were not  not recorded in any of the 10 spot-checks but are present in >1% of the whole 500 m site (Fig 12).  A  summary of the substrates that were recorded at the 10 spot-checks is provided to the right of the drop- down boxes.  If there are no extra substrates to record then you must still interact with all three boxes,  entering ‘None’.  The Overall tab on Page 2 also contains a section for recording the overall presence of vegetation  types present along the whole 500 m site (Fig 12).  This could also include types not recorded in any  of the spot-checks.  Only record vegetation types that cover >1% of the whole 500 m site.  Next to  each drop-down box there is a tally of the number of times that vegetation type has been recorded as  present or extensive in the 10 spot-checks.  This should assist you in completing this section.  Again  all boxes will need to be interacted with to remove -9s.                                Figure 12  Screen shot of the Overall tab on the Page 2 spot-check form in RAPID. 30  Page 3: 500 m Sweep-up  Section H Land-use within 50 m of Banktop: This section does not differ in content from the paper  form, and has an almost identical arrangement of the options (Fig 13).  You should first tick  the box near the top-left of the section which will turn all the -9s in the section to zeros.  Then  you can enter data for those land-uses that are present.  Section I Bank Profiles: This section does not differ in content from the paper form, and has an almost  identical arrangement of the options (Fig 13).  You should first tick the box near the top-left of  the section which will turn all the -9s in the section to zeros.  Then you can enter data for those  natural and artificial/modified bank profiles that are present.                                                      Figure 13  Screen shot of upper half of Page 3 form in RAPID.    Section J Extent of Tress and Associated Features: This section does not differ in content from the  paper form, but does have a slightly different arrangement of the options (Fig 14).  If there are 31  no trees or none of the associated features present at the RHS site then you can just tick the  box in the top left-hand corner of the section to move all the -9s to zeros.  Alternatively you  just complete each of the drop-down boxes appropriately.  Section K Extent of Channel and Bank Features: This section does not differ in content from the paper  form, and has an almost identical arrangement of the options (Fig 14).  You should first tick  the box near the top-left of the section which will turn all the -9s in the section to zeros.  Then  you can enter data for those features that are present.                                                    Figure 14  Screen shot of lower half of Page 3 form in RAPID. 32  Page 4: Dimensions and Influences  Section L Channel Dimensions: This section does not differ in content from the paper form, and has a  similar layout.  Use the numerical drop-down lists to record the measured dimensions (Fig 15).  Section M Features of Special Interest: This section does not differ in content from the paper form,  and has an almost identical arrangement of the options (Fig 15).  You should first tick the box  near the top-left of the section which will turn all the -9s in the section to zeros.  Then you can  enter data for those features that are present.                                                        Figure 15  Screen shot of upper half of Page 4 form in RAPID. 33  Section N Choked Channel: This section does not differ in content from the paper form, and has a  similar layout (Fig 16).  Section O Notable Nuisance Plant Species: This section does not differ in content from the paper form,  and has an almost identical arrangement of the options (Fig 16).  You should first tick the box  near the top-left of the section which will turn all the -9s in the section to zeros.  Then you can  enter data for those plant species that are present.  Section P Overall Characteristics: This section does not differ in content from the paper form.   However it does have a different arrangement of the options (Fig 16).  You should first tick the  box near the top-left of the section which will turn all the -9s in the section to zeros.  Then you  can select from the drop-down menu those characteristics that are present.  Up to six different  characteristics can be recorded within each category.  If more are required then use the survey  notes page.  Section S Alders: This section does not differ in content from the paper form, and has a similar layout  (Fig 16).                                                  Figure 16  Screen shot of lower half of Page 4 form in RAPID. 34  Validating data  Once you have completed the survey you must validate the form, while still at the site in order that any  omissions can be accurately corrected.  RAPID has an in-built validation routine that can be activated  by pressing the ‘Check data’ button at the top left hand corner of the window.  RAPID will check,  sequentially from the start of the form to the finish, for data fields that have been left empty by mistake  and where possible, for inconsistencies in the data entered.  RAPID will only display one error at a  time (so that you have the opportunity to correct the problem).  Once you have corrected the problem  you must press the Check Data button again to find the next error (if there is one).  Once the validation  is successfully finished, RAPID produces a message ‘This RHS survey appears to be complete’ (Fig  17).  You can now close down RAPID by returning to the main menu and clicking EXIT.                                              Figure 17  Screen shot of the completed form in RAPID. 35  Aquatic plant survey  General principle  The aquatic plant (macrophytes and bryophytes) survey method used in CS2000 will be repeated for  CS2007.  The simple field protocol is based on that described for the Mean Trophic Rank (MTR)  bioassessment method (Holmes et al. 1999).  The MTR system is a biological method to assess the trophic status of streams and rivers in the UK  and was primarily developed to monitor the impacts of eutrophication.  The MTR system is based on  the presence and abundance of species of aquatic macrophyte.  A macrophyte is defined as ‘any plant  observable with the naked eye and nearly always identifiable when observed’ (Holmes & Whitton  1977).  This definition includes all higher aquatic plants, vascular cryptograms and bryophytes,  together with groups of algae which can be seen to be composed predominantly of a single species  (Holmes et al. 1999).  A 100 m reach of watercourse is carefully walked by the surveyor and the presence and cover (on a 9- point scale) of all macrophyte and bryophyte species is recorded.  The 100 m reach is centred on the  macroinvertebrate sampling location.  Supplementary information is also collected on the physical  nature of the 100 m reach.  The surveyor is encouraged to collect samples of plants that it is not  possible to confidently identify in the field.  These are identified in the laboratory and/or passed to a  designated external expert for confirmation.  Only those plants seen submerged or partly submerged in the river, at low flow levels, within the 100  m survey length are included.  At the sides of the channel all macrophytes rooted or attached on parts  of the substrata which are likely to be submerged for more than 85% of the year are also included  (Holmes et al. 1999).  Survey technique (from Holmes et al. 1999)  You must first define the 100 m survey length by measuring out 50 m upstream and 50 m downstream  of the centrepoint of the macroinvertebrate sampling site (Fig 1).  You will be provided with copies of  the hand-drawn MTR survey length sketch maps from CS2000 which will aid you in relocating the  100 m survey length.  At sites where it is safe to do so, the full 100 m survey length and channel width should be surveyed  by wading through the stream.  Wading should be in an upstream direction so that any substrate  disturbed does not obscure the visibility of the survey length, both for ease of observation and safety  reasons.  Where all but a small proportion (<20%) of the survey length is accessible by wading it is acceptable  to walk for a short distance along the banks observing the macrophytes and to investigate submerged  macrophytes using a grapnel.  You should wade in a zig-zag manner across the channel, frequently investigating all habitat types  present.  You should cross the channel a minimum of 4 times in each 10 m stretch (Fig 18).  At sites where the channel is too deep to wade, if channel macrophytes can be clearly seen by walking  along both banks then this is sufficient.  Use a grapnel to retrieve macrophyte species from the  channel for identification.  The grapnel should not be used blindly to ‘search’ for plants; its use  should be reserved only for retrieving specimens for identification or to determine if macrophytes are  present.  Grapnels should be used with care as they can cause damage to plant beds; this is  particularly pertinent in areas of high conservation value.  As you wade/walk you should record the species present (calling out species names to the recorder  following along bankside) and think about the percentage of the 10 m survey areas covered by each  species.  Take particular care to examine all small niches within the survey site to look for small  patches (<25 cm2) of species.  Such patches are easily overlooked but their omission can result in  substantial error in the final site assessment. 36                    Figure 18  Diagrammatic representation of wading technique that should be adopted for every 10 m of an  MTR survey.  Detached macrophyte material, except for actual floating macrophyte species such as Lemna sp. and  Azolla, should be disregarded.  If a macrophyte is stranded above the water e.g. in low flow  conditions, then it should not be recorded on the standard list.  A note of the species, should however,  be made in the survey notes along with observations of the amount stranded and any obvious reasons  for stranding.  Specimens attached to artificial structures should be recorded but with a note made in the survey  notes stating the nature of the structure.  Once all macrophyte species in the survey length have been recorded, wade/walk back along the the  survey length, specifically observing the amount of each species present and the overall percentage of  the channel covered by macrophyte growth.  For all percentage cover estimates of species, the whole survey area surveyed equals 100%, i.e. the  individual species percentage cover estimates are a percentage of the whole survey area and NOT of  the overall percentage cover estimate.  It is good practice to consult with the other surveyor when estimating percentage cover.  Record the  agreed species cover value (Table 3) for each species and the overall percentage cover of  macrophytes.  If you estimate that the percentage cover for a species is exactly on the boundary  between two species cover values, then you should record it as the higher (greater cover) of the two  categories.  Table 3 Species cover categories for a 100 m MTR survey  Species Cover Value  Percentage cover range  1  <0.1%  2  0.1 – 1%  3  1 – 2.5%  4  2.5 – 5%  5  5 – 10%  6  10 – 25%  7  25 – 50%  8  50 – 75%  9  >75%    0 m  10 m  Right  Bank  Left  Bank  Flow 37  When assigning percentage cover to species and estimating overall percentage cover, it is strongly  recommended that you use a systematic approach to make the process easier and more accurate.  Percentage cover should be estimated by imagining a bird’s eye view of the channel. For estimates of  individual species, it is necessary to imagine the cover of each, regardless of whether several species  are intermingled or overlap.  Percentage cover estimation of filamentous algae can be particularly  difficult. Determine whether the algae are forming a continuous or broken covering of the substrate.  For both overall percentage cover and individual species cover estimation it is useful to calculate what  a one metre square patch of macrophyte represents for each survey length, eg 0.01%, 0.5% etc, before  commencing surveying.  As a double-check when estimating small areas of cover, it may be useful to  work out beforehand the area of pieces of survey equipment, and use these for reference: for example,  an A4 sheet (0.06 m2).                                                      Suggested techniques for estimating overall macrophyte percentage cover  Option 1: Imagine moving all the macrophytes to the one end of the survey length.  The area covered will  correspond to the overall percentage cover, for example in a 100m survey length an area of macrophytes  completely covering a section which is 25m long x channel width will have 25% cover.  Option 2: If the majority of the vegetation is confined to strips along the margins of the river, the overall  percentage cover may be estimated in the following manner:  Marginal area covered, m2 = length of marginal vegetation cover x width of marginal vegetation  Total area covered, m2 = marginal area + other areas  Total percentage cover = [(total area covered)/(total area of survey length)] x 100  Suggested techniques for estimating indivdual macrophyte species percentage cover  Square meter method:  1. Estimate the approximate average width of the channel.  2. Calculate the equivalent m2 areas that need to be covered in order for a macrophyte to be awarded a  particular species cover value.  Refer to Table 4, highlight the most appropriate channel width column and  use this as a guide.  3. Estimate the m2 cover of each species within the survey length and allocate the appropriate species cover  value.  Example  For a 100m survey length, channel width 5 m, a macrophyte must cover the following areas:    Species Cover Value  Percentage cover range  Equivalent area (m2)  1  <0.1%  < 0.5  2  0.1 – 1%  0.5 - 5  3  1 – 2.5%  5 - 12.5  4  2.5 – 5%  12.5 - 25  5  5 – 10%  25 - 50  6  10 – 25%  50 - 125  7  25 – 50%  125 - 250  8  50 – 75%  250 - 375  9  >75%  > 375  A macrophyte covering 6m2 would be recorded as species cover value 3.  These figures need to be  recalculated for ANY DIFFERENCE in channel width. 38  Table 4 An aid to converting surface areas (m2) within a 100m MTR survey length to percentage cover and ultimately a species cover value, for channels of different widths.

We have produced a list of 351  plant taxa that we believe contains all the aquatic macrophytes that are likely to be recorded  during CS2007.  This list also acts as the standard for the taxonomic level to which  specimens should be taken when being identified.  For example we would expect Carex to be  identified to species level but would not expect Salix to be taken beyond genus.  We would  hope that the vast majority of specimens could be taken to species.  Use a field identification guide.  If identification to species level is expected but cannot be  achieved due to the absence of key/seasonal features e.g. flowers, then record it only to the  level to which you are confident.  If you are unable to confidently identify a species in the  field due to being unfamiliar to you then you should take a representative sample back to the  laboratory for confirmation.  This should be a placed in a plastic bag or tube without water  and labelled with the CS Square number and temporary ID code e.g. 160_01 and date.  This  coding should match that recorded on the MTR form so that the confirmed identification can  be linked back to the appropriate survey.  This is particularly important when more than one  macrophyte from the same survey needs further investigation.  Particular care should be taken over the identification of Ranunculus species, as it is known  that mis-identification of Ranunculus species is a common cause of surveyor error.  If in  doubt, a representative sample should be taken back to the laboratory for confirmation of  identification, or identification confirmed by an expert.  Where you are confident that two or  even more species or apparently differing forms of Ranunculus are present, but you cannot be  confident about the precise species, then it is preferable to take sample specimens for  confirmation back in the laboratory.  Representative samples of algae and bryophytes should be taken to the laboratory for closer  examination so that their identification can be confirmed.  Assessing and recording physical variables (from Holmes et al. 1999)  After recording the macrophyte information re-traverse the survey length, recording details of  the survey length physical variables (water width, depth, bed stability, substrate composition,  habitats, channel shading and water clarity).  The assessment of physical variables is NOT  expected to be as precise as the macrophyte assessments, but merely an important element  which should be used to help in:  i) Assessment of how comparable sites are to one another.  ii) Providing information which in the future may help in more rigorously assessing  the relationship between macrophytes and physical variables.  Orientation of the left and right banks is determined by the direction of flow. When facing  downstream, the left bank is on your left hand side and the right bank on your right hand side.  Recording of features which are present in less than 1% of the survey area will not usually be  required unless that particular habitat type contains the only occurrence of a particular  macrophyte species.  If this is necessary then use the survey notes to record the feature with a  cover of <1%.  Water width: The width is the channel width for which macrophyte species have been  recorded, including any area of substratum above the actual water level that has been  surveyed.  If the width varies noticeably along the survey length then several width  measurements should be made.  Record varying widths by entering the percentage of  the 100 m survey length in each width category.  The total must sum to 100%. 40  Depth: Measure the depth to the nearest cm at various points along the survey length — the  number and exact location of the measurement points should depend on the variability  of depths encountered when surveying for macrophytes.  Record the percentage of the  survey length in each of the depth category.  The total must sum to 100%.    Bed stability: The following 4 classes are used to define bed stability:      Solid/firmly bedded - eg bedrock/compacted clay, increased flow has little  effect      Stable - eg boulders/pebbles/gravel, unlikely to be significantly altered by  increased flows      Unstable - eg gravel/sand/silt/mud, likely to be dislodged by increased flows      Soft/sinking - eg deep silt/mud, makes channel unwadeable, bank stick  penetrates easily into substrate.  Record the percentage of the channel in each of the above bed stability categories.   The total must sum to 100%.  Substrate: Estimates should be based on a birds-eye view and should only include particles  which are visible and the equivalent superficial layer under macrophytes. If shapes of  underlying larger particles are distinct under a layer of fine particles such as silt or  clay then the larger particles should be recorded. When the shapes of underlying  particles are not distinct then the fine particles should be recorded. If you feel this is  not sufficient then extra information can be recorded in the Survey Notes.  Record the percentage cover for each substrate type present in the survey length.  The  total must sum to 100%.  The substrata classes are:  Bedrock - exposure of underlying rock not covered by alluvial deposits    Boulders/Cobbles - > 64mm (half-fist size or larger)    Pebbles/Gravel - > 2–64 mm (half fist to coffee granule size)    Sand - > 0.0625–2mm (smaller than coffee granules and unlike silt/clay,  abrasive to the hands)    Silt/Clay - < 0.0625mm (have a soft texture)     Peat - dead vegetation undergoing bacterial decay in stagnant deoxygenated  water – strictly pure peat, not fine peaty deposits over more substantial  substrate.     Artificial – man-made substrates in the channel e.g. concrete bed.  See Fig 7 in RIVPACS site environmental data section for illustration of different  substrate sizes.  The actual measurements given relate to the longest axis of each particle. Any rock  with one or more sides greater than 256mm long is classed as a boulder.  When  irregular shaped particles are observed the longest axis length determines category  assignment. 41  Habitats: Record the percentage cover for each habitat type present within the survey length.   The habitat types are POOL, RUN, RIFFLE and SLACK, as defined below.  The total  must sum to 100%.  Note that although these definitions are similar to those used for many other  biological surveys, they are NOT the definitions used for the River Habitat Survey  methodology (Environment Agency 2003).  Pool - Either a discrete area of slow flowing water, usually relatively deeper  than surrounding water, or between faster flowing stretches, as in a sequence  of riffle-pool- riffle.  Pools are deep and often turbulent, and scoured during  spate flows.  Riffle - Fast flowing, shallow water whose surface is distinctly disturbed.   This does not include water whose surface is disturbed by macrophyte growth  only.  Run - Fast or moderate flowing, often deeper water whose surface is rarely  brokenor disturbed except for occasional swirls and eddies.  Slack - Deep, slow flowing water, uniform in character.  Channel shading: Record the percentage of the channel area affected by shading, NOT the  percentage of the bank on which vegetation causing shade stands.  The shading for  each bank is recorded separately.  Estimate the percentage of the whole channel area  surveyed that is shaded by vegetation/structures from the left bank when the sun is  directly overhead (ie at 12 noon).  In a similar manner, estimate the percentage of the  whole channel shaded from the right bank.  The total for each bank must sum to  100%.  Three shade categories, none, broken and dense, are defined:  None - no shading  Broken - some direct sunlight hits the water surface in the shade-affected area  when the sun is directly overhead.  Dense - 5% or less of the shade-affected area receives direct sunlight when  the sun is directly overhead.  Water clarity: Record the percentage of the channel in each water clarity category.  More than  one category may be present as a survey length may be clear in the shallow margins  and progress through cloudy to turbid as the water depth increases.  Clear - Channel substrate is clearly visible at all depths, as are macrophyte  species.  Cloudy - Slightly discoloured with a moderate load of suspended solids and  partially reduced light penetration.  All clumps of macrophyte species can be  located on the substrate of the river channel but the view of them is partially  distorted.  A small piece/single shoot of a macrophyte species may be missed.  Turbid - Strongly discoloured, carrying a heavy load of suspended solids and  having greatly restricted light penetration.  The channel bed is obscured and  submerged macrophyte species are indistinguishable from substrate and  water.  This will lead to a reduction in accuracy and efficiency of the method. 42  IRIS  We will be using a field digital data entry system, called IRIS, to record the aquatic plant  survey data in the field.  This will reduce the likelihood of errors associated with transferring  data from paper copy to a database and save staff time.  The design of IRIS is based on that of the paper forms used for carrying out standard MTR  surveys.  IRIS is an MS Access database designed to capture and store aquatic plant cover data in the  field using a tablet PC.  You simply double-click the IRIS icon on the desktop to open the application.  Then you select from the opening form whether you wish to input survey data for a new site,  export data from an existing site or exit the database (Fig 19).                  Figure 19  Desktop icon and screen shot of the opening menu screen of IRIS, the aquatic plant  survey field digital data entry system.  The data entry form consists of 2 pages.  Page 1 gathers general survey information and the  plant cover data (Fig 20).  Page 2 is where the physical site data is entered.  You can switch  between the pages using the page buttons at the top of the window (Fig 20).  Most data fields are drop-down lists.  This reduces the amount of text that needs to be entered  using the tablet PC stylus and also improves data quality because it means that inappropriate  data cannot be entered.  The purpose of the other buttons at the top of the window (Fig 20) is as follows:  About database: provides basic contact details and ownership information.  Main menu: returns you to the opening menu screen of IRIS.  Survey Notes: opens a text box linked to a particular survey, for entering necessary field  notes.  Check Data: on completion of an aquatic plant survey you must press this button to validate  the data you have entered.  IRIS will check, sequentially from the start of the form to the  finish, for data fields that have been left empty by mistake and where possible, for  inconsistencies in the data entered.  IRIS will only display one error at a time (so that you have the opportunity to correct the  problem).  Once you have corrected the problem you must press the ‘Check Data’ button  again to find the next error (if there is one).  Once the validation is successfully finished, IRIS  produces a message ‘This plant survey appears to be complete’. 43  This validation must be performed before you leave the site, in order that any omissions can  be accurately corrected.    Inputting survey data  The first task when inputting survey data is to select the Countryside Survey square that you  are in.  Use the ‘Select Square’ drop down list.  Enter the date and the name of the surveyor in the river actually carrying out the survey (not  the recorder holding the tablet PC).  Also record the NGR of the mid-point of the site.  This  should also be the mid-point of the macroinvertebrate sampling area.  IF, FOR WHATEVER REASON, YOU CANNOT CARRY OUT THE PLANT SURVEY AT A SQUARE, THEN  YOU SHOULD STILL SELECT THAT SQAURE IN IRIS, ENTER THE DATE, SURVEYOR NAME AND IN  THE SURVEY NOTES PROVIDE A REASON FOR NOT COMPLETING THE SURVEY.  You then proceed to complete the form as normal, complying with standard MTR protocols,  described above, and ensuring that all fields are completed.  You add species to the list (from the drop-down menu) as you find them within the 100 m site  and you then allocate a cover category to each species based on its % cover within the survey  site.  Species are listed according to major group (Fungi, Algae, Moss, Liverworts, Horsetails &  Quillworts, Ferns, Monocotyledons, and Dicotyledons) and then within a group they are  alphabetically ordered.  A species entry can be deleted by right-clicking on the grey squares to the left of the species  name and selecting ‘Cut’ and then clicking ‘Yes’.                                Figure 20  Screen shot of the aquatic plant survey field digital data entry system (IRIS). 44  IF THERE ARE NO PLANTS RECORDED IN 100M STRECTH THEN SELECT ‘NO SPECIES ENTERED’  FROM THE DROP-DOWN SPECIES LIST.  YOU MUST STILL RECORD THE PHYSICAL DATA ON PAGE  2 OF THE FORM EVEN IF NO PLANTS ARE FOUND.  Specimen samples of any plants that you have been unable to identify need to be taken for  identification by experts.  These samples need bagged and labelled correctly to ensure that  once identified the information can be inserted into the right survey.  IRIS has pre-named  entries in the drop down-list for indeterminate mosses, algae and others e.g. Algae 01, Moss  01, Other 01.  Further details of the number of Algae, Moss and Other sample specimens taken and how they  were labelled needs to be entered for reference, at the bottom of page 1 (Fig 21).  IRIS  suggests a consistent format for labelling sample specimens i.e. 15_Main Moss 1 where the  first number is the CS square and the second term is the number of that moss specimen from  that survey.                                      Figure 21  Screen shot of page 1 of IRIS    On Page 2 of IRIS you record the physical data for the survey length (Fig 22).  For each of the  seven physical features for which you are recording data (water width, depth, bed stability,  substrate composition, habitats, channel shading and water clarity) you simply select the  category present at the site from the drop-down list and assign a percentage cover value to the  category from the adjacent drop-down list.  IRIS will tally up the percentages automatically to 45  ensure that the total 100%.  The ‘SUM’ boxes go from red to grey when the total equals  100%.  You should also record how many photographs you have taken and provide some  accompanying notes.  Once you have completed the survey you must validate the form, while still at the site, in  order that any omissions can be accurately corrected.  Click the ‘Check Data’ button to  validate the data you have entered.  IRIS will check, sequentially from the start of the form to  the finish, for data fields that have been left empty by mistake and where possible, for  inconsistencies in the data entered.                                                      Figure 22  Screen shot of the Page 2 form in IRIS. 46    IRIS will only display one error at a time (so that you have the opportunity to correct the  problem).  Once you have corrected the problem you must press the ‘Check Data’ button  again to find the next error (if there is one).  Once the validation is successfully finished, IRIS  produces a message; ‘This plant survey appears to be complete’ (Fig. 23).  You can now close down RAPID by returning to the main menu and clicking EXIT.                                Figure 23  Screen shot of the data export form in IRIS. 47  Field Survey check-list  Upon completing all the tasks at the headwater stream site and before leaving the site, it is  very important that both surveyors, together, complete the field survey check-list (Fig 24) to  ensure that all tasks have in fact been completed.  It is quite easy to over-look a task,  especially if field and/or weather conditions are difficult.    Quality control and assurance  The following quality control measures will operate  •  All surveyors undertaking River Habitat Surveys will be holders of the Environment  Agency certificate for this technique.  •  All field surveyors will be trained in the techniques of RIVPACS-compliant  macroinvertebrate sampling, MTR-compliant aquatic plant surveying and chemical  sampling prior to undertaking the survey.  •  The component members of field survey teams will be regularly swapped to make  sure that teams do not diverge with time in terms of the sampling techniques that they  use.  •  Approximately 7% of all headwater sites will be audited by an experienced CEH staff  member.  All tasks will be repeated by the auditor.  •  Teams may also be accompanied while in the field by an experienced CEH staff  member to discuss progress and assess the quality of their work directly. 48  •  Headwaters field survey checklist  CS SQUARE              DATE  Surveyor A (RHS/macroinvertebrate sampling)  Surveyor B (aquatic plants)  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Is this one of the 25 squares with a new headwater sampling site?  146  161  234  269  331  366  433  494  503  535  569  572  602  626  631  644  648  699  887  910  958  998  1113  1212  1241  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The watercourse is a: Natural headwater stream  Artifical drain or ditch        This information should also have been recorded on Page 1 in RAPID    Is running water present at the site?  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Macroinvertebrate sample taken  Number of sample pots  Site map drawn (on reverse side of RIVPACS Sample Area Form)  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  River Habitat Survey completed & validated  Which RHS spot-check transect contains the invert sampling site?  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Conductivity and pH recorded  SRP.

The storage box itself should also be labelled  with a Transport Emergency (TREM) card (Fig 25).  The TREM card provides important  relevant information on the nature of the liquids contained within the box and any hazards that  may be associated with them.  It also provides information on what action to take in case of  spillage and emergency contact details.  Figure 25  Transport emergency card (TREM card) for samples in fixative carried by road.

APPLIES ONLY DURING ROAD TRANSPORT 50  All macroinvertebrate sample pots and plant specimens should be carefully catalogued and  stored at your CEH base until you have a sufficient quantity (6-8) to courier to CEH Dorset  for processing.  The samples should be sent as soon as you have enough to fill a box.  Do not  store the pots at your base for any longer than necessary; the sooner we can start processing  the samples the better.  Only 6-8 pots should sent per box.  It is sufficient to use a strong, used but undamaged  cardboard box.  Thoroughly check that all pots are tightly closed with their lids PVC taped for  extra security.  Place each pot in plastic sample bag.  Place the pots upright in the box and use  some form of packaging filler e.g. bubble wrap to ensure that the pots cannot shift around  within the box while in transit.  Attach a TREM card to the box.  The box should be sent to:  Dr. John Murphy  Centre for Ecology and Hydrology  FBA River Laboraotory  East Stoke  Wareham BH20 6BB……………………………………………………  An email should also be sent to jomu@ceh.ac.uk to inform them that samples have been sent  and detailed which samples are in the box.  The staff in Dorset will reply to your email when  the samples have safely arrived and the contents are as expected.  The plant specimens collected for confirmation of ID should be posted or couriered to CEH in  Dorset.  Ensure that all bags and tubes are clearly labelled and secure.  Depending on the  volume of material, they may be sent in an envelope or box.  Please adhere to similar  precautions and protocols as for the macroinvertebrate samples. 51  References  Environment Agency (2003) River Habitat Survey in Britain and Ireland: Field Survey  Guidance Manual 2003 version.

This will be done by mappers.  This information will be recorded on the paper  CS2007 Pond Mapping Recording Sheet and given to freshwater surveyors.  Further information on identifying ponds is included in the habitat mapping handbook in the  section headed “Further information on identification and mapping of ponds”.  In summary,  the definition of a pond used for CS2007 is “a body of standing water 25 m2 to 2 ha in area  which usually holds water for at least four months of the year”.  The area is based on the  outer pond area defined by the maximum winter water level which may be different from the  current area of water.  The definition includes all types of water bodies including temporary  ponds; ponds which are dry at the time of survey will be recorded on the CS2007 Pond  Mapping Recording Sheet and should be included as survey ponds.  Once details of all ponds are recorded on the Pond Mapping Recording Sheet, the mapper  will select the one pond (in every square that contains ponds) for condition assessment.  This  consists of a survey for macrophytes, environmental characteristics and water chemistry.   This pond is named the “survey pond”.  Once mapping of all the ponds in the square is complete and the mapper has identified the  survey pond, they will give you the Pond Mapping Recording Sheet.  It contains data on all  the ponds in the square, and it is your responsibility to return this to Pond Conservation with  the other paper forms.  Details of how to do this are at the end of this section.  Two surveyors will need to work together to carry out the pond condition assessment to  minimise Health and Safety risks associated with working with water.  Standard Health and  Safety guidelines for fieldwork with water apply.  In addition, surveyors should be aware of the  additional risks in ponds, particularly from (i) floating mats of emergent plants and floating fen  or bog which should always be avoided (ii) false bases of surface-dried mud or submerged plant  mats (iii) uneven bases – ponds often have holes, rapid changes in slope and underwater objects  which are not visible in turbid water (iv) deep silt, which can be dangerous.  A strong pole (e.g.  a pond net) should always be available as a safety aid for testing the pond base when wading in  the water, and if the surveyor is in any doubt they should not proceed.  The two surveyors should decide how to split the survey tasks between them, and one  should take responsibility for checking all fieldsheets are complete, storing fieldsheets,  plant specimens and water samples and dispatching them as agreed.  A copy of the pond condition survey fieldsheet is included at the end of this manual.    POND CONDITION ASSESSMENT METHOD 53  Steps in carrying out the pond condition survey  1. Obtain from mappers the completed “CS2000 Pond Mapping Recording Sheet”  which will identify the survey pond.  2. Write the square number, pond identification code number and GPS location on the  condition survey recording forms.  3. Take a photo of the pond with the square number written on chalkboard.  4. If there is enough water in the pond, take the water chemistry sample and meter  readings and make turbidity estimate before the water is disturbed.  The survey pond  may contain little or no water at the time of survey.  If it is completely dry, or just  contains wet mud, it will not be possible to take a water chemistry sample.    5. Carry out the environmental survey (including amenity use).  6. Carry out the macrophyte survey.  7. Check all sections of fieldsheet are complete and stapled together.  8. Dispatch water samples.  9. Gather and store all fieldsheets and plant specimens and dispatch at least monthly.    Ponds on the boundary of a square  Where a pond falls on the boundary of a square so only part of it is inside the square this will  have been included in mapping the square for the number of ponds, but only the area inside  the square will have been included in the area measured.  For the condition survey you should  survey the entire pond including the area outside the square    Filling in the fieldsheet  Complete the fieldsheet in pencil.  The identification number of the survey pond will be on  the Pond Mapping Recording Sheet.  Record any location information that will make it easier  to find the pond again for the next Countryside Survey      Taking the water chemistry sample and readings  Overview  If there is sufficient water in the pond, and before the water is disturbed, estimate the water  turbidity and take water chemistry sample and meter readings.  If there is not sufficient water  to do this record this in the box on the fieldsheet.  A single chemical sample will be taken from a typical area of the pond using the same  methods as used for headwaters.    Avoid taking samples near to inflows.  If there is an outflow present take the water sample at  this point.  The following elements will be measured at each pond site.  •  Conductivity and pH: field measurement  •  Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), total oxidisable nitrogen (TON), alkalinity:  50  ml filtered 54  Estimating turbidity  Estimate the turbidity of the water by looking down into c.30cm depth of water in the pond.   Classify the turbidity of the water into one of the following four categories: clear, moderately  clear, moderately turbid or turbid.    Take the meter readings for conductivity and pH  Enter the water and rinse the two 1 l wide-neck bottles 3 times.  Then move a few steps away  from the disturbed area and fill the bottles with undisturbed water without disturbing any  sediments.  Avoid collecting plant material.  Using the hand-held meter provided, measure the pH and conductivity (note units –  conductivity should be in µS cm-1) by placing the probes in one of the collected 1 l sample  bottle, immediately after the sample has been taken.  Both meters will need a few minutes to  stabilise and may need to be stirred as the readings settle.  Record the readings on the  fieldsheet.  Prior to measurement, ensure that the pH and conductivity probrs have been well-rinsed since  use at the previous site and are properly calibrated.    Taking the water chemistry sample for SRP, TON, alkalinity and DOC  Use the second 1L bottle of water from the pond to obtain the filtered water sample needed  for the analysis of these parameters.  Filtering will be done on site using disposable 0.45 µm  pore size syringe filters.  Use a black indelible marker to label the outside of a 50 ml (SRP/TON/Alk) plastic sample  bottle with the following information before it gets wet.   type of habitat – “POND”  type of water sample - “SRP/TON/Alk”  kilometre square number  date as day-month-year (e.g. 07-08-06).    Wash the syringe by twice filling the syringe chamber with some of the water sample and  emptying it on to the ground.  Then fill the syringe chamber again with sample water and  attach a new disposable filter cartridge.  Then empty the water in the chamber, through the  filter, into the 50 ml plastic sample bottle.  Rinse the sample bottles out with this water.  Do  not exert excessive pressure as this might rupture the filter.  Fill the syringe chamber once more with some of the water sample, re-attach the same filter  cartridge and fill the 50 ml plastic sample bottle.  Screw on the lid tightly and place in the  appropriate (pre-addressed and postage-paid) padded envelope.  If the filter cartridge becomes blocked during filtration then change and continue with more  of unfiltered water sample.  After filtering, check the filtered sample for suspended material  e.g. from a ruptured filter paper.  If suspended material is present then discard the filtered  sample and start again.  Tick the boxes on the fieldsheet to confirm the samples have been taken. 55  Carrying out the environmental survey (including amenity use)  Overview  In summary the procedure is as follows:  o Take a photo of the pond  o Identify the outer boundary of the pond  o Walk the pond perimeter, noting relevant features on the fieldsheet as you go (e.g.  presence of inflows, surrounding landuse and waterbodies etc.)  o Draw a sketch of the pond outline and estimate pond size  o Fill in the rest of the fieldsheet.  Filling in some sections will require you to enter the  pond and so disturb the sediment: make sure water quality survey has been carried  out before you do this.    Photographing the pond  Take a photograph of the pond showing the square number written on the chalkboard.   Include the whole area of the pond if possible and any visible features which will help  identification of the same site in future.  Tick the box on the fieldsheet to confirm a photo has  been taken.    Identifying the outer boundary of the pond  The outer edge of the pond is defined as the 'upper level at which water stands in winter'. It  will usually be dry at the time of the survey.  The outer boundary can be identified from one  or more characteristics.  It is often identified by a change in the distribution of wetland  plants, particularly by a rapid transition to terrestrial species, often marked by a fringe of soft  rush.  Where solid features such as trees, walls or pipes occur within the water area a “water  mark” will usually be evident.  In some cases where willow trees are present a thick bundles  of fine roots out of the water can indicate the depth to which the roots have been submerged.   In some cases a break of slope will be present at the winter waterline. In ponds with outflows,  the level of the outflow will usually determine the upper winter water level.    Sketch the outline of the pond  Sketch the outline of the outer pond boundary.  This will help you estimate the pond area and  help confirm the identity of the pond in future surveys.  Note on the sketch any obvious  nearby features which will help identify the pond again e.g. wall / hedge / inflow.  Draw an appropriate scale bar (e.g. 10 m long) and indicate north.    Estimating the area of the pond  In order to estimate the area of the pond you need to know the length of your standard pace  and have practiced and checked your accuracy in pacing distances.  Pace the length and width  of the outer area of the pond (maximum winter water level).  Calculate the area by treating  the pond as a simple shape such as a circle or rectangle (or a number of joined shapes) and  adjusting the result to account for the difference between the actual pond shape and the shape  used for calculation.  For example if the pond is an oval approximately 10 metres long and 5  meters wide you could treat it as a rectangle of 50 m2, then decide to record an area of 45 m2  to account for its oval shape. 56  Remember the pond definition to be used for CS2007 is “a body of standing water from 25m2  (e.g. 5 m  x 5 m) to 2 ha (e.g. 200 m x 100 m) in area which usually holds water for four  months of the year or more”.    Measuring the drawdown height  The drawdown height is the vertical distance between the height of the maximum winter  water level and the actual water level at the time of survey.  It is not the horizontal distance or  the distance along the ground.  Measure this height using the distance markings on the handle of your pond net.  This is  easiest at a steep edge of the pond.      Estimating the proportion of water present in the pond.  Estimate the proportion of the area of water present in the pond at the time of survey relative  to the area covered when the pond is full to the maximum water level.  It may help to draw  the actual water level on your sketch.  The figures below show 75%, 50% and 25% of the  area of the pond covered with water.      Measuring sediment and water depths  Check that the water quality survey has been carried out before you enter the pond and  disturb the sediment.  Water depth and sediment depth are measured using the length markings on the handle of  your pond net.  To measure water depth put the pole into the water (net end upwards) and  note the depth at which the pole touches the top of the sediment. In most ponds you will feel  resistance from the sediment at this point, but where the sediment is very fine, you will need  to do this by eye.  You may see bubbles of gas released as the sediment is disturbed.  To  measure the total depth of sediment plus water push the pole down further until you reach the  solid base of the pond.  If it is possible to walk safely to the middle of the pond then measure sediment and water  depth at the five positions shown in the diagram below.  Transect A is the longest dimension  of the pond.  Take readings at ¼, ½ and ¾ along it.  Transect B is perpendicular to this.  Take  readings at ¼ and ¾ of the distance across transect B.  If it is not possible to take some of the  readings then put a cross through the relevant boxes.    Current water level Maximum winter water level  Drawdown height  75%  50%   25%  Maximum  water  level 57  Transect  A  Transect  B  Maximum  water level     Estimating composition of sediment and pond base  Most ponds have a layer of sediment consisting of soft or hard substances such as organic  debris, silt, sand.  This sits on top of the pond base which is usually a natural material (e.g.  gravel, clay, rock, peat) and occasionally may be man-made (e.g. puddled clay or artificial  liner). Note that puddled clay pond bases are quite rare: most ponds with clay bases are  located on naturally occurring clay geology.  Examine the sediment and pond base to work out its composition.  Wearing long sleeved  gloves take a small handful of sediment and feel the base material at various positions around  the pond, both in and out of the water.  Use the net pole to feel in deeper water to feel the  extent of soft and hard material.  Estimate the proportion of the total area of the sediment that is made up of each of the  following: (i) organic debris, leaves and twigs, (ii) ooze (non-particulate) and fine silts, (iii)  gravel / sand (often stream-borne), or others (specify what they are).  For each of these write  a 1 on the fieldsheet if that element makes up 0% to 32% of the total, 2 for 33% to 66% and 3  for 67% to 100%.  For the pond base record using the same system of categories the proportion of the pond base  area which consists of each of the following: (i) clay or silt, (ii) gravel, sand or cobbles, (iii)  rock, (iv) peat, or (v) others (specify).    Estimating the extent of pollution in the pond  Examine the pond for dumped rubbish and rubble.  If there is none or a negligible amount  (e.g. a few chewing gum wrappers, less than 1% of a small pond affected) tick the box,  otherwise estimate the area covered.  Assess visually whether there is potential for road run-off to enter the pond.  If there is then  score the likely impact on a scale from 1 (minimal input) to 5 (major input e.g. drain direct  from major road into small pond).  Take into account factors such as the proximity of the  road, whether it drains a large area of road as, for example, when the pond takes road run-off  from a hill, the probable route taken by water draining from the road and the size of the pond.    List any other physical evidence of pollution such as oil or presence of field drains.    Describing inflows and outflows  Identify any inflows into or outflows from the pond, even if they are dry at the time of  survey.  Note the number of dry inflows and outflows.  For each wet inflow and outflow  record the average water width and depth.  Measure the rate of flow in terms of the time in  seconds it takes for the water to travel one metre.  This is most easily done by stirring up the  sediment and timing how long it takes to travel a measured distance.  If you cannot tell  whether the water in the inflow or outflow is moving mark a cross in the box. 58    Recording pond management  Tick the appropriate boxes if there is any evidence of the following pond management having  been carried out.  Ignore any management which has obviously been carried out over 10 years  ago or is at such a distance that it is unlikely to impact the pond.  The options to record are as  follows:  •  the pond has been fully dredged  •  the pond has been partly dredged  •  more than 5% of the pond vegetation has been removed  •  some, but less than 5%, of the pond vegetation has been removed  •  trees have been planted  •  trees have been felled   •  trees have been partly cut back  •  the pond has been changed in its shape or size  •  plants have been introduced (e.g. obvious species that should not be in this  geographic locations, baskets etc)  •  plants on the pond bank have been mown  •  straw has been added to the pond  •  structural work has been carried out (e.g. to dam the pond).    Evidence of livestock grazing  This section refers to evidence of grazing by livestock defined as cows, sheep and horses, not  grazing by wild animals (e.g. rabbits or deer).  If there is evidence that the pond is grazed by  livestock (e.g. ground is poached) tick the box on the fieldsheet and record the percentage of  the pond perimeter that is grazed.  This will usually be all of the perimeter unless access is  restricted in some parts e.g. by fencing, trees or if an area is too steep.  If there is evidence of  grazing then estimate grazing intensity from 1 (infrequent or low intensity) to 5 (pond  margins heavily poached and almost bare).  If possible list the types of grazing livestock.    Evidence of use by water birds  This section refers to use, and over-use, by water birds such as ducks, geese, coots, moorhens  and swans.  If there is evidence that the pond is used by these birds (either the birds  themselves or signs such as trampling, feathers, faeces, food left by humans) then tick the  box on the fieldsheet.  Then estimate the intensity of their impact from 1 (little evidence of  impact) to 5 (little vegetation, “duck pond”).  Record any other information e.g. species,  evidence of nesting.    Evidence of fish  Record a 1 on the fieldsheet if fish are known to be present i.e. if you or your colleagues have  seen fish in the pond during the survey or if a someone who knows the pond has seen fish in  it this year.  Record 2 if there is evidence that fish are likely to be present (e.g. fishing pegs, 59  turbid water).  Record 3 if there is no evidence that fish are present.  If possible record any  further information such as species or estimates of abundance.    Evidence of amphibians  Tick the box if you see any amphibians.  If possible record any further information on  species, life stage and approximate number.    Recording surrounding land use  Estimate the percentage of surrounding land use or land cover in each of the following  categories in two distance zones from the perimeter of the pond: (i) 0 to 5 m, and (ii) 0 to  100m (see figure below).  This can include land outside the kilometre square.      Category  Examples  Trees & woodland  Deciduous and coniferous woodland, individual trees, scrub, hedgerow  Heathland & moorland  Dwarf shrub heath, sub-arctic mountain  Unimproved grassland  Herb-rich, calcareous, acid and moorland grassland (plant quality  indicators usually present)  Rank vegetation   Unmanaged grass, neglected & abandoned land, set-aside, verges, golf  course roughs, buffer strips  Improved grassland  Fertile agricultural grass, mown grass, golf course greens (plant quality  indicators absent)  Arable  All crops, includes flower and fruit crops (e.g. strawberries) and  ploughed land  Urban buildings & gardens Areas in curtilage, includes glass-houses, farm yards  Roads, tracks, paths  Including car-parks and footpaths  0 to 100m from  maximum winter  water level of pond  0 to 5m from  maximum winter  water level of pond 60  Rock, stone, gravel  Cliffs, rock-outcrops, gravel-pits, quarries, areas of sand, gravel or stone  Bog, fen, marsh, flush  Wetland vegetation, blanket bog  Ponds & lakes  Permanent and seasonal waterbodies  Streams & ditches  River, stream, ditch, spring  Other (state)   Where the land use does not fit into any of the above categories e.g.  maritime vegetation, saltmarsh, sand-dune, orchard, bracken, canal,  railway    Amenity value: view of pond  Are there any public rights of way near the pond from which it could be visible?  Score each  on a scale from 1 (pond totally obscured) to 5 (significant part of the pond clearly visible).   Score separately for ‘A’ roads, ‘B’ roads, minor roads, footpaths, bridle paths, or other (state  what they are).   If there is more than one of any type of right of way record the highest score.    Amenity value: public access to pond  Record whether or not the pond is in area of open public access  (e.g. Common, village  green) i.e. could a member of the public access the pond without needing permission?  A  public footpath passing alongside a pond does not count as it being in an area of open public  access.    Amenity value: evidence of amenity use  Tick the appropriate boxes if there is evidence of any of the following amenity uses:  •  Fishing (fishing platforms, pegs, swims, embayments)  •  Ornamental fish (e.g. goldfish, Koy carp)  •  Ornamental/pinioned wildfowl (nesting boxes, feeders, platforms)  •  Pond dipping and other wildlife interests (dipping platforms, bird hides)  •  Shooting (hides, blinds)  •  Boating and other water sports (boat, boathouse)  •  Golf hazard  •  Other (please state). 61  Macrophyte survey method    Overview  The aims of the macrophyte survey are to:    •  record all species of wetland plant present within the outer boundary of the pond, and  estimate their abundance.  •  estimate the total plant cover in terms of submerged, floating-leaved and emergent  species, and  •  record the amount of shade from overhanging trees and woody plants.    Carrying out the macrophyte survey  Make sure you are aware of the position of the outer boundary of the pond.  The aim is to  record all species of macrophyte within this area.    The recording sheet gives a list of all plant species to be considered as wetland plants for this  survey.  Nomenclature follows The New Atlas of the British and Irish Flora (2002).  Taxa  such as hybrids, sub-species, exotics and cultivars have been omitted to save space.  If they  are identified they should be noted in the space provided.  Terrestrial plants and wetland  plants growing outside the pond boundary should not be recorded.    Rare species (IUCN Red List status or recorded in less than 100 10 x 10 km squares in  Britain) have been marked with an asterisk.  If any of these are found confirmation is needed.  Guidance for this is given in the section “Rare species confirmation” below.    Plants should be surveyed by walking and wading all safely accessible areas within the outer  boundary of the pond.  Deeper water areas should be surveyed by regularly throwing a  grapnel to collect submerged plants.  In larger waterbodies look for plants blown from deeper  water and deposited on the strand-line.  In ponds with inorganic substrates (e.g. new ponds,  ponds with a sand or gravel base) check the very shallow areas for stoneworts and fine-leaved  pondweeds.  Stoneworts, in particular, are often under recorded. Better quality ponds often  support more than one species of stonewort so if stonewort plants are found, look around for  other plants with a different morphology or colour.    Note on the fieldsheet any areas of the pond you are unable to access to survey.    Plant identification  Most wetland plants can be identified in the field using a hand lens. All plants should be  identified to species level wherever possible, except for Populus and Salix, which can be  recorded as sp.      If you are not sure of an identification collect a sample in a sealed, labelled plastic bag  to examine later using your identification keys.  A list of identification keys for wetland  plants is given in the box below.    If you are unable to identify a species you can send a specimen for identification.  This will  be likely for many Callitriche, Potamogeton, Ranunculus and charophyte species. See table  below for guidance. 62  Recommendations for plants to routinely send off for identification  Group  Recommended routine  collection  Method Comments  Callitriche  All species but only if  fruits present.  Pressed  This group has always caused significant  confusion and even the translucent-leaved  species have sometimes been mis-recorded due  to the spread of C.truncata. Vegetative material  can only rarely be identified reliably and usually  needs to be recorded as Callitriche sp..  Potamogeton  All species except  P.natans, P.polygonifolius,  P. crispus.   Pressed  Fine-leaved species are critical and are  frequently confused. Broad-leaved species are  easier but are complicated by some frequent  hybrids.   Ranunculus  (Sect.  Batrachium)    All species if aquatic and  with flowers and fruits  except R. hederaceus,  R.omiophyllus and  R.circinatus.  Pressed  A difficult group and complicated by  hybridisation. Most species with capillary leaves  cannot be identified without flowers and fruits or  when growing terrestrially. These should be  recorded as R.aquatilis agg.  Utricularia    Routine collection of  U.minor is not necessary  while the segregates of  U.vulgaris agg. cannot be  separated vegetatively.  Pickled  Separating into the three main groups is not  difficult. In the U.vulgaris agg., U.australis and  U.vulgaris cannot satisfactorily be separated  vegetatively. Flowering material is fairly easy to  separate but the flowers are best preserved  pickled. The segregates of U.intermedia agg.  (which very rarely flower in the UK) can be  separated vegetatively from the internal hairs on  the bladders. These must be pickled, not pressed.   Stoneworts  (Charophytes)    All species  Pressed or  pickled  An important group, because a high proportion  of species are uncommon. Some species require  microscopic confirmation.   Hybrids  All hybrids of aquatic  species and uncommon  hybrids of emergent taxa.  Pressed    Other problem areas  Myriophyllum    Consider keeping samples  if the site is in an area  where the species is  uncommon (e.g the  Highlands and upland  areas for M.spicatum, most  of England for  M.alterniflorum, most  areas outside the Fens and  Norfolk Broads for  M.verticillatum).  Pressed  Some confusion has arisen between M.spicatum,  M.verticillatum and M.alterniflorum due to lack  of clarity of characters in some identification  texts, particularly in the past.     Sparganium  Consider keeping samples  of S.natans from upland or  acidic lake situations.  Pressed  Again there have been confusions, particularly in  the past, between S.angustifolium and S.natans.  This has resulted in some over-recording of the  latter.   Modified from: Stewart (2004). Recommendations for the collection and preservation of specimens during macrophyte surveys.    Rare species confirmation  Species that are (or suspected to be) rare need to be confirmed. Note that rare and legally  protected plants are indicated on the plant fieldsheet with an asterisk. 63  The process of confirming rare plants needs to be undertaken with care because (i) there  should be a general presumption against damaging plants, particulalry of uncommon species,  (ii) a licence is needed to remove Wildlife and Countryside Act Schedule 8 species.    In practice, however, pieces of plants will need to be "picked" in order to examine them out  of the water for identification. These bits can then be re-used to provide voucher specimens  for confirmation. However, care should always be taken to minimise damage to potentially  rare species, particularly where populations are small.     Where there are concerns about damage, then a digital photograph can be used for  confirmation if this is likely to be sufficient for identification  (e.g. flowering or fruiting  Baldellia growing on muddy shores). For very rare species (i.e. RDB or Scheduled species),  where there are no other appropriate means of confirmation, a message should be left, as  soon as possible, for the Pond Conservation project team (see contact details at the end of the  pond section) who will visit the site. 64    List of identification keys for wetland plants (non-exhaustive)  General  Blamey, M., Fitter, R. and Fitter, A.

Sending specimens for identification  To send a specimen for identification take a small amount of the plant (e.g. 15 cm minimum),  if possible including any features likely to help identification e.g. flowers / fruit / branched  stems / underwater and surface leaves.    Write a label in pencil on waterproof paper.  Include the square number and pond  identification number, your name and the date and make sure the information on the label is  transferred with the specimen as it is pressed or preserved.    Place the wet plant in a sealable plastic bag and press or preserve within a few hours.    To press most plants (e.g. Callitriche species): place on a piece of A4 clean white paper and  put this between two more sheets.  Put this between c.10 sheets of newspaper and store with a  weight on top e.g. under a heavy book.  Change the surrounding paper as necessary to ensure  the plant is completely dry and so does not rot. 65  To press plants with finely divided floating leaves (e.g. Ranunculus, Potamogeton species):  float the plant in clean water in a small shallow tray.  Place a piece of thin white card under  the plant and lift out of the water gently so the structure of the plant can be seen –  then treat  as described above.    When the pressed plants are dry store in the plastic wallets in the box file provided.    To preserve in alcohol (‘pickle’), (e.g. Charophytes): put a specimen of the plant into a 25ml  Sterilin tube and fill with 80% alcohol (provided for preservation of the invertebrate sample).    Return pressed and preserved plant specimens to Pond Conservation.     Filling in the fieldsheet  Record the plants found by drawing a line in pencil through their names on the fieldsheet.  Estimate abundance for each species in terms of the area of the pond it covers using the  following scale and note this next to the species name e.g. Agrostis stolonifera F.  D  Dominant  91 – 100% cover  A  Abundant  51 – 90% cover  F  Frequent  21 – 50% cover  O  Occasional  6 – 20% cover  R  Rare  0 – 5% cover    Record in the boxes provided the total percentage of the area of the pond covered by:  •  submerged plant species (species in the submerged plant list)  •  floating-leaved plant species (species in the floating-leaved plant list)  •  emergent plant species (species in the emergent plant list)  •  tree overhang (imagine looking down on the pond from above, assess the proportion  of the area of the pond that is directly overhung by woody vegetation).    Completing the survey  Checking survey data is complete  Check all relevant boxes on the fieldsheet have been filled in and that separated field sheets  (i.e. pond mapping recording sheet, environmental survey, macrophyte survey and water  quality fieldsheets) have been stapled together.  Tick the box on the fieldsheet to confirm this has been done.    Returning samples and fieldsheets for analysis  One member of each survey team will be responsible for overseeing storage of water samples,  plant specimens and fieldsheets.  When convenient (aim for at least once per month)  fieldsheets should be photocopied and posted with plant specimens to Pond Conservation.   Photos can be copied onto CD and posted with fieldsheets or emailed with square and pond  numbers so long as emails do not exceed 20Mb each.

These  data were acquired and calibrated as part of the South West TELLUS Project by the  British Antarctic Survey (BAS).    The Environment Agency was requested to assist in the final processing of these  data to produce both a Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Terrain Model  (DTM). The DSM is a raster dataset that contains the ground surface and all objects  above it, the DTM is a raster dataset that contains only the ground surface.    The requirement was for automated processing without intensive manual interaction.   This, combined with the operating parameters used during collection and calibration,  had the potential to affect the overall height accuracy.  Comparisons were therefore  made against ground truth surveys to enable comment to be made on data quality.    This report describes the basic processing carried out and the quality achieved.        2.0  Data Processing      Geomatics used automated procedures to produce DSM and DTM layers from the  BAS calibrated point cloud. The LAS data were processed through Terrascan in 1km  x 1km blocks using the standard 1m resolution classification macros. These macros  classify the point cloud into ground points and surface objects.  A secondary DTM  that retains ground points on steep slopes was also produced to be used at a later  point for definition of coastal cliffs.  Data were than taken into ArcView using modified versions of standard Environment  Agency scripts and a newly developed routine to mosaic overlapping 4x4km blocks.   A 50m overlap was applied between adjacent blocks.  An automated routine was used to fill no data gaps in the DTM above a determined  size threshold.  No additional breaklines were used, which means that the auto-filling  may result in triangulation effects in some locations.  For standard Environment Agency LIDAR products, extensive manual editing is  carried out on the automated DTM.  For this project, no manual editing was applied  so the results were as produced by the Terrascan macros.  This may result in some  large buildings and bridges being left in, some tree stands having not been taken out  and some cliffs being taken out that should have been left in.   Also, as the LIDAR data were captured during the summer with leaf-on conditions, it  is not possible to see locations where the laser pulses have not penetrated the  vegetation.  This may result in false ground levels. PM_1478 LIDAR Quality Control Report               Automatic cliff-retrieval from the secondary DTM was then carried out by merging  back into the DTM cliffs within 100m of the Ordnance Survey mean sea level line,  where there was a difference of 50cm between the DTM and secondary DTM.  The overlapping 4x4km blocks (both DTM and DSM) where then clipped and merged  (using smooth feathering) into regular 5x5km blocks, and exported in ESRI Binary  GRID, ESRI ASCII Grid and geo-referenced JPEG format, named after their OS grid  reference.  Data were imported into an ArcGIS GeoDatabase and mosaiced into one seamless  DTM and DSM, with hill-shading applied.    3.0  Ground Control    Geomatics have compared the DSM and DTM layers to existing LIDAR and data  from 74 random GPS ground truth sites.     Appendix A includes a plot of the data showing coverage with locations of  independent ground truth sites.      Appendix B shows the comparison of the LIDAR and Ground Truth surveys.

We have also resupplied the Point Cloud LAS data.    ASCII Grid: The ASCII raster file format is a simple format that can be used to  transfer raster data between various applications.  It is basically a few lines of header  data followed by a grid of cell Z values. The header data includes the following  keywords and values:    ncols       - number of columns in the data set.  nrows       - number of rows in the data set.  xllcenter or xllcorner  - x-co-ordinate of the centre or lower-left corner of the    lower-left cell.  yllcenter or yllcorner  - y-co-ordinate of the centre or lower-left corner of the    lower-left cell.  cellsize      - cell size for the data set in m.  nodata_value  - value in the file assigned to cells whose value is  unknown.   This keyword and value is optional. The  nodata_value  defaults to -9999.    For example:    ncols 480  nrows 450  xllcorner 378923  yllcorner 4072345  cellsize 1  nodata_value -9999  43 3 45 7 3 56 2 5 23 65 34 6 32 etc  35 45 65 34 2 6 78 4 38 44 89 3 2 7 etc  etc      ESRI Binary Grid: The ESRI Binary file format is an ESRI proprietary format that  contains the same cell values as the ASCII grid but these are stored in a binary  format designed to load quickly in ESRI ArcGIS software.    Point Cloud LAS: The LAS point cloud containing all LIDAR returns and their  attributes. Each point is assigned a classification code based on whether it is a  ground point or a surface object. Surface objects are put into different classes based  on the vertical distance to the nearest ground point. PM_1478 LIDAR Quality Control Report                 5.0  Data Quality    The comparison against the ground truth surveys showed the accuracy of the data to  be within 10cm which is considered of high quality.  This indicates that although the  data were acquired in large blocks and to long baselines this has not impacted  greatly on the accuracy achieved.  This height comparison is well within the stated  accuracy of +/-25cm of the project specification.  These comparisons are made in areas of no vegetation with limited slope and  surface artefacts and so will not be indicative of the absolute height throughout the  survey area.    The main quality factors to consider are:  The presence of vegetation in the data will mean that a false surface may have been  derived in areas where the LIDAR pulse does not penetrate the vegetation canopy.  The automated routines may leave artefacts in the filtered product (the DTM) such as  large buildings and bridges and may remove features that would have been retained  with a more intensive filtering process.

Brief description of the data A collection of six morphometric trait measurements (forewing length, body length, thorax length, thorax width, abdomen length, and abdomen width) relating to the 177 macro-moth species sampled by two Rothamsted Insect Survey (RIS) light traps: Bentley Wood and Porton Down III, from 33 dates across 2017 (11-14 & 31 May; 1, 14-21 & 25-27 June; and 1-11, 17-18, and 24-26 July).  Since the RIS light-trap network does not collect and store physical samples, our morphometric trait database was primarily constructed using images of these 177 macro-moth species, namely digitised specimens from the collection of the Natural History Museum, London (NHM). Measurements were taken from five randomly selected digitised specimens per species using ImageJ software (Schneider et al. 2012). Where significant sexual dimorphism was present within a species, five specimens were randomly selected per sex per species. For macro-moth species without records digitised by the NHM, measurements were taken from the (to-scale) photographic colour plates within Skinner, B. 2009. Colour Identification Guide to Moths of the British Isles. 3rd ed. Stenstrup, Denmark: Apollo Books, using Duratool digital callipers (resolution: 0.1mm; accuracy: ±0.2mm). All authors were responsible for the collection and collation of these morphometric trait data.  These data relate to macro-moth species only. Micro-moth species were not well-represented in the light trap data provided to us by the RIS, and many of those species that were present did not have records digitised by the NHM. We therefore decided to concentrate our analysis on macro-moth species only. Three species aggregates were originally present in the species counts within the RIS light trap data (in addition to the 177 named species): Eupithecia species, Oligia species, and “unidentified macro spp”. These three aggregates are not included in this dataset.  These morphometric trait data were collected as part of a NERC standard grant (NE/S001298/1) aiming to use dual-polarization weather radar to map standing insect activity and biomass across wide spatial and temporal scales within the UK. With these data we were aiming to link ground-level nocturnal insect morphometric diversity to the diversity of nocturnal biological signals (bioscatterers) present on weather radar scans. Collection methods Our primary data consists of records relating to the 177 macro-moth species sampled by two Rothamsted Insect Survey (RIS) light traps, located at Bentley Wood (Lat: 51.09030151, Long: -1.640147448) and Porton Down (Lat: 51.14438248, Long: -1.682601929) (listed as Bentley Wood and Porton Down III by the RIS) from 33 dates across 2017 (11-14 & 31 May; 1, 14-21 & 25-27 June; and 1-11, 17-18, and 24-26 July). These data relate to macro-moth species only. Micro-moth species were not well-represented in the light trap data provided to us by the RIS, and many of those species that were present did not have records digitised by the NHM. We therefore decided to concentrate our analysis on macro-moth species only. Since the RIS light-trap network does not collect and store physical samples, our morphometric trait database was primarily constructed using images of these 177 macro-moth species, namely digitised specimens from the collection of the Natural History Museum, London (NHM) (Natural History Museum, 2014), and the (to-scale) colour plates from Colour Identification Guide to Moths of the British Isles (Skinner, 2009). We chose to measure six morphometric traits: forewing length, body length, thorax length, abdomen length, thorax width, and abdomen width; all of which were measured in millimetres. These traits were chosen to best characterise the overall size and shape of a moth’s body and were based upon the traits used to estimate Lepidopteran body mass in García-Barros (2015). For each macro-moth species within our primary dataset that had specimens with images digitised by the NHM, we randomly selected five specimens for measurement. Where a species displayed sexual dimorphism that resulted in significant differences in overall body size and/or shape between sexes, we randomly selected five specimens per sex. Sexual dimorphism was identified via a range of sources, including Skinner (2009) and UKMoths (ukmoths.org.uk). Trait measurements were taken using ImageJ software (Schneider et al. 2012). All digitised images from the NHM include a scale bar that allowed us to calibrate our measurements using ImageJ. Specimens with missing or damaged body parts, or where the body or wings of the specimen were deformed in some way, were not measured (another specimen was chosen at random).  Where a species within our primary data had no specimens with images digitised by the NHM, we took measurements from the (to-scale) colour plates present in Skinner, 2009). Again, five images were randomly selected per species for measurement, except where significant sexual dimorphism was present within a species, in which case five individuals per sex were randomly selected. Skinner (2009) often included fewer than five images per species (or per sex per species) and therefore, in many cases, we simply measured as many images per species as we could, inclusive of both sexes. Measurements from Skinner (2009) were made with Duratool digital callipers (resolution: 0.1mm; accuracy ±0.2mm). Four macro-moth species displayed species dimorphism but had no identifying information regarding the sex of the randomly selected specimens within the NHM digitised collection. For these four species (Alcis repandata, Hepialus lupulinus, Lymantria monacha, and Photedes minima), additional measurements were taken from Skinner (2009) for five male and five female specimens (or as many specimens per sex per species as were present). Three species aggregates were originally present in the species counts within the RIS light trap data (in addition to the 177 named species): Eupithecia species, Oligia species, and “unidentified macro spp”. These three aggregates are not included in this dataset.  In addition to the six morphometric traits, the sex of each specimen measured was recorded (if known), as well as a unique identifier for the image (a permanent URL for each digitised NHM record, or the plate and specimen number for records taken from Skinner, 2009). Due to human error, fifteen records do not have a unique identifier associated with them. These records are identified by an NA in the “Source_ID” column of the data set. Laboratory instrumentation ImageJ software (Schneider et al., 2012).  Digital callipers (Duratool: resolution: 0.1mm, accuracy ±0.2mm)  Calibration step All digitised specimen images from the NHM contain a scale bar that allowed us to calibrate our measurements using ImageJ. Nature and units of recorded values Forewing length: measured from the base of the wing (where it joins the thorax) to the apex of the wing. Body length: measured from the anterior margin of the patagium to the posterior margin of the final abdominal segment; where possible, this measurement did not include hair fringes or the genitals of the specimen (if visible). We chose not include the head in this measurement as it was often angled downward or hidden by the thorax in many of our specimens.  Thorax length: measured from the anterior margin of the patagium to the posterior margin of the metathorax; where possible, this measurement did not include hair fringes. Abdomen length: measured from the anterior margin of the metathorax to the anterior margin of the final abdominal segment; where possible, this measurement did not include hair fringes or the genitals of the specimen (if visible). Thorax width: measured laterally across the widest portion of the thorax; where possible, this measurement did not include hair fringes. Abdomen width: measured laterally across the mid-portion of the abdomen; where possible, this measurement did not include hair fringes. All morphometric traits were measured in millimetres. Details of data structure This dataset comprises a single csv file labelled RIS2017_macromoth_morphometric_data.csv.
