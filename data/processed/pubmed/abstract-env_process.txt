Although several empirical studies and systematic reviews have documented the mental health impacts of global climate change, the range of impacts has not been well understood. This review examines mental health impacts of three types of climate-related events: (1) acute events such as hurricanes, floods, and wildfires; (2) subacute or long-term changes such as drought and heat stress; and (3) the existential threat of long-lasting changes, including higher temperatures, rising sea levels and a permanently altered and potentially uninhabitable physical environment. The impacts represent both direct (i.e. heat stress) and indirect (i.e. economic loss, threats to health and well-being, displacement and forced migration, collective violence and civil conflict, and alienation from a degraded environment) consequences of global climate change.

Natural disasters may lead to infectious disease outbreaks when they result in substantial population displacement and exacerbate synergic risk factors (change in the environment, in human conditions and in the vulnerability to existing pathogens) for disease transmission. We reviewed risk factors and potential infectious diseases resulting from prolonged secondary effects of major natural disasters that occurred from 2000 to 2011. Natural disasters including floods, tsunamis, earthquakes, tropical cyclones (e.g., hurricanes and typhoons) and tornadoes have been secondarily described with the following infectious diseases including diarrheal diseases, acute respiratory infections, malaria, leptospirosis, measles, dengue fever, viral hepatitis, typhoid fever, meningitis, as well as tetanus and cutaneous mucormycosis. Risk assessment is essential in post-disaster situations and the rapid implementation of control measures through re-establishment and improvement of primary healthcare delivery should be given high priority, especially in the absence of pre-disaster surveillance data.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Climate change is the biggest public health threat of the twenty-first century but its impact on the perinatal period has only recently received attention. This review summarizes recent literature regarding the impacts of climate change and related environmental disasters on pregnancy health and provides recommendations to inform future adaptation and mitigation efforts. RECENT FINDINGS: Accumulating evidence suggests that the changing climate affects pregnancy health directly via discrete environmental disasters (i.e., wildfire, extreme heat, hurricane, flood, and drought), and indirectly through changes in the natural and social environment. Although studies vary greatly in design, analytic methods, and assessment strategies, they generally converge to suggest that climate-related disasters are associated with increased risk of gestational complication, pregnancy loss, restricted fetal growth, low birthweight, preterm birth, and selected delivery/newborn complications. Window(s) of exposure with the highest sensitivity are not clear, but both acute and chronic exposures appear important. Furthermore, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations may be more vulnerable. Policy, clinical, and research strategies for adaptation and mitigation should be continued, strengthened, and expanded with cross-disciplinary efforts. Top priorities should include (a) reinforcing and expanding policies to further reduce emission, (b) increasing awareness and education resources for healthcare providers and the public, (c) facilitating access to quality population-based data in low-resource areas, and (d) research efforts to better understand mechanisms of effects, identify susceptible populations and windows of exposure, explore interactive impacts of multiple exposures, and develop novel methods to better quantify pregnancy health impacts.

To understand the influence of climate change on heavy rainfalls and reduce the consequential multidimensional risks, we develop a climate-informed and adaptation strategies-related framework by using the information on heavy rainfalls and various socioeconomic factors. For this purpose, we firstly quantify the spatiotemporal characteristics of heavy rainfalls with various durations (1 h to multiple days) and return periods (2-year to 50-year) for the flood-prone country Cambodia, as a case study, during the historical period (1980-2005), mid-century (2040-2065), and late-century (2070-2095), using the latest three hourly climate model datasets under RCP 8.5 and 1 hourly ERA5 reanalysis datasets. A novel conditional artificial neural network (CANN) model is employed for temporal disaggregation to obtain the monthly maximum of 1 hourly rainfall in the future periods and subsequently, a zero-inflated generalized extreme value function (ZIGEV) is applied for extreme value analysis (EVA) to obtain rainfall intensity with different return periods. Secondly, the province-level flood risk change maps are developed based on a novel flood risk change index. The combination of CANN and ZIGEV performs better in EVA than traditional approaches by reducing the uncertainty from the stationarity assumption of temporal disaggregation and bias in the disaggregated rainfall. Rainfall intensity is projected to increase more in higher return periods and shorter durations towards the late-century, predominantly over Southern and Central Cambodia. Projected rainfall intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves in the capital city, Phnom Penh, reveal that the occurrence frequency of heavy rainfall in a given duration (e.g., 48 h) is likely to become ~10-fold in the mid-century. Results of province-level flood risk change maps indicate that Southeastern and Northwestern regions should be prioritized for employing adaption strategies. Our results will assist the policymakers in further mapping the flood susceptibility and vulnerability in different spatiotemporal scales across various communities and localities in the country and beyond.

Human-induced climate change has increased the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation1. Due to the complexity of runoff generation and the streamflow process, the historical impact of human-induced climate change on river flooding remains uncertain. Here, we address the question of whether anthropogenic climate change has altered the probability of the extreme river flood events for the period 1951-2010 based on simulated river discharge derived from large ensemble climate experiments with and without human-induced climate change. The results indicate that human-induced climate change altered the probabilities of 20 of the 52 analyzed flood events. Fourteen of these 20 flood events, which occurred mainly in Asia and South America, were very likely to have been enhanced by human-induced climate change due to an increase in heavy precipitation. Conversely, two flood events in North/South America and two flood events in Asia and two flood events in Europe were suppressed by human-induced climate change, perhaps as a result of lower snowfall. Human-induced climate change has enhanced flooding more prominently in recent years, providing important insights into potential adaptation strategies for river flooding.

Drought is an extreme climatic event that mostly occurs as a result of low rainfall, which leads to lack of water in various agro-ecological conditions of Pakistan. The condition could be further exacerbated by the prevailing dry weather. Therefore, accurate, timely, and efficient drought monitoring is crucial to ensure that its adverse effects are mitigated. In this study, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and TRMM-based data were used together with remote sensing techniques to improve drought mitigation and disaster risk reduction strategies. In order to monitor drought mitigation and disaster risk reduction strategies in Pakistan, the crop water stress index (CWSI), vegetation condition index (VCI), normalized vegetation supply water index (NVSWI), vegetation health index (VHI), and temperature vegetation drought index (TVDI) were chosen as the instrument. Due to low rainfall and significantly low vegetation, CWSI, NDVI, TVDI, and VHI are useful in characterizing drought mitigation strategies in Pakistan. Monthly NDVI, NAP, NVSWI, TVDI, VCI, and VHI values and heat map analysis show that Pakistan suffered from drought in years 2001, 2002, and 2006. Seasonal CWSI, NDVI, VHI, and TVDI confirmed that Pakistan was affected by severe drought in 2001, which continued and led to severe drought in 2002 and 2006. We generate spatial correlation coefficients between NDVI and NVSWI, VCI, and VHI, and NVSWI and VCI and VHI, while the VCI and VHI values are significantly positively correlated. CWSI, NDVI, VHI, and TVDI show positive signs of effective climate change drought mitigation and disaster risk reduction strategies in Pakistan. Thus, these drought indices have been confirmed to be a complete drought monitoring indicator and reduce the risk of drought in Pakistan.

Climate change represents a significant and growing threat to population health. Rural areas face unique challenges, such as high rates of vulnerable populations; economic uncertainty due to their reliance on industries that are vulnerable to climate change; less resilient infrastructure; and lower levels of access to community and emergency services than urban areas. This article fills a gap in public health practice by developing climate and health environmental public health indicators for a local public health department in a rural area. We adapted the National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network's framework for climate and health indicators to a seven-county health department in Western Kentucky. Using a three-step review process, we identified primary climate-related environmental public health hazards for the region (extreme heat, drought, and flooding) and a suite of related exposure, health outcome, population vulnerability, and environmental vulnerability indicators. Indicators that performed more poorly at the county level than at the state and national level were defined as "high vulnerability." Six to eight high vulnerability indicators were identified for each county. The local health department plans to use the results to enhance three key areas of existing services: epidemiology, public health preparedness, and community health assessment.

Global climate change is expected to affect waterborne enteric diseases, yet to date there has been no comprehensive, systematic review of the epidemiological literature examining the relationship between meteorological conditions and diarrheal diseases. We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Collection for studies describing the relationship between diarrheal diseases and four meteorological conditions that are expected to increase with climate change: ambient temperature, heavy rainfall, drought, and flooding. We synthesized key areas of agreement and evaluated the biological plausibility of these findings, drawing from a diverse, multidisciplinary evidence base. We identified 141 articles that met our inclusion criteria. Key areas of agreement include a positive association between ambient temperature and diarrheal diseases, with the exception of viral diarrhea and an increase in diarrheal disease following heavy rainfall and flooding events. Insufficient evidence was available to evaluate the effects of drought on diarrhea. There is evidence to support the biological plausibility of these associations, but publication bias is an ongoing concern. Future research evaluating whether interventions, such as improved water and sanitation access, modify risk would further our understanding of the potential impacts of climate change on diarrheal diseases and aid in the prioritization of adaptation measures.

Beneficial Root-Associated Microbiome during Drought and Flooding Stress in Plants.
Nio SA, Mantilen Ludong DP.
Crop productivity is seriously threatened by the rise in the frequency and severity of drought and flood events around the world. Reduced drought and flooding stress in vulnerable species and ecosystems depends on our ability to comprehend how drought and flooding affect plant physiology and plant-associated microbes. Involvement of both abscisic acid ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways has been noted during drought. Hypoxic conditions impede hydraulic conductance, nutrient uptake and plant growth and development, as well as root aerobic respiration. The root microbiome, which works with the roots during drought and flood, is made up of plant growth-promoting rhizosphere, endophytes and mycorrhizas. A large number of phytohormones, primarily auxins, cytokinin and ethylene, as well as enzymes like 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-Carboxylate deaminase (ACC deaminase) and metabolites like exopolysaccharides are produced by rhizospheric microbes. These phytohormones, enzymes and metabolites have role in the induction of systemic drought tolerance in plants. Under hypoxia, anaerobic microbes with the potential to harm the plant due to their pathogenic behavior or soil denitrification ability are more likely to be present in the rhizosphere and roots. This review concentrates on the primary mechanisms of plant-microbe interactions under drought and flood stress as well as the importance of flood and drought-tolerant microbes in maintaining and increasing crop plant productivity under stress.

This chapter of the New York City Panel on Climate Change 4 (NPCC4) report provides a comprehensive description of the different types of flood hazards (pluvial, fluvial, coastal, groundwater, and compound) facing New York City and provides climatological context that can be utilized, along with climate change projections, to support flood risk management (FRM). Previous NPCC reports documented coastal flood hazards and presented trends in historical and future precipitation and sea level but did not comprehensively assess all the city's flood hazards. Previous NPCC reports also discussed the implications of floods on infrastructure and the city's residents but did not review the impacts of flooding on the city's natural and nature-based systems (NNBSs). This-the NPCC's first report focused on all drivers of flooding-describes and profiles historical examples of each type of flood and summarizes previous and ongoing research regarding exposure, vulnerability, and risk management, including with NNBS and nonstructural measures.

The Nepali population is among those most vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change. We conducted a systematic literature review to document the health effects of climate change in Nepal and identify knowledge gaps by examining vulnerability categories related to health. Three databases were searched for journal articles that addressed health and vulnerability related to climate change in Nepal from 2010 onwards. Of the 1063 articles identified, 37 were eligible for inclusion. The findings suggested the health of the population was affected mostly by food insecurity, floods, droughts, and reduced water levels. Studies revealed both morbidity and mortality increased due to climate change, with the most impacted populations being women, children, and the elderly. At greatest risk for impacts from climate change were those from poor and marginal populations, especially impoverished women. The public health sector, healthcare, and potable water sources were some of the least mentioned vulnerability subcategories, indicating more research is needed to better understand their adaptation capacities. We propose that identifying vulnerabilities and areas of limited research are critical steps in the prioritization of health policy and interventions for the most vulnerable populations in Nepal.

Global climate change has altered precipitation patterns and disrupted the characteristics of drought and rainfall events. Climate projections confirm that more frequent, intense, and extreme droughts and rainfall events will continue. However, knowledge around how drought and wet events move dynamically through space and time is limited, especially in the southern hemisphere. Australia is the driest inhabited continent, renowned as the land of droughts and flooding rains, but recent climate-driven changes to the severity of wildfires and floods have garnered global attention. Here we used S-TRACK, a novel method for spatial drought tracking, to build pathways for past drought and wet events in Australia to examine their spatiotemporal dynamics. Characteristics such as duration, severity, and intensity were obtained from these pathways, and modified Mann-Kendall tests and Sen's slope were used to detect significant trends in characteristics over time. Drought conditions in southern Australia have intensified, particularly in the southwest of Australia and Tasmania, while the north of the country is experiencing longer, more severe, and more intense wet conditions. We also found that the location of drought and wet hotspots has clearly shifted in response to precipitation changes since the 1970's. Finally, pathways for the most extreme events show peak severity is reached in the middle to late stages of pathways, and that the largest drought and wet areas of a pathway have moved further west in recent times. The findings in this study provide the necessary knowledge to improve preparedness for extreme precipitation events as they become more common and to inform predictions for agricultural output or the extent of other climate events such as wildfires and flooding.

Droughts and floods are weather-related hazards affecting cities in all climate zones and causing human deaths and material losses on all inhabited continents. The aim of this article is to review, analyse and discuss in detail the problems faced by urban ecosystems due to water surplus and scarcity, as well as the need of adaptation to climate change taking into account the legislation, current challenges and knowledge gaps. The literature review indicated that urban floods are much more recognised than urban droughts. Amongst floods, flash floods are currently the most challenging, which by their nature are difficult to monitor. Research and adaptation measures related to water-released hazards use cutting-edge technologies for risk assessment, decision support systems, or early warning systems, among others, but in all areas knowledge gaps for urban droughts are evident. Increasing urban retention and introducing Low Impact Development and Nature-based Solutions is a remedy for both droughts and floods in cities.

Climate change, one of the severest environmental threats to humankind, disproportionately affects low-income, developing countries in the Global South. Having no feasible mitigation alternatives, these countries resort to adaptation efforts to address climate perturbations. Climate change adaptation (or resilience) is primarily a localized course of action that depends on individuals, social networks, economies, ecologies, political structures, and the capabilities of all those to work collectively to absorb, learn from, and transform in the face of new realities. With a view to controlling the floods that shattered the life and economy of the then East Pakistan, which is now Bangladesh, during the mid-twentieth century, the coastal embankment project (CEP) was instituted as an adaptation strategy to natural disasters in Southwestern Bangladesh. Based on a qualitative analysis of primary and secondary data, this paper seeks to critically evaluate the efficacy of the CEP in terms of the space for feasible action and ecological modernization. The findings of this research indicate that the CEP has become an unrealistic venture that hinders the growing economic activity of shrimp aquaculture in the area. This paper is expected to contribute to generating further theoretical and empirical discourse on the evaluation of similar development projects around the globe.

Understanding crop yield and water requirements in response to the future climate at the local scale is essential to develop more precise and appropriate adaptation strategies. From this perspective, repeated drought and flood events in the lower north of Thailand were investigated. The objectives of the study were to evaluate the impact of climate change on major crop yields and the water footprint (WF). Five global circulation model datasets from the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), known as Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), were selected. Three future periods: near (2015-2039), mid (2040-2069), and far future (2070-2100) under SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios were used to predict the major crop yields and WF changes in the future. The precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures were projected to increase in all periods under both scenarios. Rice yields in irrigated areas were predicted to rise gradually over the three projection periods under SSP245 but decline in mid and far-future periods under SSP585. There was a predicted reduction of first and second rice crop yields by -6.0% to -17.7% under SSP585. Fortunately, those rice yields were expected to increase in the near-future period under SSP245 by 3.0% to 4.3%. Growing maize, soybean, or mung bean instead of a second rice crop will have a less negative impact on future climate change. Changing from growing rice to be planting maize twice per year and growing cassava had increased favorability in rain-fed areas. The WF changes in the future were associated with future crop yield changes; therefore, the decrease in WFs was due to an increase in crop yield and vice-versa. The total WFs of maize, soybean, mung bean, and cassava production were roughly half that of rice production, indicating that these crops are suitable alternatives in the dry season.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is clear evidence that the earth's climate is changing, largely from anthropogenic causes. Flooding and tropical cyclones have clear impacts on human health in the United States at present, and projections of their health impacts in the future will help inform climate policy, yet to date there have been few quantitative climate health impact projections. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite a wealth of studies characterizing health impacts of floods and tropical cyclones, many are better suited for qualitative, rather than quantitative, projections of climate change health impacts. However, a growing number have features that will facilitate their use in quantitative projections, features we highlight here. Further, while it can be difficult to project how exposures to flood and tropical cyclone hazards will change in the future, climate science continues to advance in its capabilities to capture changes in these exposures, including capturing regional variation. Developments in climate epidemiology and climate science are opening new possibilities in projecting the health impacts of floods and tropical cyclones under a changing climate.

In recent decades, climate change is exacerbating meteorological disasters around the world, causing more serious urban flood disaster losses. Many solutions in related research have been proposed to enhance urban adaptation to climate change, including urban flooding simulations, risk reduction and urban flood-resistance capacity. In this paper we provide a thorough review of urban flood-resilience using scientometric and systematic analysis. Using Cite Space and VOS viewer, we conducted a scientometric analysis to quantitively analyze related papers from the Web of Science Core Collection from 1999 to 2021 with urban flood resilience as the keyword. We systematically summarize the relationship of urban flood resilience, including co-citation analysis of keywords, authors, research institutions, countries, and research trends. The scientometric results show that four stages can be distinguished to indicate the evolution of different keywords in urban flood management from 1999, and urban flood resilience has become a research hotspot with a significant increase globally since 2015. The research methods and progress of urban flood resilience in these four related fields are systematically analyzed, including climate change, urban planning, urban system adaptation and urban flood-simulation models. Climate change has been of high interest in urban flood-resilience research. Urban planning and the adaptation of urban systems differ in terms of human involvement and local policies, while more dynamic factors need to be jointly described. Models are mostly evaluated with indicators, and comprehensive resilience studies based on traditional models are needed for multi-level and higher performance models. Consequently, more studies about urban flood resilience based on local policies and dynamics within global urban areas combined with fine simulation are needed in the future, improving the concept of resilience as applied to urban flood-risk-management and assessment.

[Climate changes, floods, and health consequences].
[Article in Italian]
Michelozzi P, de' Donato F.
In the European Region, floods are the most common natural disaster, causing extensive damage and disruption. In Italy, it has been estimated that over 68% of municipalities are at high hydrogeological risk and with the recent intense rainfall events local populations have been facing severe disruptions. The health consequences of floods are wide ranging and are dependent upon the vulnerability of the environment and the local population. Health effects can be a direct or indirect consequence of flooding. The immediate health impacts of floods include drowning, heart attacks, injuries and hypothermia. The indirect effects include, injuries and infections, water-borne infectious disease, mental health problems, respiratory disease and allergies in both the medium and long term after a flood. Future efforts should be addressed to integrate health preparedness and prevention measures into emergency flood plans and hydrological warning systems.

PURPOSE: Rising global temperatures have resulted in an increased frequency and severity of cyclones, hurricanes, and flooding in many parts of the world. These climate change-related water disasters (CCRWDs) have a devastating impact on communities and the health of residents. Clinicians and policymakers require a substantive body of evidence on which to base planning, prevention, and disaster response to these events. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature concerning the impact of CCRWDs on public health in order to identify factors in these events that are amenable to preparedness and mitigation. Ultimately, this evidence could be used by nurses to advocate for greater preparedness initiatives and inform national and international disaster policy. DESIGN AND METHODS: A systematic literature review of publications identified through a comprehensive search of five relevant databases (PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature [CINAHL], Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science) was conducted using a modified Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach in January 2017 to describe major themes and associated factors of the impact of CCRWDs on population health. FINDINGS: Three major themes emerged: environmental disruption resulting in exposure to toxins, population susceptibility, and health systems infrastructure (failure to plan-prepare-mitigate, inadequate response, and lack of infrastructure). Direct health impact was characterized by four major categories: weather-related morbidity and mortality, waterborne diseases/water-related illness, vector-borne and zoonotic diseases, and psychiatric/mental health effects. Scope and duration of the event are factors that exacerbate the impact of CCRWDs. Discussion of specific factors amenable to mitigation was limited. Flooding as an event was overrepresented in this analysis (60%), and the majority of the research reviewed was conducted in high-income or upper middle-/high-income countries (62%), despite the fact that low-income countries bear a disproportionate share of the burden on morbidity and mortality from CCRWDs. CONCLUSIONS: Empirical evidence related to CCRWDs is predominately descriptive in nature, characterizing the cascade of climatic shifts leading to major environmental disruption and exposure to toxins, and their resultant morbidity and mortality. There is inadequate representation of research exploring potentially modifiable factors associated with CCRWDs and their impact on population health. This review lays the foundation for a wide array of further areas of analysis to explore the negative health impacts of CCRWDs and for nurses to take a leadership role in identifying and advocating for evidence-based policies to plan, prevent, or mitigate these effects. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Nurses comprise the largest global healthcare workforce and are in a position to advocate for disaster preparedness for CCRWDs, develop more robust environmental health policies, and work towards mitigating exposure to environmental toxins that may threaten human health.

Due to climate change, the frequency and intensity of droughts are expected to increase. To improve resilience to droughts, proactive drought management is essential. Economic assessments are typically included to decide on the drought risk-reducing investments to make. The choice of both methods and scope of economic assessments influences the outcome, and thus the investment choice. This paper aims to identify how comprehensively economic assessments are applied in practice. Through a systematic literature review, 14 actual economic assessments are identified and their methods are evaluated based on seven criteria for economic assessments as derived from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The results show that in practice, economic assessments rarely address all criteria. Applying a limited number of criteria reduces the scope and narrows the approach, possibly leading to the underestimation of drought risk reduction approaches' related benefits. Applying the seven criteria in practice will improve the results of economic assessments of drought risk reduction measures, allowing for optimal investment selection. Based on the different criteria, a Framework for Economic Assessments of Drought Risk-Reducing Applications (FEADRRA) is proposed. Applying the criteria of the framework can support decision-makers in drought risk management and in carrying out the most fitting drought interventions.
