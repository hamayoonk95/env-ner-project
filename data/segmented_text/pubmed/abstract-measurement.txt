Bicycling holds promise as a healthy and sustainable means of transportation and physical activity.
Despite the growing interest in community-based environmental approaches to promoting physical activity, bikeability has received relatively little attention.
This paper provides a scoping review of the instruments developed to measure bikeability along with practice-based analyses of the tools related to user expertise, estimated cost, and required time to implement.
The review summarizes the literature, identifies research gaps, and informs stakeholders with articles from EBSCO and transportation databases published after 2003 when the previous bikeability instrument review paper was published.
Data extraction included the tool name, data collection method, study location, data collection scale, type of measure, and description.
Two reviewers independently reviewed articles included in the full text review, and the inter-rater agreement exceeded 90%.
The database search yielded 388 unique articles, and 17 met the inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Most of the studies, 11 of 17, were applied to settings outside of the U.S.
Five studies employed a self-report survey, and five studies examined bikeability using geospatial data, like GIS.
Seven studies used a direct observation audit tool-one specifically using a mobile app and another using virtual observation techniques with Google Street View.
Bikeability tools are useful for assessing communities and their supports for bicycling.
Our primary finding is that advances in technology over the past two decades have driven innovative and useful methodologies, in a variety of disciplines, for assessing the environment, but more consensus is needed to provide a universal definition of bikeability.

There is growing interest in the use of physical activity and nutrition environmental measures by both researchers and practitioners.
Built environment assessment methods and tools range from simple to complex and encompass perceived, observed, and geographic data collection.
Even though challenges in tool selection and use may exist for non-researchers, there are opportunities to incorporate these measures into practice.
The aims of this paper are to (1) describe examples of built environment assessment methods and tools in the practice context; (2) present case studies that outline successful approaches for the use of built environment assessment tools and data among practitioners; and (3) make recommendations for both research and practice.
As part of the Built Environment Assessment Training Think Tank meeting in July 2013, experts who work with community partners gathered to provide input on conceptualizing recommendations for collecting and analyzing built environment data in practice and research.
The methods were summarized in terms of perceived environment measures, observational measures, and geographic measures for physical activity and food environment assessment.
Challenges are outlined and case study examples of successful use of assessments in practice are described.
Built environment assessment tools and measures are important outside the research setting.
There is a need for improved collaboration between research and practice in forming partnerships for developing tools, collecting and analyzing data, and using the results to work toward positive environmental changes.

Urban climate influences economic activities and the health and safety of urban residents.
Therefore, monitoring temperature in urban areas is important.
However, owing to the lack of space for an appropriate observation site, an automatic weather station (AWS) was installed on a building rooftop.
The rooftop installation can indicate temperature differences depending on the intensity of strong solar radiation and radiant heat of the building, and wind speed.
Therefore, in this study, we aimed to provide observation standards for measuring rooftop temperature according to the optimal rooftop material and observation height.
Specifically, an AWS was installed on the rooftop of the Gochang Standard Weather Station (GSWO), Jeollabuk-do Province, to observe the urban climate in South Korea and establish suitable weather standards.
Different temperatures, optimum surface materials, and optimum heights for measuring the temperature at the rooftop of GSWO were investigated and compared over 1 year.
The temperature recorded after installing a palm mat on the rooftop was more similar to that observed in the grassland.
Furthermore, the installation height of the temperature sensor of 2.5-3.0 m for the palm mat and 3.5-4.0 m for concrete was found to be the optimal height for observing temperature at the rooftop.

Urban wet-weather discharges from combined sewer overflows (CSO) and stormwater outlets (SWO) are a potential pathway for micropollutants (trace contaminants) to surface waters, posing a threat to the environment and possible water reuse applications.
Despite large efforts to monitor micropollutants in the last decade, the gained information is still limited and scattered.
In a metastudy we performed a data-driven analysis of measurements collected at 77 sites (683 events, 297 detected micropollutants) over the last decade to investigate which micropollutants are most relevant in terms of 1) occurrence and 2) potential risk for the aquatic environment, 3) estimate the minimum number of data to be collected in monitoring studies to reliably obtain concentration estimates, and 4) provide recommendations for future monitoring campaigns.
We highlight micropollutants to be prioritized due to their high occurrence and critical concentration levels compared to environmental quality standards.
These top-listed micropollutants include contaminants from all chemical classes (pesticides, heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, personal care products, pharmaceuticals, and industrial and household chemicals).
Analysis of over 30,000 event mean concentrations shows a large fraction of measurements (> 50%) were below the limit of quantification, stressing the need for reliable, standard monitoring procedures.
High variability was observed among events and sites, with differences between micropollutant classes.
The number of events required for a reliable estimate of site mean concentrations (error bandwidth of 1 around the "true" value) depends on the individual micropollutant.
The median minimum number of events is 7 for CSO (2 to 31, 80%-interquantile) and 6 for SWO (1 to 25 events, 80%-interquantile).
Our analysis indicates the minimum number of sites needed to assess global pollution levels and our data collection and analysis can be used to estimate the required number of sites for an urban catchment.
Our data-driven analysis demonstrates how future wet-weather monitoring programs will be more effective if the consequences of high variability inherent in urban wet-weather discharges are considered.

The roundabout is one type of at-grade intersection commonly seen in many countries.
The evaluation of roundabout safety is usually counted on conflict analysis of the roundabout traffic due to random and limited records of real accidents.
This paper surveyed published papers and reports that investigate the role of traffic conflicts in roundabout safety evaluation.
It summarized the definitions and observation methods of roundabout conflicts and classified the attributing factors of roundabout conflicts and the countermeasures to control the conflicts.
This study found that although unique traffic flow movements at roundabouts create special patterns of roundabout conflicts, the methods of roundabout conflict analysis used in most existing studies were inherited from the studies of highway or cross-intersection conflicts, including conflict definitions, conflict measurements, and thresholds of conflict severity.
Special or improper designs of roundabout configurations or basic geometry elements could arouse roundabout conflicts.
The most common vehicle-to-vehicle conflicts were entering-circulating conflicts, sideswipe conflicts, and exiting-circulating conflicts.
The conflicts among vehicles and vulnerable road users (VRUs) easily evolved into serious collisions, but these conflicts did not get deserved attention in previous studies.
Drivers' familiarity with roundabouts also affected road users' safety.
Traffic signs and pavement markings were commonly used to control roundabout conflicts, while traffic signals were more effective methods for the roundabouts with uneven distribution of approaching traffic or high traffic volume.
Based on the analysis of existing studies, this paper pointed out seven future directions of further research in term of conflict measurement, data collection, infrastructure and access management, geometry, drivers and VRUs, signal control, and vehicle control.

The Art of Observation: A Pedagogical Framework.

Observational skills, honed through experience with the literary and visual arts, bring together in a timely manner many of the goals of the medical humanities, providing thematic cohesion through the act of seeing while aiming to advance clinical skills through a unified practice.
In an arts observation pedagogy, nature writing serves as an apt model for precise, clinically relevant linguistic noticing because meticulous attention to the natural world involves scientific precision; additionally, a number of visual metaphors employed in medicine are derived from close observation of the natural world.
Close reading reinforces observational skills as part of integrative, multidisciplinary clinical practice.
Literary precision provides an educational bridge to recognizing the importance of detail in the clinical realm.
In weighing multiple perspectives, observation applied to practice helps learners understand the nuances of the role of witness, activating reflection consonant with the viewer's professional identity.
The realization that seeing is highly filtered through the observer's values allows the act of observation to come under scrutiny, opening the observer's gaze to disturbance and challenging the values and precepts of the prevailing medical culture.
Application of observational skills can, for example, help observers recognize and address noxious effects of the built environment.
As learners describe what they see, they also develop the communication skills needed to articulate both problems and possible improvements within their expanding sphere of influence.
The ability to craft this speech as public narrative can lead to interventions with positive impacts on physicians, their colleagues, and patients.

Data capturing multiple axes of tree size and shape, such as a tree's stem diameter, height and crown size, underpin a wide range of ecological research-from developing and testing theory on forest structure and dynamics, to estimating forest carbon stocks and their uncertainties, and integrating remote sensing imagery into forest monitoring programmes.
However, these data can be surprisingly hard to come by, particularly for certain regions of the world and for specific taxonomic groups, posing a real barrier to progress in these fields.
To overcome this challenge, we developed the Tallo database, a collection of 498,838 georeferenced and taxonomically standardized records of individual trees for which stem diameter, height and/or crown radius have been measured.
These data were collected at 61,856 globally distributed sites, spanning all major forested and non-forested biomes.
The majority of trees in the database are identified to species (88%), and collectively Tallo includes data for 5163 species distributed across 1453 genera and 187 plant families.
The database is publicly archived under a CC-BY 4.0 licence and can be access from: To demonstrate its value, here we present three case studies that highlight how the Tallo database can be used to address a range of theoretical and applied questions in ecology-from testing the predictions of metabolic scaling theory, to exploring the limits of tree allometric plasticity along environmental gradients and modelling global variation in maximum attainable tree height.
In doing so, we provide a key resource for field ecologists, remote sensing researchers and the modelling community working together to better understand the role that trees play in regulating the terrestrial carbon cycle.

BACKGROUND:
Temperature affects influenza transmission; however, currently, limited evidence exists about its effect in China at the national and city levels as well as how temperature can be integrated into influenza interventions.
METHODS:
Meteorological, pollutant, and influenza data from 201 cities in mainland China between 2013 and 2018 were analyzed at both the city and national levels to investigate the relationship between temperature and influenza prevalence.
We examined the impact of temperature on the time-varying reproduction number (Rt) using generalized additive quasi-Poisson regression models combined with the distributed lag nonlinear model.
Threshold temperatures were determined for seven regions based on the early warning threshold of serious influenza outbreaks, set at Rt = 1.2.
A multivariate random-effects meta-analysis was employed to assess region-specific associations.
The excess risk (ER) index was defined to investigate the correlation between Rt and temperature, modified based on seasonal and regional characteristics.
RESULTS: At the national level and in the central, northern, northwestern, and southern regions, temperature was found to be negatively correlated with relative risk, whereas the shapes of the data curves for the eastern, southwestern, and northeastern regions were not well defined.
Low temperatures had an observable effect on influenza prevalence; however, the effects of high temperatures were not obvious.
At an Rt of 1.2, the threshold temperatures for reaching a warning for serious influenza outbreaks were - 24.3 °C in the northeastern region, 16.6 °C in the northwestern region, and between 1°C and 10 °C in other regions.
CONCLUSION:
The study findings revealed that temperature had a varying effect on influenza transmission trends (Rt) across different regions in China.
By identifying region-specific temperature thresholds at Rt = 1.2, more effective early warning systems for influenza outbreaks could be tailored.
These findings emphasize the significance of the region-specific adaptation of influenza prevention and control measures.

The diminutive colon polyp: biopsy, snare, leave alone?

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Diminutive polyps, measuring between 1 and 5 mm, represent the vast majority of colorectal polyps encountered during screening colonoscopy.
Although the chance of harboring advanced adenoma or neoplastic cells is low, ensuring a complete polyp resection with clear margins is crucial to reduce the risk of interval colorectal cancer.
The purpose of this review was to evaluate the different methods applied for polypectomy of diminutive polyps and clarify whether a diminutive polyp should be retrieved or left in place.
RECENT FINDINGS: Cold biopsy polypectomy is indicated for resection of polyps measuring 1-3 mm and removal of 4-5 mm polyps should be ensured by cold snare polypectomy.
Over the last decade, hot biopsy polypectomy has been gradually abandoned because of an increased risk of diathermic injury.
The resect and discard strategy and the diagnose and disregard strategy should be performed only by expert endoscopists, who should use validated scales and document the polyp features by storing several endoscopic images.
SUMMARY:
Nowadays, complete resection of diminutive polyps, following the most appropriate technique, is recommended in clinical practice.
The resect and discard strategy and the diagnose and disregard strategy should be reserved to expert endoscopists.

Discontinuity in pastoral development: time to update the method.
Most off-the-shelf basic methodological tools currently used in pastoral development (e.g. technical definitions and conventional scales of observation) retain underlying assumptions about stability and uniformity being the norm (i.e. 'equilibrium thinking').
Such assumptions reflect a theoretical framework which had been questioned since the 1970s and was openly disproved in scientific circles during the 1990s, when it was shown to be fundamentally inadequate.
Today, lingering equilibrium assumptions in the methodological legacy of pastoral development get in the way of operationalising state-of-the-art understanding of pastoral systems and drylands.
Unless these barriers are identified, unpacked and managed, even increasing the rigour and intensity of data collection will not deliver a realistic representation of pastoral systems in statistics and policymaking.
This article provides a range of examples of such 'barriers', where equilibrium assumptions persist in the methodology, including classifications of livestock systems, conventional scales of observation, key parameters in animal production, indicators in the measurement of ecological efficiency, and the concepts of 'fragile environment', natural resources, and pastoral risk.
Publisher: Les outils méthodologiques de base et prêts à
l’emploi en matière de développement pastoral (par exemple, les définitions techniques, les grilles classiques d’observation)
reposent encore pour la plupart sur un certain nombre de postulats concernant la stabilité et l’uniformité considérées comme la norme (le « paradigme de l’équilibre »).
Le cadre théorique reflété par ces présupposés a été remis en cause dès les années 1970 puis ouvertement réfuté dans les cercles scientifiques au cours des années 1990, avec la démonstration de son caractère foncièrement inadéquat.
À l’heure actuelle, la persistance du présupposé d’équilibre dans la tradition méthodologique du développement pastoral constitue un obstacle à
la mise en place d’une compréhension moderne des systèmes pastoraux et des terres arides.
En dépit d’une collecte de données de plus en plus rigoureuse et intense, tant que ces obstacles n’auront pas été reconnus, démontés et levés, il sera impossible d’obtenir une représentation réaliste des systèmes pastoraux dans les statistiques et les prises de décision. L’auteur présente une série d’exemples de barrières liées aux présupposés persistants d’équilibre dans la méthodologie, en particulier : les classifications des systèmes d’élevage ; les grilles classiques d’observation ; les principaux paramètres de la production animale ; les indicateurs d’efficacité écologique ; et les concepts d’ « environnement fragile », de ressources naturelles et de risque pastoral.
Publisher: La mayoría de las principales herramientas metodológicas estandarizadas que se emplean para estudiar el desarrollo del pastoreo (definiciones técnicas y escalas convencionales de observación, por ejemplo) siguen reposando en premisas que hacen de la estabilidad y la uniformidad la norma (el llamado «pensamiento del equilibrio»).
Estas premisas emanan de un marco teórico de referencia que fue puesto en tela de juicio a partir del decenio de 1970 y que los círculos científicos desautorizaron sin ambages en los años noventa, tras demostrar que era fundamentalmente inapropiado.
Hoy en día, la enquistada presencia de los postulados del equilibrio en el legado metodológico que se utiliza para estudiar el desarrollo del pastoreo supone un obstáculo a la hora de aplicar en la práctica una comprensión moderna de los sistemas pastorales y las tierras áridas.
Sin reconocer, desagregar y abordar estos obstáculos previamente no será posible, incluso reuniendo datos de modo más intenso y riguroso, obtener una imagen realista de los sistemas pastorales con fines de estadística o de elaboración de políticas.
El autor ofrece una serie de ejemplos de tales «obstáculos», por los cuales los postulados del equilibrio siguen lastrando la metodología, en particular las clasificaciones de los sistemas ganaderos, las escalas convencionales de observación, los parámetros básicos de producción animal, los indicadores que miden la eficiencia ecológica o los conceptos de «medio frágil», recursos naturales y riesgo pastoral.

The Tara Pacific expedition (2016-2018) sampled coral ecosystems around 32 islands in the Pacific Ocean and the ocean surface waters at 249 locations, resulting in the collection of nearly 58 000 samples.
The expedition was designed to systematically study warm-water coral reefs and included the collection of corals, fish, plankton, and seawater samples for advanced biogeochemical, molecular, and imaging analysis.
Here we provide a complete description of the sampling methodology, and we explain how to explore and access the different datasets generated by the expedition.
Environmental context data were obtained from taxonomic registries, gazetteers, almanacs, climatologies, operational biogeochemical models, and satellite observations.
The quality of the different environmental measures has been validated not only by various quality control steps, but also through a global analysis allowing the comparison with known environmental large-scale structures.
Such publicly released datasets open the perspective to address a wide range of scientific questions.

The Generation R Study is a population-based prospective cohort study from fetal life until adulthood.
The study is designed to identify early environmental and genetic causes and causal pathways leading to normal and abnormal growth, development and health from fetal life, childhood and young adulthood.
In total, 9,778 mothers were enrolled in the study.
Data collection in children and their parents include questionnaires, interviews, detailed physical and ultrasound examinations, behavioural observations, Magnetic Resonance Imaging and biological samples.
Efforts have been conducted for collecting biological samples including blood, hair, faeces, nasal swabs, saliva and urine samples and generating genomics data on DNA, RNA and microbiome.
In this paper, we give an update of the collection, processing and storage of these biological samples and available measures.
Together with detailed phenotype measurements, these biological samples provide a unique resource for epidemiological studies focused on environmental exposures, genetic and genomic determinants and their interactions in relation to growth, health and development from fetal life onwards.

Effective water quality management is based on associations between at least two pieces of information: a stressor and a response.
However, assessments are hindered by the lack of pre-developed stressor-response associations.
To remedy this, I developed genus stressor-specific sensitivity values (SVs) for up to 704 genera to estimate a sensitive genera ratio (SGR) metric for as many as 34 common stream stressors.
The SVs were estimated from a large, paired macroinvertebrate and environmental data set for the contiguous United States.
Environmental variables measuring potential stressors were selected that were generally uncorrelated and usually had several thousand station observations.
I calculated relative abundance weighted averages (WA) for each genus and environmental variable meeting data requirements in a calibration data set.
Each environmental variable was split into 10 intervals along each stressor gradient.
Genera were assigned an SV from 1 to 10 based on the interval consistent with the WA for each environmental parameter.
Using the calibration derived SVs, SGRs were calculated for the calibration and a validation subsets.
SGRs are the number of genera with SV ≤ 5 divided by the total number of genera in a sample.
In general, as stress increased, the SGR (range: 0-1) decreased for many environmental variables, but for five environmental variables, the decrease was not consistent.
The 95 % confidence intervals of the mean of the SGRs were greater for least disturbed stations compared to all other stations for 23 of the remaining 29 environmental variables.
Regional performance of SGRs was evaluated by subdividing the calibration data set into West, Central, and East subsets and recalculating SVs.
SGR mean absolute errors were smallest in the East and Central regions.
These stressor-specific SVs expand the available tools for assessing stream biological impairments from commonly encountered environmental stressors.

The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) serves as a collection of unique ecosystems featured as oligotrophic and hypometabolic conditions, and is particularly vulnerable to threats posed by anthropogenic and natural disturbances.
Active fluvial processes on the QTP, especially the lateral migration of rivers and channel abandonment accompanied by variations in the hydrological connectivity, and changes in river geomorphology, intensively modify this highland river-floodplain system.
However, little is known about how these processes alter the trophic characteristics of highland river system on earth.
In this study, we conducted field investigations on a typical meandering river, the Quanji River (QR), located in the northeastern QTP by sampling macroinvertebrates, surveying trophic sources, and measuring a range of environmental conditions.
Based on the collected data, we identified four biotopes for the QR through hierarchical clustering, established the representative food web for each biotope through the allometric diet breadth model, and estimated the biomass storage and flux within food web for each biotope through the biomass balance model.
Our results show that the identified biotopes differed markedly in hydrological connectivity.
Biotopes 1 and 2, which were in the main river channel represented the condition of high connectivity, Biotope 3 in the open channel represented the median connectivity, while Biotope 4 in the semi-open/closed channel represented the low connectivity.
In contrast to the unimodal pattern commonly observed in lowland rivers, indices for the highland QR, including the taxa richness, trophic group richness, biomass flux, biomass transfer efficiency, and trophic stability demonstrated a single-valley response pattern to the hydrological connectivity.
We argue that the intermediate disturbance hypothesis still works on highland river ecosystems, whereas the optimal disturbance occurs in the low connectivity rather than median connectivity.
We attribute this skewness to the low resistance and resilience of highland macroinvertebrate community in the face of hydrodynamic disturbances brought by flood events, and the biological disturbances from the predation by endemic migratory fish (Gymnocypris przewalskii) in QR.
This study reveals that lateral migration and channel abandonment play important roles in highland river systems in the QTP in the context of biological and energetic perspectives and suggests that management strategies for highland rivers should be made different from those of lowland rivers.
