Human activities have led to the loss of critical habitats for aquatic species at such an accelerated rate that habitat modification is considered a leading threat to biodiversity.
Sharks and rays are considered the second most threatened group of vertebrates that have also suffered from habitat loss, especially in nursery grounds and reef-associated species.
In this sense, actions toward the conservation of critical grounds for species survival are urgently needed, especially for those threatened with extinction.
This study aimed to gather and provide information on the worldwide distribution and habitat association of the 'vulnerable' Atlantic Nurse Shark Ginglymostoma cirratum through a literature review performed at the Dimensions research database.
A total of 30 studies published between 1950 and 2021 were retained since they defined at least the type of habitat in which G. cirratum was associated.
Most studies covered the Floridian ecoregion, where G. cirratum is more common and abundant.
Reefs, seagrass, sandy, rocky, mangrove, and macroalgae accounted for the majority of habitat associations, with a higher diversity of habitats detected within marine protected areas (MPAs).
Ginglymostoma cirratum was recorded at a maximum depth of 75 m, temperatures ranging from 25 °C to 34 °C, and salinities between 31 and 38 ppt.
Neonates were associated with shallower habitats (<20 m), mostly reefs, rocks, macroalgae, sandy shores, and seagrass, in an average temperature of 26 °C and salinity of 36 ppt.
Breeding events and habitats were reported by 11 studies, 72.7% of them in shallow waters, mostly inside MPAs (90.9%).
Our findings highlighted the key role played by MPAs in protecting essential grounds for threatened species, such as the Atlantic Nurse Shark.
Major ecoregions (e.g., the Eastern Atlantic) are still underrepresented in the scientific literature as long as studies aim specifically to assess G. cirratum habitat association.
Thus, further insights into the essential habitats needed to conserve the Atlantic Nurse Shark can still emerge from future studies.
Considering the recent IUCN extinction risk status change in G. cirratum (i.e., Data Deficient to 'Vulnerable'), new conservation measures that integrate habitat protection and management are urgently needed and should consider the data collected herein.

Intraguild predation is thought to be ubiquitous in natural food webs.
Yet, theory on intraguild predation predicts the intraguild prey to persist only under limited conditions.
This gap between theory and empirical observations needs scrutiny.
One reason might be that theory has focused on equilibrium dynamics and a limited set of species (usually three) that interact in well-mixed populations in unstructured habitats, and these assumptions will often not hold in natural systems.
In this review, we focus on the effects of habitat structure on intraguild predation.
Habitat structure could reduce encounter rates between predators and prey and could create refuges for prey.
In both cases, habitat structure could reduce the strength of intraguild interactions, thereby facilitating species coexistence.
A meta-analysis of studies on manipulation of habitat structure shows that intraguild prey indeed suffer less from intraguild predation in structured habitats.
This was further confirmed by a meta-analysis in which studies on intraguild predation were classified according to habitat structure.
Intraguild predation reduced densities of the intraguild prey significantly more in habitats with little structure than in habitats rich in structure.
The effect of intraguild predation on the shared prey was negative, and not significantly affected by habitat structure.
We conclude that habitat structure may increase persistence of the intraguild prey by decreasing the strength of the interaction between intraguild predator and intraguild prey.

A review of the habitat restoration of giant pandas from 2012 to 2021: Research topics and advances.
Author information: (1)School of Ecology and Nature Conservation, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, China.
Electronic address: kangdw@bjfu.edu.cn.
The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is a flagship species in nature conservation.
Habitat degradation and fragmentation threaten the sustainable survival of giant pandas, and thus degraded habitats need to be restored and fragmented habitats require connection.
In the past ten years, some new studies have emerged on the habitat restoration of giant pandas, yet no specialized reviews of this topic have been published.
This paper reviews the habitat restoration of giant pandas based on related articles published between 2012 and 2021.
Three principal research topics are identified and summarized: restoration effect, restoration requirements, and restoration considerations.
The review demonstrates that some measures, such as protection projects and policies, controlling human disturbances and impacts, and natural recovery, contribute to the habitat restoration of giant pandas.
Many issues related to artificial forests need to be addressed to clarify their role in habitat restoration.
Many habitats with clear locations and types need restoration, especially those that are disturbed or threatened by human activities and some that are disturbed by natural disturbances such as earthquakes.
To integrate consideration factors, a reference habitat should be established and well described.
In addition, social and economic factors should not be ignored.
More targeted studies of the habitat restoration of giant pandas are urgently needed, including theoretical, cross-scale, interdisciplinary, multi-factor, and long-term monitoring studies.
This review provides a reference for future research work and a source of information for future restoration of giant panda habitat.

In recent decades, recurrent Ostreopsis spp.
blooms have been recorded throughout the globe, causing public health issues and mass mortalities of invertebrates.
Ostreopsis species are benthic and develop in shallow waters in close relation with a substrate, but possible substrate preferences are still ambiguous.
Bloom develops on both living and dead substrates and several interacting biotic and abiotic factors acting at different spatial scales can potentially foster or regulate Ostreopsis spp.
development.
The objective of this review is to collect and summarize information on Ostreopsis spp.
blooms related to the habitat at different spatial scales, in order to assess preferences and trends.
References including Ostreopsis spp.
samplings in the field were analysed in this review, as potentially including information about the micro- (substrate), meso‐ (community) and macrohabitat (ecosystem) related to Ostreopsis spp.
blooms.
The sampled substrate and the ecosystem where Ostreopsis spp. were collected were generally reported and described in the studies, while the description of the mesohabitat was rarely reported.
Ostreopsis spp. were generally described as attached to biotic substrates and in particular, macroalgae, even in studies conducted in coral reefs, where macroalgae are generally not dominant (but they can be in case of coral reef degradation).
In both temperate and tropical areas, Ostreopsis spp. were mostly sampled on algal species usually forming medium or low complexity communities (erect or turf-forming algae), often characteristic from post-regime shift scenarios, and rarely on canopy-forming species (such as fucoids and kelps).
This literature review highlights the need of collecting more information about the mesohabitat where important Ostreopsis spp.
blooms develop, as much as of the underlying mechanisms driving eventual differences on Ostreopsis spp.
abundances.
This knowledge would allow a better risk assessment of Ostreopsis spp.
blooms, identifying areas at high risk on the base of the benthic habitats.

Habitat restoration in spatially explicit metacommunity models.
Gawecka KA(1), Bascompte J(1).
Author information: (1)Department of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.
In a time of rapid habitat destruction threatening the existence of many species, restoration of degraded habitats plays a crucial role in hampering biodiversity decline and recovering ecosystem services.
The goal of this study is to advance the understanding of the consequences of habitat restoration on metacommunities, which is of upmost importance for designing successful restoration projects.
We approach habitat restoration from a theoretical perspective by analysing spatially explicit metacommunity models which have previously been essential to understanding the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation.
We investigate the efficiency of various restoration strategies on metacommunities involving interactions ranging from pairwise competition, predation and mutualism to more complex three-trophic modules.
Our novel approach for measuring the restoration efficiency enables direct comparison of the responses of species in different metacommunities.
We show that species recovery is affected by the amount of habitat destroyed, and the restoration strategy.
When habitat is restored by randomly selecting destroyed sites, species recovery becomes less efficient and more uncertain with increasing amount of previously destroyed habitat.
However, when the destroyed sites are restored in clusters, minimising the effects of fragmentation, species recovery and the certainty of success are substantially improved.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the community structure and the types of interactions involved determine the most efficient restoration approach.
Our findings highlight the importance of carefully planning the restoration process, especially in landscapes where a large proportion of habitat has been destroyed, and with species at the brink of extinction.
Our results may be used as guidelines for designing habitat restoration projects.

Habitat isolation interacts with top-down and bottom-up processes in a seagrass ecosystem.
Carroll EW(1), Freestone AL(2).
Author information: (1)Department of Biology, Holy Family University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.

Habitat loss is accelerating at unprecedented rates, leading to the emergence of smaller, more isolated habitat remnants.
Habitat isolation adversely affects many ecological processes independently, but little is known about how habitat isolation may interact with ecosystem processes such as top-down (consumer-driven) and bottom-up (resource-driven) effects.
To investigate the interactive influence of habitat isolation, resource availability and consumer distribution and impact on community structure, we tested two hypotheses using invertebrate and algal epibionts on temperate seagrasses, an ecosystem of ecological and conservation importance.
First, we hypothesized that habitat isolation will change the structure of the seagrass epibiont community, and isolated patches of seagrass will have lower epibiont biomass and different epibiont community composition than contiguous meadows.
Second, we hypothesized that habitat isolation would mediate top-down (i.e., herbivory) and bottom-up (i.e., nutrient enrichment) control for algal epibionts.
We used observational studies in natural seagrass patches and experimental artificial seagrass to examine three levels of habitat isolation.
We further manipulated top-down and bottom-up processes in artificial seagrass through consumer reductions and nutrient additions, respectively.
We indeed found that habitat isolation of seagrass patches decreased epibiont biomass and modified epibiont community composition.
This pattern was largely due to dispersal limitation of invertebrate epibionts that resulted in a decline in their abundance and richness in isolated patches.
Further, habitat isolation reduced consumer abundances, weakening top-down control of algal epibionts in isolated seagrass patches.
Nutrient additions, however, reversed this pattern, and allowed a top-down effect on algal richness to emerge in isolated habitats, demonstrating a complex interaction between patch isolation and top-down and bottom-up processes.
Habitat isolation may therefore shape the relative importance of central processes in ecosystems, leading to changes in community composition and food web structure in marine habitats.

Theory predicts that species engaged in intraguild predation (IGP) can only coexist under limited conditions, yet IGP is common in nature.
Habitat complexity can promote coexistence by reducing encounter rates, but little information is known about the contribution of differential habitat use.
We hypothesized that differential use of alternative habitats promotes coexistence of an intraguild (IG) predator and prey.
We evaluated predictions of this hypothesis with an experimental introduction of an IG predator fish into four natural stream communities that previously contained only the IG prey fish.
We monitored the development of this IGP over the course of four years to determine how each species used alternative stream habitats.
The introduced species preferred pool habitats while the resident species was more evenly distributed across pools and riffles.
The density of the resident decreased in the pool habitat preferred by the invader, accompanied by a local increase in the mean of the resident size distribution.
Selective predation by the invader on hatchling residents appears to impact the residents' demographic response.
The continued recruitment of resident juveniles in riffles, where the introduced species is rare, facilitated the persistence of the resident.
This differential use of habitats was not accompanied by a change in the resident's growth rates in either habitat.
Our results showed that differential habitat selection and recruitment promoted persistence during an invasion involving IGP, which helps to bridge the gap between theory and observation in explaining coexistence in IGP systems.

Wildlife habitats in general must provide foraging, hiding and resting places as well as sites for reproduction.
Little is known about habitat selection of black grouse in the lowlands of Central Europe.
We investigated habitat selection of seven radio tagged birds in an open heath and grassland area surrounded by dense pine forests in the northern German Lüneburg Heath Nature Reserve.
This site carries one of the last remaining populations in the Central European lowlands.
Using resource selection functions based on presence/background data, we estimated the probability of black grouse occurrence by availability of, or distance to habitat types as well as vegetation diversity indices.
Black grouse preferred undisturbed and heterogeneous habitats far from dense forests with wide sand heaths, natural grasslands and intermixed bogs, diverse vegetation and food sources, low density of (loose) shrub formations and solitary trees.
Wetlands were extremely important in a landscape that is dominated by dry heaths and grasslands.
About 4% (9 km2) of the nature reserve was a suitable habitat for black grouse, mostly due to lack of open areas due to the amount of dense forest, and because smaller, open heaths are only partly suitable.
We suggest that to improve habitat quality and quantity for the grouse, habitat patch size and connectivity must be increased, along with a mosaic of heterogeneous landscape structures in these habitat islands.
Our results may be used to inform and improve black grouse habitat management in the region and elsewhere.

A review of the impacts of four identified major human disturbances on the habitat and habitat use of wild giant pandas from 2015 to 2020.

Human disturbance poses a serious threat to the survival of the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), but few systematic and specialized reviews on the impacts of human disturbance on pandas and their habitats have been published.
After the fourth giant panda survey (2011-2014), some new studies and important findings have emerged.
To update the understanding of the impacts of human disturbance, research on the impacts of major human disturbances on the habitat and habitat use of wild giant pandas from 2015 to 2020 was reviewed based on 33 publications (including three books and 30 articles).
The major human disturbances in panda habitat included livestock grazing, roads, herb collection, and logging.
Livestock affects panda habitat by occupying, disturbing, and defecating in it, and the time and intensity of habitat use by horses are greater than the time and intensity at which pandas use their habitats.
Roads affect nearby habitats by disturbing the vegetation and causing pollution, and the effect of roads extends far beyond the roads themselves and varies with road type.
The impacts of logging on the forest structure and bamboo in panda habitat are long-term.
Pandas avoid habitats disturbed by livestock grazing, roads, and logging.
The impacts of herb collection are not known, because they have received little attention.
Findings suggested a need for further research on human disturbance to giant pandas, focusing on comprehensive evaluations of the interactions between different disturbances.

Structurally complex habitats, such as mangrove forests, allow for rich assemblages of species that benefit from the provided space, volume and substrate.
Changes in habitat complexity can affect species abundance, diversity and resilience.
In this study, we explored the effects of habitat complexity on food web networks in four developmental stages of mangrove forests with differing structural complexities: climax > degrading > colonizing > bare, by analyzing food web structure, stable isotopes and habitat complexity.
We found that food webs became gradually more biodiverse (species richness: +119 %), complex (link density: +39 %), and robust (connectance: -35
%) in climax versus bare stages with increasing complexity of the mangrove forest (i.e., number of trees, leaf cover, and pneumatophore densities).
This study shows that habitat complexity drives food web network structure in dynamic mangrove forests.
We recommend restoration practitioners to use this food web network approach to quantify habitat restoration successes complementary to traditional biodiversity metrics.

Habitat loss is one of the key drivers of the ongoing decline of biodiversity.
However, ecologists still argue about how fragmentation of habitat (independent of habitat loss) affects species richness.
The recently proposed habitat amount hypothesis posits that species richness only depends on the total amount of habitat in a local landscape.
In contrast, empirical studies report contrasting patterns: some find positive and others negative effects of fragmentation per se on species richness.
To explain this apparent disparity, we devise a stochastic, spatially explicit model of competitive species communities in heterogeneous habitats.
The model shows that habitat loss and fragmentation have complex effects on species diversity in competitive communities.
When the total amount of habitat is large, fragmentation per se tends to increase species diversity, but if the total amount of habitat is small, the situation is reversed: fragmentation per se decreases species diversity.

More studies are needed on the mechanism and effective prediction of bird diversity in various habitats.
The primary purpose of this study was to explore the difference in the species richness and evenness of various habitats.
The secondary purpose was to explore which habitat types and compositions predict a high bird diversity.
The 2010-2016 Taiwan Breeding Bird Survey was used to analyze the relationship between landscape habitat and bird ecology.
Landscape habitat type was divided into seven categories and 26 sub-types: forestland, farmland, grassland, freshwater wetland, aquaculture pond and saltpan, coastland, and building area.
Four ecological indexes were used: the number of bird individuals, the number of species, the Margalef Richness Index, and the Pielou Evenness Index.
The result indicated that forestland decreased bird numbers, except in a windbreak forest.
Natural and farmland-related habitats increased bird species richness.
Similarly, the natural habitat increased species evenness.
Urban greenspace could not replace the effect of forestland on species richness and evenness.
Conifer forest, bamboo forest, windbreak forest, mixed tree, tall grassland, and orchard were important habitats for promoting higher species richness and evenness.

Characterizing benthic habitat sensitivities of rapidly-developing countries is of paramount importance.
Recent efforts defining the benthic habitat of Qatar's coastal zone with a high-resolution, ground-truthed benthic habitat map has provided a framework on which to develop a habitat sensitivity map.
Here we present a sensitivity analysis catered towards identifying habitats with varying sensitivities to natural and anthropogenic stressors on a quantitative scale from 1 to 5, low to high.
We have identified that the majority of the coastal area is low risk habitat (i.e. sandflats).
However, there are six areas which are assigned as high risk by virtue of their rich occurrences of seagrass meadows, mangrove forests, and coral reefs -
[1].
The reefs offshore of Al Zubarah on the west coast of the peninsula; [2] The Al Ruwais fringing reef on the northern tip of the peninsula;
[3] The east-coast bays of Al Khor and Al Dhakira; [4] The shore-attached reef complex off Mesaieed (east coast);

This article explores recent research initially driven by interest in studying the "Blue" Habitat of Urban and Suburban Areas (BHUS), focusing on water-related ecosystems.
BHUS, encompassing a wide range of aquatic habitats, is crucial to ecosystem health but is increasingly threatened by biodiversity loss resulting from climate change, land-use expansion, and unsustainable practices.
Through a scoping review of 93 peer-reviewed studies, this article establishes a framework to classify BHUS types, identify target species, and analyze diverse and latest techniques in water system research.
The main themes for studying biodiversity and environmental aspects of these blue habitats are highlighted, along with the urgent need to address BHUS in urban biodiversity conservation.
Findings reveal that water systems are biologically rich but present unique research challenges due to their variability and dynamic, interconnected nature.
While there is growing recognition of the need to consider human influence, many studies overlook the complex, adaptive nature of BHUS as an integrated system.
The article gives insight into establishing a comprehensive framework and integrating diverse methodologies and technologies for specialized research of the BHUS biodiversity, emphasizing the role of advancing technologies and interdisciplinary collaboration between urbanism and ecology.
These approaches are essential to support sustainable development that addresses conservation needs and mitigates urbanization's impacts on BHUS.
Further research should explore how spatial planning and strategies can more effectively integrate blue habitats to strengthen biodiversity conservation within the global urbanization context.

Understanding factors that drive biodiversity distributions is central in ecology and critical to conservation.
Elevational gradients are useful for studying the effects of climate on biodiversity but it can be difficult to disentangle climate effects from resource differences among habitat types.
Here we compare elevational patterns and influences of environmental variables on ground-dwelling arthropods in open- and forested-habitats.
We examine these comparisons in three arthropod functional groups (detritivores, predators, and herbivores) and two taxonomic groups (beetles and arachnids).
We sampled twelve sites spanning 1,132 m elevation and four life zones, collecting 4,834 individual ground arthropods identified to 123 taxa.
Elevation was a strong predicator for arthropod composition, however, patterns differed among functional and taxonomic groups and individual species between open- and forested-habitats.
Beetles, arachnids, and predators decreased with elevation in open habitats but increased in forests showing a significant interaction between habitat type and elevation.
Detritivores and herbivores showed no elevational patterns.
We found 11 arthropod taxa with linear elevational patterns, seven that peaked in abundance at high elevations, and four taxa at low elevations.
We also found eight taxa with parabolic elevational patterns that peaked in abundance at mid-elevations.
We found that vegetation composition and productivity had stronger explanatory power for arthropod composition in forested habitats, while ground cover was a stronger predictor in open habitats.
Temperature and precipitation were important in both habitats.
Our findings demonstrate that relationships between animal diversity and elevation can be mediated by habitat type, suggesting that physiological restraints and resource limitations work differently between habitat types.

While many efforts have been devoted to understand variations in food web structure among terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, the environmental factors influencing food web structure at large spatial scales remain hardly explored.
Here, we compiled biodiversity inventories to infer food web structure of 67 French lakes using an allometric niche-based model and tested how environmental variables (temperature, productivity, and habitat) influence them.
By applying a multivariate analysis on 20 metrics of food web topology, we found that food web structural variations are represented by two distinct complementary and independent structural descriptors.
The first is related to the overall trophic diversity, whereas the second is related to the vertical structure.
Interestingly, the trophic diversity descriptor was mostly explained by habitat size (26.7% of total deviance explained) and habitat complexity (20.1%) followed by productivity (dissolved organic carbon: 16.4%; nitrate: 9.1%) and thermal variations (10.7%).
Regarding the vertical structure descriptor, it was mostly explained by water thermal seasonality (39.0% of total deviance explained) and habitat depth (31.9%) followed by habitat complexity (8.5%) and size (5.5%) as well as annual mean temperature (5.6%).
Overall, we found that temperature, productivity, and habitat characteristics collectively shape lake food web structure.
We also found that intermediate levels of productivity, high levels of temperature (mean and seasonality), as well as large habitats are associated with the largest and most complex food webs.
Our findings, therefore, highlight the importance of focusing on these three components especially in the context of global change, as significant structural changes in aquatic food webs could be expected under increased temperature, pollution, and habitat alterations.

Human activities are altering the structure of ecological communities, often favouring generalists over specialists.
For reef fishes, increasingly degraded habitats and climate-driven range shifts may independently augment generalization, particularly if fishes with least-specific habitat requirements are more likely to shift geographic ranges to track their thermal niche.
Using a unique global dataset on temperate and tropical reef fishes and habitat composition, we calculated a species generalization index that empirically estimates the habitat niche breadth of each fish species.
We then applied the species generalization index to evaluate potential impacts of habitat loss and range shifts across large scales, on coral and rocky reefs.
Our analyses revealed consistent habitat-induced shifts in community structure that favoured generalist fishes following regional coral mortality events and between adjacent sea urchin barrens and kelp habitats.
Analysis of the distribution of tropical fishes also identified the species generalization index as the most important trait in predicting their poleward range extent, more so than body or range size.
Generalist tropical reef fishes penetrate further into subtropical and temperate zones than specialists.
Dynamic responses of reef fishes to habitat degradation imply loss of specialists at local scales, while generalists will be broadly favoured under intensifying anthropogenic pressures.
An increased focus on individual requirements of specialists could provide useful guidance for species threat assessments and conservation actions, while ecosystem and multi-species fisheries models should recognize increasing prevalence of generalists.

Conservation, restoration and land management are increasingly implemented at landscape scales1,2.
However, because species interaction data are typically habitat- and/or guild-specific, exactly how those interactions connect habitats and affect the stability and function of communities at landscape scales remains poorly understood.
We combine multi-guild species interaction data (plant-pollinator and three plant-herbivore-parasitoid communities, collected from landscapes with one, two or three habitats), a field experiment and a modelling approach to show that multi-habitat landscapes support higher species and interaction evenness, more complementary species interactions and more consistent robustness to species loss.
These emergent network properties drive improved pollination success in landscapes with more habitats and are not explained by simply summing component habitat webs.
Linking landscape composition, through community structure, to ecosystem function, highlights mechanisms by which several contiguous habitats can support landscape-scale ecosystem services.

Addressing the ongoing biodiversity crisis requires identifying the winners and losers of global change.
Species are often categorized based on how they respond to habitat loss; for example, species restricted to natural environments, those that most often occur in anthropogenic habitats, and generalists that do well in both.
However, species might switch habitat affiliations across time and space: an organism may venture into human-modified areas in benign regions but retreat into thermally buffered forested habitats in areas with high temperatures.
Here, we apply community occupancy models to a large-scale camera trapping dataset with 29 mammal species distributed over 2,485 sites across the continental United States, to ask three questions.
First, are species' responses to forest and anthropogenic habitats consistent across continental scales?
Second, do macroclimatic conditions explain spatial variation in species responses to land use?
Third, can species traits elucidate which taxa are most likely to show climate-dependent habitat associations?
We found that all species exhibited significant spatial variation in how they respond to land-use, tending to avoid anthropogenic areas and increasingly use forests in hotter regions.
In the hottest regions, species occupancy was 50% higher in forested compared to open habitats, whereas in the coldest regions, the trend reversed.
Larger species with larger ranges, herbivores, and primary predators were more likely to change their habitat affiliations than top predators, which consistently affiliated with high forest cover.
Our findings suggest that climatic conditions influence species' space-use and that maintaining forest cover can help protect mammals from warming climates.

Understanding large-scale drivers of biodiversity in palustrine wetlands is challenging due to the combined effects of macroclimate and local edaphic conditions.
In boreal and temperate fen ecosystems, the influence of macroclimate on biodiversity is modulated by hydrological settings across habitats, making it difficult to assess their vulnerability to climate change.
Here, we investigate the influence of macroclimate and edaphic factors on three Essential Biodiversity Variables across eight ecologically defined habitats that align with ecosystem classifications and red lists.
We used 27,555 vegetation plot samples from European fens to assess the influence of macroclimate and groundwater pH predictors on the geographic distribution of each habitat type.
Additionally, we modeled the relative influence of macroclimate, water pH, and water table depth on community species richness and composition, focusing on 309 plant specialists.
Our models reveal strong effects of mean annual temperature, diurnal thermal range, and summer temperature on biodiversity variables, with contrasting differences among habitats.
While macroclimatic factors primarily shape geographic distributions and species richness, edaphic factors emerge as the primary drivers of composition for vascular plants and bryophytes.
Annual precipitation exhibits non-linear effects on fen biodiversity, with varying impact across habitats with different hydrological characteristics, suggesting a minimum requirement of 600 mm of annual precipitation for the occurrence of fen ecosystems.
Our results anticipate potential impacts of climate warming on European fens, with predictable changes among habitat types and geographic regions.
Moreover, we provide evidence that the drivers of biodiversity in boreal and temperate fens are closely tied to the ecological characteristics of each habitat type and the dispersal abilities of bryophytes and vascular plants.
Given that the influence of macroclimate and edaphic factors on fen ecosystems is habitat specific, climate change research and conservation actions should consider ecological differentiation within functional IUCN ecosystems at continental and regional scales.
