PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Biodiversity underpins urban ecosystem functions that are essential for human health and well-being.
Understanding how biodiversity relates to human health is a developing frontier for science, policy and practice.
This article describes the beneficial, as well as harmful, aspects of biodiversity to human health in urban environments.
RECENT FINDINGS:
Recent research shows that contact with biodiversity of natural environments within towns and cities can be both positive and negative to human physical, mental and social health and well-being.
For example, while viruses or pollen can be seriously harmful to human health, biodiverse ecosystems can promote positive health and well-being.
On balance, these influences are positive.
As biodiversity is declining at an unprecedented rate, research suggests that its loss could threaten the quality of life of all humans.
A key research gap is to understand-and evidence-the specific causal pathways through which biodiversity affects human health.
A mechanistic understanding of pathways linking biodiversity to human health can facilitate the application of nature-based solutions in public health and influence policy.
Research integration as well as cross-sector urban policy and planning development should harness opportunities to better identify linkages between biodiversity, climate and human health.
Given its importance for human health, urban biodiversity conservation should be considered as public health investment.

Soil is an immense habitat for diverse organisms across the tree of life, but just how many organisms live in soil is surprisingly unknown.
Previous efforts to enumerate soil biodiversity consider only certain types of organisms (e.g., animals) or report values for diverse groups without partitioning species that live in soil versus other habitats.
Here, we reviewed the biodiversity literature to show that soil is likely home to 59 ± 15% of the species on Earth.
We therefore estimate an approximately two times greater soil biodiversity than previous estimates, and we include representatives from the simplest (microbial) to most complex (mammals) organisms.
Enchytraeidae have the greatest percentage of species in soil (98.6%), followed by fungi (90%), Plantae (85.5%), and Isoptera (84.2%).
Our results demonstrate that soil is the most biodiverse singular habitat.
By using this estimate of soil biodiversity, we can more accurately and quantitatively advocate for soil organismal conservation and restoration as a central goal of the Anthropocene.

The diversity of microbial ecosystems is linked to crucial ecological processes and functions.
Despite its significance, the ecological mechanisms responsible for the initiation and maintenance of microbiome diversity are still not fully understood.
The primary challenge lies in the difficulty of isolating, monitoring, and manipulating the complex and interrelated ecological processes that modulate the diversity of microbial communities in their natural habitats.
Synthetic ecology experiments provide a suitable alternative for investigating the mechanisms behind microbial biodiversity in controlled laboratory settings, as the environment can be systematically and modularly manipulated by adding and removing components.
This enables the testing of hypotheses and the advancement of predictive theories.
In this review, we present an overview of recent progress toward achieving this goal.

A biodiversity hypothesis.
Author information: (1)Skin and Allergy Hospital, Helsinki University Hospital, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.
Biodiversity hypothesis states that contact with natural environments enriches the human microbiome, promotes immune balance and protects from allergy and inflammatory disorders.
We are protected by two nested layers of biodiversity, microbiota of the outer layer (soil, natural waters, plants, animals) and inner layer (gut, skin, airways).
The latter inhabits our body and is colonized from the outer layer.
Explosion of human populations along with cultural evolution is profoundly changing our environment and lifestyle.
Adaptive immunoregulatory circuits and dynamic homeostasis are at stake in the newly emerged urban surroundings.
In allergy, and chronic inflammatory disorders in general, exploring the determinants of immunotolerance is the key for prevention and more effective treatment.
Loss of immunoprotective factors, derived from nature, is a new kind of health risk poorly acknowledged until recently.
The paradigm change has been implemented in the Finnish allergy programme (2008-2018), which emphasized tolerance instead of avoidance.
The first results are promising, as allergy burden has started to reduce.
The rapidly urbanizing world is facing serious biodiversity loss with global warming, which are interconnected.
Biodiversity hypothesis of health and disease has societal impact, for example, on city planning, food and energy production and nature conservation.
It has also a message for individuals for health and well-being: take nature close, to touch, eat, breathe, experience and enjoy.
Biodiverse natural environments are dependent on planetary health, which should be a priority also among health professionals.

The biodiversity hypothesis postulates that the natural environment positively affects human physical and mental health.
We evaluate the latest evidence and propose new tools to examine the halobiont environment.
We chose to target our review at neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, autism, dementia, multiple sclerosis, etc. because a green prescription (exposure to green spaces) was shown to benefit patients with neuropsychiatric disorders.
Specifically, our review consists of three mini reviews on the associations exploring: (1) ecological biodiversity and human microbiota; (2) human microbiota and neuropsychiatric disorders; (3) ecological biodiversity and neuropsychiatric disorders.
We conclude that the environment could directly transfer microbes to humans and that human studies support the gut microbiota as part of the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders.
Overall, the results from the three mini reviews consistently support the biodiversity hypothesis.
These findings demonstrated the plausibility of biodiversity exerting mental health effects through biophysiological mechanisms instead of psychological mechanisms alone.
The idea can be further tested with novel biodiversity measurements and research on the effects of a green prescription.

Soil is one of the most biodiverse terrestrial habitats.
Yet, we lack an integrative conceptual framework for understanding the patterns and mechanisms driving soil biodiversity.
One of the underlying reasons for our poor understanding of soil biodiversity patterns relates to whether key biodiversity theories (historically developed for aboveground and aquatic organisms) are applicable to patterns of soil biodiversity.
Here, we present a systematic literature review to investigate whether and how key biodiversity theories (species-energy relationship, theory of island biogeography, metacommunity theory, niche theory and neutral theory) can explain observed patterns of soil biodiversity.
We then discuss two spatial compartments nested within soil at which biodiversity theories can be applied to acknowledge the scale-dependent nature of soil biodiversity.

Mountain regions are unusually biodiverse, with rich aggregations of small-ranged species that form centers of endemism.
Mountains play an array of roles for Earth's biodiversity and affect neighboring lowlands through biotic interchange, changes in regional climate, and nutrient runoff.
The high biodiversity of certain mountains reflects the interplay of multiple evolutionary mechanisms: enhanced speciation rates with distinct opportunities for coexistence and persistence of lineages, shaped by long-term climatic changes interacting with topographically dynamic landscapes.
High diversity in most tropical mountains is tightly linked to bedrock geology-notably, areas comprising mafic and ultramafic lithologies, rock types rich in magnesium and poor in phosphate that present special requirements for plant physiology.
Mountain biodiversity bears the signature of deep-time evolutionary and ecological processes, a history well worth preserving.

Of all ecosystems, freshwaters support the most dynamic and highly concentrated biodiversity on Earth.
These attributes of freshwater biodiversity along with increasing demand for water mean that these systems serve as significant models to understand drivers of global biodiversity change.
Freshwater biodiversity changes are often attributed to hydrological alteration by water-resource development and climate change owing to the role of the hydrological regime of rivers, wetlands and floodplains affecting patterns of biodiversity.
However, a major gap remains in conceptualising how the hydrological regime determines patterns in biodiversity's multiple spatial components and facets (taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic).
We synthesised primary evidence of freshwater biodiversity responses to natural hydrological regimes to determine how distinct ecohydrological mechanisms affect freshwater biodiversity at local, landscape and regional spatial scales.
Hydrological connectivity influences local and landscape biodiversity, yet responses vary depending on spatial scale.
Biodiversity at local scales is generally positively associated with increasing connectivity whereas landscape-scale biodiversity is greater with increasing fragmentation among locations.
The effects of hydrological disturbance on freshwater biodiversity are variable at separate spatial scales and depend on disturbance frequency and history and organism characteristics.
The role of hydrology in determining habitat for freshwater biodiversity also depends on spatial scaling.
At local scales, persistence, stability and size of habitat each contribute to patterns of freshwater biodiversity yet the responses are variable across the organism groups that constitute overall freshwater biodiversity.
We present a conceptual model to unite the effects of different ecohydrological mechanisms on freshwater biodiversity across spatial scales, and develop four principles for applying a multi-scaled understanding of freshwater biodiversity responses to hydrological regimes.
The protection and restoration of freshwater biodiversity is both a fundamental justification and a central goal of environmental water allocation worldwide.
Clearer integration of concepts of spatial scaling in the context of understanding impacts of hydrological regimes on biodiversity will increase uptake of evidence into environmental flow implementation, identify suitable biodiversity targets responsive to hydrological change or restoration, and identify and manage risks of environmental flows contributing to biodiversity decline.

Biodiversity's contribution to human welfare has become a key argument for maintaining and enhancing biodiversity in managed ecosystems.
The functional relationship between biodiversity (b) and economic value (V) is, however, insufficiently understood, despite the premise of a positive-concave bV relationship that dominates scientific and political arenas.
Here, we review how individual links between biodiversity, ecosystem functions (F), and services affect resulting bV relationships.
Our findings show that bV relationships are more variable, also taking negative-concave/convex or strictly concave and convex forms.
This functional form is driven not only by the underlying bF relationship but also by the number and type of ecosystem services and their potential trade-offs considered, the effects of inputs, and the type of utility function used to represent human preferences.
Explicitly accounting for these aspects will enhance the substance and coverage of future valuation studies and allow more nuanced conclusions, particularly for managed ecosystems.

The world's biomes and their associated ecosystems are artificially fractured by geopolitical boundaries that define countries.
Yet 'transboundary' landscapes often overlap with biodiversity hotspots, contain surprisingly important ecosystems, and provide critical habitats for threatened species.
Notwithstanding, biodiversity in these landscapes is increasingly imperiled by infrastructure, including walls and fences along borders and cross-border roads that drive landscape fragmentation and the loss of ecological connectivity.
Associated problems due to reduced governance (e.g., illegal wildlife trade) also undermine conservation efforts in these important regions.
In this review, we distinguish positive and negative effects of transboundary frontiers on biodiversity conservation, discuss lessons from existing frameworks, and identify scenarios that can maximize opportunities for biodiversity conservation in transboundary frontiers.

Delimiting and naming biodiversity is a vital step toward wildlife conservation and research.
However, species delimitation must be consistent across biota so that the limited resources available for nature protection can be spent effectively and objectively.
To date, newly discovered lineages typically are either left undescribed and thus remain unprotected or are being erroneously proposed as new species despite mixed evidence for completed speciation, in turn contributing to the emerging problem of taxonomic inflation.
Inspired by recent conceptual and methodological progress, we propose a standardized workflow for species delimitation that combines phylogenetic and hybrid zone analyses of genomic datasets ("genomic taxonomy"), in which phylogeographic lineages that do not freely admix are ranked as species, while those that have remained fully genetically compatible are ranked as subspecies.
In both cases, we encourage their formal taxonomic naming, diagnosis, and description to promote social awareness toward biodiversity.
The use of loci throughout the genome overcomes the unreliability of widely used barcoding genes when phylogeographic patterns are complex, while the evaluation of divergence and reproductive isolation unifies the long-opposed concepts of lineage species and biological species.
We suggest that a shift in conservation assessments from a single level (species) toward a two-level hierarchy (species and subspecies) will lead to a more balanced perception of biodiversity in which both intraspecific and interspecific diversity are valued and more adequately protected.

Meeting the ever-increasing needs of the Earth's human population without excessively reducing biological diversity is one of the greatest challenges facing humanity, suggesting that new approaches to biodiversity conservation are required.
One idea rapidly gaining momentum-as well as opposition-is to incorporate the values of biodiversity into decision-making using economic methods.
Here, we develop several lines of argument for how biodiversity might be valued, building on recent developments in natural science, economics and science-policy processes.
Then we provide a synoptic guide to the papers in this special feature, summarizing recent research advances relevant to biodiversity valuation and management.
Current evidence suggests that more biodiverse systems have greater stability and resilience, and that by maximizing key components of biodiversity we maximize an ecosystem's long-term value.
Moreover, many services and values arising from biodiversity are interdependent, and often poorly captured by standard economic models.
We conclude that economic valuation approaches to biodiversity conservation should (i) account for interdependency and (ii) complement rather than replace traditional approaches.
To identify possible solutions, we present a framework for understanding the foundational role of hard-to-quantify 'biodiversity services' in sustaining the value of ecosystems to humanity, and then use this framework to highlight new directions for pure and applied research.
In most cases, clarifying the links between biodiversity and ecosystem services, and developing effective policy and practice for managing biodiversity, will require a genuinely interdisciplinary approach.

Fungi represent a large proportion of the genetic diversity on Earth and fungal activity influences the structure of plant and animal communities, as well as rates of ecosystem processes.
Large-scale DNA-sequencing datasets are beginning to reveal the dimensions of fungal biodiversity, which seem to be fundamentally different to bacteria, plants and animals.
In this Review, we describe the patterns of fungal biodiversity that have been revealed by molecular-based studies.
Furthermore, we consider the evidence that supports the roles of different candidate drivers of fungal diversity at a range of spatial scales, as well as the role of dispersal limitation in maintaining regional endemism and influencing local community assembly.
Finally, we discuss the ecological mechanisms that are likely to be responsible for the high heterogeneity that is observed in fungal communities at local scales.

Population genetic data underpin many studies of behavioral, ecological, and evolutionary processes in wild populations and contribute to effective conservation management.
However, collecting genetic samples can be challenging when working with endangered, invasive, or cryptic species.
Environmental DNA (eDNA) offers a way to sample genetic material non-invasively without requiring visual observation.
While eDNA has been trialed extensively as a biodiversity and biosecurity monitoring tool with a strong taxonomic focus, it has yet to be fully explored as a means for obtaining population genetic information.
Here, we review current research that employs eDNA approaches for the study of populations.
We outline challenges facing eDNA-based population genetic methodologies, and suggest avenues of research for future developments.
We advocate that with further optimizations, this emergent field holds great potential as part of the population genetics toolkit.

As most life-forms exist as holobionts, reduction of host-level biodiversity drives parallel habitat losses to their host-adapted microorganisms.
The holobiont concept helps us to understand how species are habitats for - often ignored - coevolved microorganisms also worthy of conservation.
Indeed, loss of host-associated microbial biodiversity may accelerate the extinction risks of their host.

Increasing human pressure threatens plant and animal species with extinction worldwide.
National political institutions constitute an important arena for biodiversity conservation.
Yet, the relationship between how democratic these national institutions are and a country's efforts towards and track-record for biodiversity conservation remains poorly understood.
In this review, we outline the theoretical links between democracy and biodiversity conservation and review the empirical literature testing them.
While more studies reported a positive than a negative relation between democracy and biodiversity conservation (15 vs. 11), the most common result was a mixed relationship (28), often conditioned on economic factors.
The use of different proxies to measure biodiversity, including deforestation, protected areas, threatened species, and fishery statistics emerged as a primary obstacle for synthesis.
We suggest overcoming this caveat together with a consistent definition of democratic institutions and a standardized statistical framework as research priorities to improve policies against the global biodiversity loss.

Given the fundamental role played by the intestinal microbial community in influencing host health, it is not surprising that recent decades have been marked by increased efforts to determine the taxonomic composition of the human gut microbiota and its associated functions.
Despite their generally accepted importance, these large-scale human-centered studies prevent an exhaustive overview of those mechanisms and factors that contribute to the mammalian gut microbiota assembly.
However, Next-Generation Sequencing techniques and associated bioinformatic tools provide an exciting opportunity to rapidly expand our knowledge on the intestinal microbial communities associated with members of the Mammalia class.
These non-human-focused studies established that dietary, host phylogeny, host physiology and anthropogenic influences represent the main factors driving the selection of a specific gut microbial consortium in mammals.
The current review is aimed at providing a comprehensive overview on the impact that the above-mentioned factors exert on the assembly of the mammalian gut microbiota.

A multitude of actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural and modified ecosystems can have co-benefits for both climate mitigation and biodiversity conservation.
Reducing greenhouse emissions to limit warming to less than 1.5 or 2°C above preindustrial levels, as outlined in the Paris Agreement, can yield strong co-benefits for land, freshwater and marine biodiversity and reduce amplifying climate feedbacks from ecosystem changes.
Not all climate mitigation strategies are equally effective at producing biodiversity co-benefits, some in fact are counterproductive.
Moreover, social implications are often overlooked within the climate-biodiversity nexus.
Protecting biodiverse and carbon-rich natural environments, ecological restoration of potentially biodiverse and carbon-rich habitats, the deliberate creation of novel habitats, taking into consideration a locally adapted and meaningful (i.e. full consequences considered) mix of these measures, can result in the most robust win-win solutions.
These can be further enhanced by avoidance of narrow goals, taking long-term views and minimizing further losses of intact ecosystems.
In this review paper, we first discuss various climate mitigation actions that evidence demonstrates can negatively impact biodiversity, resulting in unseen and unintended negative consequences.
We then examine climate mitigation actions that co-deliver biodiversity and societal benefits.
We give examples of these win-win solutions, categorized as 'protect, restore, manage and create', in different regions of the world that could be expanded, upscaled and used for further innovation.
