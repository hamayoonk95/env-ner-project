    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Project Background\n",
    "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in natural language processing that involves identifying and classifying entities such as names of people, organisations, places, or domain-specific concepts within unstructured text. While general-purpose NER models have shown strong performance on benchmark datasets such as CoNLL-2003, their effectiveness decreases when applied to specialised scientific domains. One such domain is environmental science, where named entities often include rare species, chemical compounds, geographical locations, ecological processes, and other scientific terminology not well represented in mainstream corpora.\n",
    "\n",
    "The application of NER in environmental science has several use cases. These include extracting structured metadata from research papers, supporting environmental knowledge bases, improving search tools for scientific datasets, and automating the indexing of documents in large-scale data repositories. However, the lack of labelled corpora in this domain limits the development of high-quality NER systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is the first part of a broader pipeline developed to create a domain-specific NER dataset for environmental science. It focuses on collecting, cleaning, and segmenting unlabelled raw text from multiple sources, including research data catalogues, scientific abstracts, and environmental news articles. This forms the foundational input for downstream steps such as vocabulary generation, weak supervision, annotation, and model training. Each subsequent phase is handled in separate notebooks that build on the outputs from this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. Challenges of NER in Environmental Domain\n",
    "The task of recognising named entities in environmental science presents several unique challenges that distinguish it from more commonly studied domains such as finance or news media.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, there is a significant lack of annotated data. Unlike biomedical NLP, which benefits from large labelled corpora like GENIA or BC5CDR, the environmental domain has no established NER datasets of comparable scale or quality. This makes supervised training difficult and requires domain-specific data collection and annotation from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, environmental text contains a high proportion of domain-specific and often rare terminology. These include Latin taxonomic names, technical habitat descriptors, pollutants, and process-related terms that are unlikely to appear in generic training data. Many of these terms are long, nested, or ambiguous in structure, making entity boundary detection more difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, the structure and writing style of source material varies widely. Environmental content may come from formal research articles, semi-structured metadata catalogues, government reports, or plain-language news pieces. These sources differ in sentence complexity, formatting, and vocabulary, which presents challenges for both sentence segmentation and downstream entity recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, named entity categories in this domain often overlap or require fine-grained distinctions. For example, a species name may also refer to a habitat or a threat classification. Similarly, physical quantities and measurements often co-occur with entity mentions, complicating span detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "These challenges underline the need for a domain-adapted pipeline that begins with high-quality, representative data collection and preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3. Objectives\n",
    "This notebook focuses on preparing unlabelled environmental text for use in a domain-specific NER pipeline. The main objectives are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* To gather raw text data from three representative sources: the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH) Data Catalogue, PubMed abstracts relevant to environmental science, and an environment-tagged news corpus from Kaggle.\n",
    "* To clean the text by removing unwanted characters, correcting encoding issues, and flattening inconsistent formatting, particularly in scientific abstracts and metadata descriptions.\n",
    "* To perform sentence segmentation using a spaCy-based NLP pipeline, standardising the structure of the dataset across sources.\n",
    "* To carry out quality checks on the segmented sentences, including length distributions, random samples, and validation of data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps ensure that the resulting text is well-formed and ready for the generation of entity vocabularies and annotation tasks in the next stage of the pipeline."

    "## 2. Data Collection Overview\n",
    "To support the training of a domain-specific Named Entity Recognition (NER) model, raw text was collected from three environmentally focused sources. Each source offers a distinct combination of writing style, vocabulary, and domain specificity. This diversity is intended to improve the model’s ability to generalise across formal scientific publications, institutional metadata, and public-facing texts.\n",

    "The raw text collected from UKCEH documents, PubMed abstracts, and Kaggle news articles contains several inconsistencies that require light preprocessing before sentence segmentation and annotation. These include formatting artefacts, broken lines, bullet symbols, and occasional encoding issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text from the UKCEH source requires particular attention. Many of the supporting documents were extracted from scanned PDFs using OCR, which introduces broken encodings, repeated spacing, and stray Unicode characters. Light preprocessing is needed to make this content structurally consistent with the other sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing is applied conservatively to preserve the original surface forms of entities. No transformations are performed that would affect capitalisation, token structure, or grammar.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following types of issues were observed during manual inspection:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bullet characters (e.g. `•`, `▪`, `►`) at the start of lines\n",
    "- Section labels or figure references (e.g. `Table 1`, `Appendix A`)\n",
    "- Broken Unicode symbols or non-standard characters\n",
    "- Line breaks splitting logical sentences across multiple lines (especially in PubMed)\n",

    "- **Lowercasing** is avoided because many entity types (e.g. species names, locations, chemical compounds) rely on capitalisation to be correctly identified.\n",
    "- **Stopword removal** is not applied since some entities contain common stopwords (e.g. *River of Life*, *Department of the Environment*).\n",
    "- **Stemming or lemmatisation** may distort entity boundaries and forms, reducing the reliability of span-based annotation.\n",

This should attempt to reduce the amount of travelling as far as possible but must also take accommodation problems into account (i.e. it may be more efficient to survey several sites from the same base, rather than moving to get slightly nearer), any arrangements with Regional Staff and access permission if this is limited to specified dates. I  You will be supplied with a full set of field equipment including all the necessary maps, recording sheets and other ancillary equipment before leaving Merl ewood. A check list of all equipment is given in Appendix VI. F  Woods will be located using road maps, 1\" Ordnance Survey and the 23\" site maps as required. Having located the site the first important thing is obtaining PERMISSION to enter and survey the site in question.  é  Access _and Permission to Survey Sites  You will be given advanced information about all your sites which will indicate whether or not you are solely responsible for obtaining permission. In certain cases the Regional Office will have indicated in advance that special circumstances prevail with regard to access. For example, advance permission may have been obtained by the Regional Office or Merlewood, in which case you can proceed straight on to  carry out the survey. In other cases, it may be necessary to contact Regional Staff or the land-owner himself (in which case all details will be supplied), and all that is necessary here is to Follow rout the instructions.  In other cases the task of obtaining permission to survey the site will be your responsibility. In some instances the owner's name and address may be supplied and you should contact him or her. In other cases there may be several owners, some known, some unknown, and here it will be best to contact one of the owners (probably the one who owns the largest area if this is known) ask his permission and whether any of the others will mind. If he says yes on both counts you may proceed, and, in  the unlikely event of your meeting any of the other owners, you will have to explain the situation. In yet other cases, and these may be in the majority in some areas, ownership of the woods may be a complete blank. In this case the best procedure is to contact the occupants  of the farm or house, if any, which is nearest to the wood, and look  as if they might themselves own it. Ask them if they do own it and  if so, can you have permission to carry out your survey. If they do not own it ask who does. If they know, it may be possible to ask if the owner would mind (this may be particularly useful if the owner does not live locally). If the real owner does live locally, it will be best  to carry on to ask his permission direct. 2 x In general, all that is required is common sense and tact. Ery and appreciate the owners problems; he may have fences and walls which he fears will get damaged; he may be raising game birds; he may just like his privacy and so on. If you meet with great reluctance or a blank refusal withdraw politely explaining that we have a list of alternative back-up sites which can be used if they would prefer not to allow access to their wood. If an owner gives you permission, as in our experience the vast majority will, ask him if there are areas he would like you to avoid or any precautions he would like you to take.  You will be provided with a brief written description of what the  survey is about. If the owner, or anybody you come into contact with, asks you what it.is all for, let him read this slip and try and answer any questions as best you can. If things get tricky  offer to find out the answer for him or refer him direct to Merlewood.  Good public relations are an extremely important facet of the Nature Conservancy's work. If you upset anybody with whom you come into contact, the Regional Staff, in whose area you are working will be the ones who have to deal with the repercussions. Above all, make it quite clear the Nature Conservancy is not surveying their wood with a view to purchasing it. Some owners may fear compulsory purchase, a power which the Nature Conservancy holds (but has never exercised), or some other lesser interference with their ownership and enjoyment of the site. In the case of the present survey, nothing could be further removed from the intent, although it is of course remotely possible that the survey might turn up a few new sites which would be regarded as being of high conservation value. Some of the sites are already notified Sites of Special Scientific Interest, (S.S.S.I.s) or Proposed ~ National Nature Reserves (P.N.N.R»S), in which case the owner will know all about it anyway. ; %  If you are unable to get permission to visit a site or think it unwise to pursue the matter further, you will have to contact Mexrlewood so that you can be supplied with the necessary i on mation (map, sampling points, etc.) for the back-up site. Give a forwarding or poste restante address, and then you can work on other sites until the information is available.  Starting the Survey  Having obtained permission to visit the site the best access point(s) should be determined, as far as possible reducing the walking distance for yourself carrying equipment and samples.  It may, for example, be possible to go to some of the sample points from an access point at one end of the wood and the rest from the other end. Do not, however, upset surrounding owners by flogging across fields or fences just to save a few yards walking. Try and use well marked tracks or footpaths wherever possible; it usually saves time and temper in the long run, and avoids many navigational difficulties. ae Location of the Sampling Points  The 23\" map of the site has 16 random sampling points (numbered 1=16) marked on it and the method of locating these points on the ground is an extremely critical part of the survey procedure upon which much else depends. There are two important factors in the locating of the points:=  (1) Accuracy (2) Absence of subjective bias (i.e. exercising choice)  the latter being far more important than the former, although high accuracy automatically ensures absence of bias. In: practice, high accuracy is not possible without resorting to time consuming methods using survey poles, tapes, compasses etc., and since pin-point accuracy has no intrinsic value, more rapid, primitive methods of locating the points are valid so long as the unbiased nature of the process is not prejudiced. The essential features of the method adopted, and described below, are its predetermined, mechanical characteristics, of which reasonable accuracy is a part. Since certain information about the plots, e.g. altitude, slope position, measures of exposure, etc. will be taken from the map,  a reasonable degree of accuracy is required if site and map collected data are to be compatible. The level of accuracy to be aimed at, and this should be easily obtainable in nearly all circumstances, is to get the sampling point within a 20 m radius of its true location. The following procedure should be followed :-  (a) Decide on the point to be sampled next (they need not be surveyed in numerical order if this is not convenient ).  (b) Look on the map for the nearest point that can be accurately and unmistakeably pin-pointed on the ground {a control point), €.g. a ride intersection, intersection of a wall or stream or a marked change in direction of a fence line etc.  (c) By orientating the map and compass take a bearing from the control point to the sample point, not forgetting to add 9° for magnetic variation.  (d) Using the scale on the side of the compass, measure the distance from the control point to the sample point. On the 24\" = 1 mile scale 1/32nd = 22 yards.  (e) Find the control point on the ground.  (f) Take the correct compass bearing from the control point to the sample point and pace out the correct distance in this direction. Some correction for slope is adviseable if this is more than 20°, as follows:-  20° = + 6%, 25° = + 10%, 30° = + 15%, 35° = + 22%, 40° = + 31%  Keeping accurate paces either up or down steep slopes is difficult and it is best to avoid both this problem and the slope correction oe  &  by choosing a control point at the same height on the slope, if this is possible, and pacing on the level. across the slope (even if it is a bit further than from some other .control point).  (g) Short of endangering one's life, adhere absolutely to the  number of paces that were predetermined, the centre point of the plot being adjacent to the toe of the boot on the forward foot.  Similarly, wandering away from the predetermined direction must be avoided, even at the expense of making life difficult.  Such considerations as, this bit is not very typical\", or, \"we had a bit like this last time, we will walk on another 10 paces, it looks better there\", must be avoided at all costs. Taking short or long paces in order to avoid a blackthorn thicket or nettle bed is an equally serious crime.  Order of Recording the Data  Having located the sample point according to the methods described above, four sets of data (a separate recording form for each) and two sets of Samples have to be collected from each point. A flow chart showing the organisation and division of responsibility for the survey and recording of a site, and the plots therein, is given in Fig. 1.  (a) Ground Flora - presence and absence in five successively ‘increasing quadrat sizes (see details ‘below and Fig. 2) and % cover/abundance estimates for the largest of these. A comprehensive sample of bryophytes is also collected from the full plot.  (b) Trees, saplings and shrubs - trees, D.B.H. (cm) and species being recorded from all four quarters of a 14,14 x 14.14 m plot (200 m2), the same data for saplings and shrubs being collected from a pair of diagonally opposite quarters 1 and 3 (see Fige 2).  (c) Plot description and habitat data - mostly presence and absence of attributes, from the same 14,14 x 14.14.m plot.  (d) Soil data - from a small pit and auger borings taken in the centre of the plot. A composite soil sample from the top 10-15 cm is also obtained at the same time.  These can be obtained in any other order if this is found to be more convenient, except that the (a) ground flora should be | recorded first so that it is not unduly disturbed by the extensive trampling that is usually involved in recording (b) tree,saplings and shrubs and to a lesser extent (d) the soil data.  The methods of laying out the necessary plots and the collecting and recording of the data are now dealt with in detail. Recording of Plot Data (a) Ground Flora  The first operation when the plot centre has been located, is to  lay out the plot. The centre post is stuck firmly in the ground at this point and the right angle gauge on top, spun to give a random orientation to the plot. When this has ceased turning,  the clamping nut is screwed tight to prevent further movement.  The four corner poles now have their distance lines (10 m) clipped into the centre and run out to their full extent in line with the arms of the right angle gauge and stuck into the ground. These corner posts delineate the largest 14.14 x 14.14 m (200 m= ) plot. Spaced along each of the distance strings are four coloured markers which give the half-diagonal distances of the four smaller plots (see Fig. 2). The four short pegs supplied are used to mark the corners of the successively larger plots for 2 x 2 Tl  (4 m@) up to 10 x 10 m (100 m7),  Starting with the smallest 2 x 2 m plot, the area within is carefully searched recording the presence of all ground flora species = all vascular plants (monocots., dicots. and ferns) - including tree or shrub seedlings <25 cm in height. The species names (or the abbreviation thereof as used on a B.SeBole card)  are entered in the wide column under the appropriate quadrat size. Assigned names which are specified in the herbarium (see Appendix I) can also be used.  NoBo It was not originally intended to include the 2 x 2 m size and on most forms there is no separate column for this. Species for this gquadrat should be entered in the column ter the 5 eS wm 23 ie uadrat and a clear line drawn across the column where the smaller quadrat ends and the larger one begins.  Having recorded all species in a given quadrat size, the corner  pegs are moved one marker further out and the new area thus enclosed is searched for additional _ species only, which are recorded in  their appropriate column (under the line.delineating the 2 x2m quadrat in the case of the 5 x 5 m size). This procedure is repeated until the full 14.14 x 14.14 m (200 m ) has been recorded. The most convenient method of search for the successive sizes of quadrat, is for the two operators to spiral outwards moving in. opposite directions so that both cover the whole area.  Plants which cannot be immediately identified, or for which a subsequént check, in flora or herbarium, is required, should be placed in a labelled polythene bag. Specimens for the herbarium (see Appendix I) should be collected at the same time.  Because of identification difficulties, bryophytes are not being  recorded in the field but a comprehensive collection of all bryo- phytes growing on the soil (but NOT on tree bases, logs, rocks or other specialised habitats) should be made in the course of searching the plot for vascular plants. These should be placed in the poly- thene bag supplied and labelled on completion. Great care should be taken to include samples of the less common or inconspicuous 6;  &  species. No breakdown of bryophytes into the successive quadrat sizes is required; just one collection from the whole 14.14 x 14.14 m plot. Having completed the record of presence of the vascular plants in all five quadrat sizes and collected the sample of bryophytes, an estimate of cover abundance for the full plot (14,14 x 14.14 m) should be carried out. This should include  all vascular plants recorded as present, plus the six additional categories (litter, wood, rock, bare ground, water and bryophytes ) printed at the foot of the forn. This is best accomplished by imagining 100 random strikes with a pin over the whole plot and estimating how many times it would touch the species in question. Estimates should be given to the nearest 5% only. Species present in appreciable quantity (either in area occupied or number of individuals, if widely scattered), but with less than 5% cover, should be recorded as 1. Those which are present as only single or few specimens with little cover should be recorded as _ +. The  total cover should add up to about 100% (making due allowance for the +*s and 1's), or more if the ground flora is markedly layered. These values should be entered in the right-hand column. The left-hand column, headed Code No., is for \"office use only\" (where the species identification codes will be inserted for subsequent data punching).  (b) Trees, saplings and shrubs  These are recorded in the 14.14 x 14.14 m plot, the laying out of which has already been described in (a) above. Decisions as to whether individuals are in the plot or not.are based on rooted base being 50% or more within the plot.  (i) . Trees - stems of >5'cm D.B.H. of any species which is normally capable of attaining a tree like habit. Exceptions include hazel, blackthorn, viburnum, juniper .and a number of other less common shrubs, which rarely produce stems >5 cm  diameter anyway. The species and D.B.H. (cm) of all stems  in the whole plot over 5 cm diameter is measured (recording by quarters). Trees with multiple stems have each stem measured and recorded separately but these are bracketed together on the _Eecording sheet. Dead trees (standing of course) or dead stems  on multi-stemmed trees, are designated by a capital \"D\" in the top right-hand corner of the cell in which its diameter is recorded.  (ii) Saplings - tree species, with the same definition as (i), but with a height >130 cm (i.e. over breast height) but <5 om D.B.H. are recorded only in the diagonally opposite quarters 1 and 3 (see Fig. 2 = numbers on right angle gauge). The same measurements as for trees, species and D.B.-H. (cm), ‘are recorded for these with the same conventions for multi- stemmed and dead trees or stems*.  (iii) Shrubs - as defined above according to species. Like the saplings these are only recorded in the diagonally opposite quarters 1 and 3; same data, same conventions.  * See additional instructions for Native Pinewood Survey. ~  The final job is to measure the height of the Largest tree in the plot (the tree with the largest D.B.H. ~ regardless of species). This is done using the height measuring instrument provided (Haga  or Blume-Leiss hypsometer). In the eventuality of the largest tree being in some way atypical (i.e. top broken off) the next largest should be substituted.  An example of a completed recording form is given in Appendix III.  (c) Plot Description and Habitats  This is recorded on the basis of presence within the 14,14 x 14.14 m plot by striking out the appropriate attributes on the Forine> /k detailed account of methods and definitions of the attributes is given in Appendix IV. In the case of attributes which have an appreciable defined area, e.g. ponds, glades, etc., only part of  the full area need to be included in the plot for it to be recorded as present. For example if only part of a glade 50 m across occurred actually within the plot .it would be recorded as present  and attribute 76 struck off.  The plot formis in fact a much reduced version of the site form. The object of the plot form is to obtain frequency data about some of the more important attributes which can reasonably be expected to occur a measurable number of times within a single site. Definitions for all the attributes occur in Appendix IV, the second number in brackets referring to plot form (first and without brackets to the site form). Only attributes 5 and 6 (really codes for variables) need further explanation.  “4 Slope in degrees of: % - (depends on whether you are equipped with a Haga (%) or a Blume~Leiss (_) hypsometer. Thisi das measured on a 20 m baseline passing through the plot centre (10 m either side) between the lowest and highest point that can be found by rotating the axis of the. 1ine. The best method is to locate your partner at the top ‘end of the base- line and measure the’ angle from his eye to yours (suitable corrections should be made for poorly matched height pairs).  6 Aspect ia magnetic - is.the bearing of the line of maximum slope used for 5 above. Care should be taken not to record the back-bearing, the down slope bearing is what is required.  The comments column can be used to record any information that is not included elsewhere and is considered relevant or useful in  interpretation.  Finally, a sketch of the ground profile along the line of maximum slope (same line as the slope that was actually measured) should be entered on the reverse side of the plot description and habitat form. This should show all the major features within the plot such as. cliffs, rocks or lesser irregularities in the ground,  banks boggy areas, Streams, etc. The plot centre and two  corners should be marked to give scale. Some artistic. Hicence  is permissible as to the exact line of section and the represent- ation of features. Annotations can be included and additional  sections if the topography is complex. (d) Soil Data  A full description of the methods of interpretation and recording of the soil data is given in Appendix V.  The small pit and auger samples are taken from the centre of the plot or as near as possible (not more than 1 m distant). A small pit is dug using the entrenching tool to expose the upper 25-30 cm of the profile (less if this is not possible). This will usually yield information on the Aoo, Ao, Al or A2 and possibly the upper part of the B horizons. A basic interpretation of what is visible can be made and the information on the upper horizon recorded. Investigation of the lower horizons can then be accomplished, probably with no further digging, using the screw auger. This instrument can also be used to determine the depth of soil if within auger range (i.e. about 70 cm or 80 cm using the DLT).  Having completed the record forn, a composite sample of the top 10-15 cm mixed should be obtained from the wall of the pit. A total of 700-800 g, i.e. a bag full, should be obtained if  possible.  If difficulties in obtaining sufficient sample are encountered it may be necessary to supplement from nearest possible point in the plot, (again within 1 m distance). Should this occur, @ note to this effect should be appended to the soil data form. The 6.011  pit should be filled in and roughly disguised before leaving the  plot —<this) is: important.  Completion of the Plot  Having filled in all 4 sets of data and collected both series of samples, the recording of the plots is now complete, or at least it should be. Atthis: point, it das. advisable to:-  (i) Check that all forms have been fully entered ~ a quick check through to see that major items have not been omitted should be made, and that the site and plot number have _ been  correctly entered at the top of each form.  (ii) Check all the samples into the sample carrying haversack.  (iii) Check all the equipment:into the equipment carrying haversack.  (iv) Check the soil pit has been filled in.  (v) Take one last quick look round the plot to see that _ nothing important has been omitted and no equipment left behind.  The data you are collecting is being collected \"forever\". Make sure that it is comprehensive and correct to the best of your ability, even at the expense of taking a little extra time. One additional set of data has to be collected for the site as a whole (i.e. comprising the pilots and the ground in-between), namely site description and habitats for the whole site - separate but Similar form to that for the plot.  ee Se EE RS SR ES  A detailed description of how this data should be collected and recorded on the form and definitions for all attributes is given in Appendix IV (attribute numbers not in brackets). Coverage  is of the whole site, both within and between plots. In order to record section L (Marginal Land Use) and M (Boundary Type) it will almost certainly be necessary to walk round all or part of the boundary. Use of control points on the boundary, where this is possible, can be made to economise on walking. Useful information can also be obtained from the site map.  Completion of the Site  When the whole site has been completed (4 sets of data and 2 sets of samples for 16 plots, plus the site description and habitats) all the sheets should be stapled together in plots, using the mini stapler provided, checked and put into the polythene bag they  were supplied in. Four cardboard boxes have been supplied for each site and the soil samples should be put into three of these (checking at the same time that they are all present and correct and securely labelled) so that no box weighs more than about  16 lbs (maximum weight for a ist class parcel). The bryophytes and field sheets, sealed in their polythene bag, should be placed in the remaining box (it might be necessary to overflow bryophytes into a soil box). The boxes should be sealed and securely tied up wing the sellotape and string provided. A pre-paid, pre- addressed sticker and tie-on labei should be affixed to each and the parcels despatched by post at the earliest convenient opportunity. It is desirable to measure the pH reasonably fresh and it will also prevent your vehicle becoming cluttered up with  samples. aleotee :  ytinut: oqo  who patmosed OA ay yEOY 19VETG Aeta Liiw ook See eolqmse- @rt, No. 2  centre post \\ L  and right angle gauge  marker tags  Figure 2 LAYOUT OF GROUND FLORA QUADRATS  Ort.

A type specimen should be obtained for all species occurring  in the quadrats. As good a specimen as possible should be obtained with sufficient morphological characters to permit accurate identification later (preferably with flowering shoots). The supposed correct name of the species, or what- ever name or code number it has been entered as in the field sheets, should be written clearly on the herbarium sheet to which the specimen should be securely attached with sellotape. A box file, blotting paper and hardboard sheets cut to size and sellotape are all provided for use in preparation of the herbarium.  When collecting and subsequently recording species under a supposed or code name, great care should be taken to ensure that all plants recorded under this identity are indeed the same. Key features for identifying such species should be noted at their first occurrence and rigidly adhered to  thereafter. The rule is, if in doubt collect a specimen and _ enter it into the herbarium. If it does turn Gue to be  a duplication nothing is lost and it can be merged with other records for that particular species.  Please try to present a comprehensive and well prepared herbarium. They will be examined in great detail because systematic mis-identification of species could introduce serious errors into the subsequent analysis of data. beg piped dneishtiwe bin, moitss Fas  ‘ i  ‘eaibrosex Soe Sfuoda SI69 Tsotp . oman  & sige Oe ca “te0to. sia bow inex od. iikw Resi :  teyisns, they madi ont peste z0119, 2u0 Lo Aone separ y  Bppendde “Th. ik MUU FLORA be:  x tae Hie et ( oi gmhype fom)  Site No. 200 Plot No. | Recorder MUS. bate 24-//7} Pe Cana.  eeaeT ha A ant Gein ante's tis at ns he Q.25m* Species 2.

The Plot Description and Habitat Form is a somewhat reduced version of the Site Form and one is completed  for each plot (i.e. 16 per site). For, simplicity. in, the subsequent handling of the data, the code numbers for the attri- butes are different on the two forms, the attributes being numbered sequentially on each form without gaps, except for unallocated codes. Since the methods of recording and definitions of attributes remain the same on the two forms it is possible to treat them together by giving both code number series - site code first unbracketed, and plot code second in brackets (). Checking that all the appropriate attributes for a given plot have been recorded is part of the routine procedure dealt with in the main text. A further check should, however, be made that there are no logical inconsistencies between the plot and Site forms; attributes which are present on the plot form must be present on the site form (but not necessarily vice versa). If any significant area of the site has not been covered in connection with locating or recording the plots (or for other purposes) it should be briefly visited to check that no attributes have been missed. Particular care should be taken with the site form as the recording of a given attribute is an all or nothing proposition and is therefore critical.  The attribute code numbers are dealt with in order below: &  S.E. = self-explanatory; and U.A. = unallocated) Pp  a¢¥24 Site Number - S.E. 2°92 ) Plot number - S.E., on site form fill in as 1-16. a 43) Recorder - recorder's initials. 4 (4) Date - day, month, year.

Most multi-stemmed trees are the result of coppicing but not all. Usually the point of cutting can be seen and there are usually >2 stems. Hazel stools should not be recorded as coppice stools unless there are unmistakable cut stems to be seen; a multi-stemmed growth form is normal for this species. Many woods all over Britain, but particularly in the south, were formerly managed on a coppicing system. Most coppice origin woods have not been cut for 20, 50 or even more years and have grown on so that their former use is less evident (but see attribute 10 (9)).  Singled coppice - where, in what was formerly coppice, with a preponderance of multi-stemmed trees, selected stools have had the number of shoots reduced to one by cutting the others off. This can be detected by the swollen base of the tree with scars where the other main shoots were removed or by the presence of residual twiggy growth. Becomes less detectable with time.  Recently cut coppice - where there is evidence that coppicing is still, or has been until very recently,  in progress. Recent coppice can be detected from cut shoot stubs on the stools and/or the presence of coppice produce (see also 20) in the wood. Recent = <c. 5 years.  Mature conifers - trees >40 years old or >20 m height.  Stumps hardwood new - hardwood stumps can usually be distinguished from conifers by the presence of ring-  porous wood and/or medullary rays. Often the remnants of bark can be used to identify the hardwood species, @.g.,0ak, ash; birch. New stumps can be distinguished  from old 13 (11) by the absence of advanced rot, luxuriant growths of bryophytes and by the fact that the ring growth is still discernible wthout cutting or scraping the stump.  Stumps hardwood old - the inverse of the characters used to identify new stumps in 12 (10) above. Stumps of species like birch rot away completely in a very short time’, whilst those of more resistant species like oak persist for many (>50) years, so the old/new scale is necessarily  arbitrary. a = =  EB°({Y29 Stumps conifer new - conifer stumps can be distinguished from hardwoods by the absence of ring-porous wood or medullary rays. Identifiable bark is often useful, as also is resin exudation, and the smell of resin if reasonably fresh. Apart from Sequoias (not very likely) NO conifers produce any coppice shoots from stumps cut near the ground. So if there are any signs of coppice shoots live or dead it is sure to be hardwood. The same rules for new/old hardwood stumps also apply to conifers. few coppices quite frequently but is easy to identify.  LS {13} Stumps conifer old - fully explained above, S.E.  16 Stumps overgrown - in the more open woodlands, the older stumps in an advanced state of decay will often be comp- letely overgrown by such species as bramble, honeysuckle or bryophytes.  t7? Brashing/pruning =- where the lower branches of the trees have been artificially removed by cutting to improve access and/or timber quality.  18 Brash heaps = can result from brashing or pruning, or from the cutting of scrub species, or as the lop and top (the thinner branches) of felled trees. Essentially,  therefore, a heap of thin branches which have been left to rot.  19 Cord wood = odds and ends of felled trees, almost  invariably hardwood, which have been cut to log size (as for putting on the fire) and have, been piled into regular stacks (usually about 4'-6' high and 2'-3! wide and any length). ;  20 Coppice sticks - the product. from cutting coppice. which has been tidily stacked for subsequent use. Can vary from large sizes such as hop poles down to pea sticks.  aa Stack timber - the larger parts of the. stems of felled trees which have been cut into regular lengths (3' up to 30' or 40%) and stacked. Anything from pulp bolts up to the largest sizes in saw timber.  22 Felled trees - trees that have been felled but have not been processed any further than having had the branches mitt’ Ger:  23 Chips/sawdust - S.E.  24 Fire sites - S.E., often used to get rid of brash 18.  Se Paint/blaze marks - used to mark trees for some special purpose; often for felling, retaining or thinning out  fhe surrounding trees in favour of the,best trees.  ‘Paint °marks may ‘consist of dots,,rings or even numbers. Blaze’ marks consist of.the bark.being.cut off ina strap at about breast height. The latter almost invariably means the treeis marked for felling. Also include scribe marks. 26  27  28  B.  (14)  4.  =  Extraction routes - places where logs have obviously been dragged or strips of trees removed for the same purpose.  Vehicle tracks - the use of vehicles on unmade ground off the main roads or tracks (see also attributes 114-118 (79-82)).  U.A.  Trees - Regeneration  29-48 (15-34) (as per species listed) - regeneration is any tree  Ca  49  50 5 52 be  54  53)  56  57  as  species >25 om height and <5 cm D.B.H. and must _be of seedling origin. The only exception (i-e. non-tree)  is hazel which must of course be >25 cm in height but must also be of obvious, recent, seedling origin (do not record coppice shoots - upper limit of 5 cm hardly applies here). Coppice shoots are not to be recorded as regeneration and care should be taken to check this point as far as possible. Younger seedlings, <25 cm height, wiil be recorded by plots as a part of the ground flora. Regeneration over breast height will similarly be recorded in more detail with the saplings.  Trees - Dead (= Habitats)  (35)  (36)  (37)  (38)  (39)  (40)  (41)  Live/Dead - trees which, although still alive, have substantial dead parts on them, >50%.  Standing dead <10 cm diameter - S.E.

(54) Scree - the essential characteristics of a scree is its actual or potential mobility, thus distinguishing it from a rock pile (attribute 82 (62)). In order to  exhibit this mobility a scree consists of a mass of rock fragments resting at or near the maximum angle of  repose. The instability of a scree is conferred either by additions from above or active erosion at the base (possibly at high datitudes by the severe climatic regime). The minimum size for recording screes is 25 m*..- Man- made screes produced by various earth-moving operations Also count (see also 133 (87) and 134 (88)).

In the case of large surveys, such as the present one, with a total of 1648 plots for which information on the soils is required, it is quite out of the question to carry out a full range of physical or chemical analyses. The traditional methods of studying soils depend largely on descriptive methods which cannot readily be adapted to the types of numerical analysis which are to be used in the current project.  The solution to the problem of obtaining adequate soil data within the resource limitations of the project has been to combine the measurement of a limited number of physical/chemical character- istics together with a numerical method of soil description using presence or absence of attributes. The physical/chemical measure- ments which will be carried out on the soil samples collected  from the plots are:-  (a) PH (b) Loss on ignition  (c) .Mechanical analysis (% sand/silt/clay, by a simplified method )  Dried sub-samples will also be retained so that further analyses may be carried out at a later stage in the project if necessary.  In order to get the maximum interpretable information out of the method of numerical description, it has been found desirable to incorporate some of the elementary profile interpretative procedures which are involved in the standard descriptive methods. This involves dividing the soil profile up into named horizons according to the main trends in the pedological processes. Fortunately there is a fairly limited range of major soil types  in Britain and the identification of the basic pedological process LS; not diificuLt..  Major Woodland Soil Types in Britain  In the basically temperate climate of Britain, most soils under conditions of free drainage belong to the Podzolic Soil Group. This group as a whole is characterised by consisting of freely leached soils in which calcium carbonate (or sulphate) is only a fugitive constituent. They are thus on the acid side of neutrality ;{<pH ;7). Brown earths, brown forest soils, brown podzolic soils and podzols are some of the common types within this group. When drainage conditions become sufficiently impeded, and often this is just a localised condition, there is a transition to hydromorphic soils in which the position of the water table and its chemical composition are the dominant factors. Gley, peat, and similar soils found in marshes and bogs, belong to this group. Similarly, where the weathered mineral layer on which soils are developed is shallow, either due to the nature of the underlying rock or erosion, skeletal soils are developed in which the dominant factor is lack of constituent material. Both hydromorphic and skeletal soils tend to occur mixed with the basic, climatically determined podzolic types, often ina complex mosaic based on the land form and drainage patterns.  The degree to which leaching has advanced in podzolic soils is dependent on a number of factors, some independent, some interrelated. *  (i) Rainfall - or better still the potential amount of water available to run through the soil (= rainfall - evapo- transpiration).  (ii) The nature of the soil matrix - water percolates freely through sandy or stony soils but not through clay.  (iii) The base and/or weatherable mineral content of the soil - siliceous sands and sandstones are low in bases and weatherable minerals, and what there is is soon removed by leaching (water is also free to percolate - see (ii)), whereas calcareous  rocks (chalk and limestone) or base rich igneous rocks are  high in bases, and leaching takes much longer to remove them. Base rich materials often include, or weather to produce,  a high clay fraction, which also tends to reduce the intensity of leaching.  (iv) The vegetation type and/or land use - heathy vegetation, often with burning, increases the rate of leaching (change to mor humus type producing organic acids etc.) whereas mixed deciduous woodland slows leaching down (mull humus and possibly less available leaching water).  (v) Time - the longer the soil has been developing, in the absence of disturbance by erosion, the more leached it will become. In Britain the soils are generally relatively young, those north of the glaciation line (Thames ~- Bristol Channel ) having been under development for only 20,000 years or less.  Many podzolic soils in high rainfall areas (>70\" p.a.) are for various reasons, finely balanced on the threshold of impeded drainage. Changes in land-use and vegetation or advancing podzoloisation can tip the balance resulting in the formation of a surface layer of peat (peats and peaty podzols).  In addition to the podzolic soils and their related types, there is another group of soils which also occur in Britain and will certainly be encountered in the survey, and this is the calcareous soils. These are characterised by the presence of free calcium oa >.  =  carbonate in the profile and are thus on the alkaline side of neutrality, ; (>pH -7,).. As might be expected under British climatic conditions, calcareous soils are limited to those developed on calcium rich rocks, and particularly chalk and limestone. As already explained for the podzolic soils, the dynamics of these soils are also very complex, and they indeed grade without discontinuity into the podzolic group. There is also a strong geographical/geological relationship since the soft, easily weathered chalk mostly occurs in southern England where, due  to the high evapotranspiration, potential leaching is at a  minimum. Under these conditions, calcium carbonate in the profile is thus not readily leached out and the Rendzina soil type is quite common in this area. The harder, less weatherable  limestones, most areas of which occur further north than the chalk, also produce calcareous soils, sometimes black, base saturated soils (pH >7) but under other conditions red soils, ox Terra Rossa, which border on the acidic (c. pH 7) are developed. The degree to which calcium carbonate is retained in the soil depends on such factors as time, rainfall, depth of the soil to the calcareous rock, the hardness or fragment-  ation of that rock. On flat ground markedly acid soils may develop over hard, massive, limestone lying only a few inches below the surface. Similarly, shallow podzols can be observed  on deep soils over chalk in the Chilterns.  In some situations the calcareous base rock (the solid geology) may be overlain by other material of different origin and composition, e.g. may be a layer of non-calcareous drift over a calcareous base rock and in this case, the soil’ profile will be determined by the superficial material. Within a given site, the depth of superficial deposit may vary so that a mosaic of types is produced. Even where larger fragments of limestone are well distributed in the profile, their effect may be quite localised with no free calcium carbonate in most of the material (pH <7). Such soils belong to the podzolic group.  It will be appreciated from the above discussion that the soil forming or pedological processes are essentially dynamic, and most of the soils you will meet in the field will be immature and undergoing changes of one sort or another, which means they will often be transitional between the classical textbook descriptions. if  The use of the mattock and/or trowel to dig a small sloping pit is described in the main text. The auger can be used to investigate the lower levels. The first thing to do is dig  a small pit about 30 cm deep if this is possible (i.e. the  soil is not too rocky or shallow).  Having filled in the attributes 1-4 Site Na, Plot No., etc. at the top of the form, the best procedure is to continue working down the profile (and form) interpreting on the way.  Each section of the form deals with a single named horizon (with the exception of the B horizon which is the Bl and B2 horizon combined). Having decided that a particular horizon is present according to the methods of interpretation and definitions given below, the appropriate section of the form should be completed starting with depth from/to({cm). The from/to method is used instead of simple depth = thickness to avoid cumulative errors  in scaling of the profile. Where horizon limits are irregular  or poorly defined an average or best approximation should be given. Only in C Underlying Material, is the depth given as from, and  if this value is not the soil depth, in terms of auger penetration,  this should be given separately in brackets. Methods of determining, and the definitions of, the other attributes are given in their appropriate sections below. If a given horizon  is not present it should be deleted by a diagonal line and not applicable = N.A. written across it.  Aoo Litter Layer (identifiable plant remains )  This is quite straightforward, either there are plant remains, and they can be identified from their appearance or by inference from the vegetation, or there are not.  Whether there is or is not a layer of identifiable plant remains at the soil surface and its depth, is the first major clue as to the nature of the profile (i.e. the pedological process that is dominant ) :-  (i) If there is no Aoo horizon or a shallow one, thas’ 36 indicative of a MULL humus type and soil profile in which there will probably be no, or a very shallow Ao hotizen; a> + or >= well developed Al horizon, no A2 horizon, and no deposition layer in the B horizon.  (ii) If there is a well developed Aoo, several cm in depth, then this is indicative of a MOR humus type and a soil profile in which there is likely to be a well developed Ao horizon, no or a poorly developed Al horizon, there may be a well developed A2 horizon and there may be a deposition layer in the B horizon.  Intermediate or MODER humus types are quite common, resulting in an intermediate profile type.  Composition - attributes 6-13 are all self-explanatory, more than one may be recorded and normally this will be the case.  Aco Organic Layer (decomposed plant remains with little or no mineral soil)  As explained above this may be very shallow, of vires ioh~ existent, or it may occupy the whole of the rest of the profile with no other recordable horizons; in other words, deep peat.  The presence or absence of mineral material can be tested by _ rubbing a sample between the fingers or on the palm of the hand, when mineral particles will normally be felt. Da  =  Having decided whether or not there is an Ao horizon delete or record.  Texture - attributes 15-17, needs little explanation. Pulling the material apart will detect whether it is 15 fibrous (do not mistake live roots for fibres, dead ones are legitimate) and breaking in the fingers will decide whether it is 16 granular or 17 amorphous.  Moisture - attributes 18-21, should be decided as follows :~  18 v wet - dripping with water without squeezing.  19 wet - water expressed on squeezing.  20 damp - obviously containing appreciable water but none expressed on squeezing.  2k ary -. looks and feels reasonably dry.  Al Mixed Mineral/Organic Layer (humus masking colour of mineral  soil)  Again, the first thing to do is decide if this horizon is present OX DOL. =  (i) If there is a well developed Ai horizon there will be little or no distinction between the Aoo, Ao and Al layers, the profile grading almost imperceptibly from organic? to’ organic/ mineral mixed soil (this is a true brown earth or brown forest soil). In this case, the humus content will gradually decrease with depth, the soil paling from dark brown to.a tighter colour as the true mineral colour of the soil is révealed by decreasing humus content. The actual boundary may be difficult to see and may be <40-50 cm in depth.  On the other hand, the Al horizon may be poorly developed, shallow and exhibiting a + or - sharp transition with the mineral soil below. Common sense, colour and rubbing sample _ between the fingers will decide this.  (ii) If immediately beneath the Ao horizon there is a much paler, often white or greyish, layer with no organic matter in it (if there were organic matter it would be black or brown), then there is indeed no Al horizon and what you are looking at is an A2 horizon (this is a true podzol).  Difficulties may arise in wet soils but this will usually occur  in boggy areas (due to local drainage conditions) or on very heavy clay soils. Both these contingencies will be fairly obvious.  In these cases water level, and the seasonal changes thereof, will be affecting the profile by producing aiternate aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Where this is taking place in mineral soil, deposition of iron oxides on the structural units of the soil.will occur. Breaking the soil between the fingers will reveal alternating pale and ocherous patches. If there is evidence of organic matter in this layer, it must be regarded  as a gleyed Al (and recorded appropriately) if not then it is On  =  a gleyed B horizon (also to be recorded appropriately). Both gleyed Al and B horizons will occur together in some profiles.  If the Al has a high organic content, (but an appreciable quantity of mineral material must still be present} as may occur in boggy areas, the signs of mottling will not be visible. In this case it will be recorded as dark coloured (brown or black), wet or  ve wet Al.  Having decided whether or not an Al horizon is present, delete or record.  Transition with mineral soil - attributes 23 and 24, have already been discussed above and should now be obvious.  Texture - attributes 25-28, can be decided as follows:~- Roll a sample on the palm of the hand, wetting with spit if  necessary. If it can be rolled into a coherant sausage it is either clay or silt.  25 (Glay - if a sausage about 10 cm (4\") long can be bent into a complete circle without breaking (must of’ course be sufficiently moistened) it is clay.  26 Silt - if the sausage breaks it is silt.  27 Sand - aif it cannot be rolled into a sausage it is sand.  28 Stony - unless almost pure gravel will normally be recorded  as well as one of the attributes 25-27. Must be >10% stones of any size to count.  Structure - attributes 29-31, refers to the compounding of the primary particles (sand, silt or clay) into aggregates. Breaking of the soil between the finger will reveal if such aggregates occur.  29 Powder - aggregates non-existent or very weak (coarse sands will usually exhibit this condition but other soils  as well).  30 Crumb - aggregates, as the name suggests, like crumbs from : a loaf of bread.  31 iGlod - aggregates large and adherent, often breaking in more.or less flat sided lumps up to several cm in length. Usually occur only on soils with a high silt -or,claycontent.  Colour - attributes 32-35, self-explanatory. If the*¢6liour is markedly different from black, brown or possibly reddish-brown, then you have probably incorrectly identified this layer as’ Al, because the humus which must be present mixed with the mineral soil, being itself black or brown, will be masking other mineral  colours. oe 7, =  35 mottled, has been adequately described above as indicating alternate aerobic/anaerobic conditions as a result of impeded drainage. Most commonly found in silts or clays.  Moisture - attributes 36-39 as for the Aco horizon. A2 Leached or Eluviated Layer (bleached mineral soil)  The identification of this horizon has already been discussed  at some length in connection with the Ao and Al layers. Normally there will be a very sharp transition of the Ao with a paler  layer of soil, usually showing a whitish or greyish colour,  but it may be speckled with black humus fragments. Beneath this leached layer the soil will be much more brightly coloured again (= B horizon), and in extreme cases will have intensely coloured, horizontal zonation of black and/or reddish-brown colour. The black is humus deposition and the reddish-brown oxides of iron.  A closer examination will reveal that these materials have been deposited on the surface of the soil particles, (sand grains or pebbles). In the majority of cases, particularly in western Britain, the A2 will merely be underlain by a fairly uniforn, bright red or reddish-brown layer which again is the B horizon  but with generalised, rather than localised, deposition of iron oxides. Many of these soils are only incipient podzols and no distinct) A2 horizon will be visible, the profile passing from  a sharply.defined Ao, through a brownish layer to the much brighter B horizon. In this case it will be necessary to record what, although it is an incipient A2, as an Al horizon (small quantities of humus are indeed present in this layer).  Having decided whether an Al horizon is present or not delete or record.  Colour - attributes 40 and 41 have already been explained above. Must be one or other of these colours to be an A2.  Texture - as above for the Al horizon. Is.very unlikely to be clay of course, as the processes leading to the development of an A2 requires both low. base status and free drainage. Note,  that neither structure nor moisture are recorded for this layer as these will invariably be powdery (i.e. no aggregates) and damp or dry, respectively, almost by definition.  B Weathered Mineral Layer (Bl and B2 combined)  The B horizon is commonly divided into two layers, the Bl deposition layer and the B2 weathered mineral soil. For the purposes of this survey they are being grouped together.  As explained above the Bl can consist of local or more generalised deposition of humic or iron materials. A deposition layer is only to be recorded as present if it is of the localised variety with distinct horizontal (may be somewhat wavy) zonation.. .If present, record attributes 48-51, if not, delete and write N.A. on this sub-group of attributes. = Colour - attributes 48 and 49 are self-explanatory.  Compaction - attributes 50 and 51, pick at the layer with a finger tip, if it is hard, record compacted, if not uncompacted.  Texture - attributes 52-55, as Al above.  Colour - (other than deposition layer) attributes 56-60, as Al above.  Structure - attributes 61-63, as Al above.  Moisture - attributes 64-67, as Ao above.  C Underlying Material  This may or may” not be the parent material of the soil and for the purposes of this survey it will not be necessary to determine whether this is the case.  The term underlying material refers to whatever lies under the lowest of the overlying horizons that has been recorded fora given profile. Most commonly it will refer to the material that is immediately under the B horizon but in other cases it may be the Al or Ao horizons, but not the A2 horizon which will always have some sort of B horizon beneath aoe  On deep soils it may not be possible to determine the depth or nature of the underlying material since investigations will be ‘limited to the length of auger (about 70 cm) plus the depth of the hole (i.e. about. 80 cm at the limit). In this case the lower limit of the overlying horizon will be given as 75 cm + and the section on underlying material deleted and TOO DEEP written  , BEXOSS TC é  The most common problem will be determining the transition between the B horizon and the underlying material, and indeed there may be no marked division if the soil matrix is deep and uniform. Generally, the underlying material should be taken as commencing from where there is no further colour change (usually a gradual paling) in the B horizon. Other cases will be quite clear, with +he B or some other horizon lying immediately on the top of  some quite different material such as fragmentary or solid rock, gravel, clay etc. If the depth to which the auger can be inserted in the pit is less than 70 cm this should be recorded separately in a’ bracket () immediately beneath attribute 47.  The ‘Only’ attributes to. be recorded for this horizon are Texture - attributes 69-74. The first four of these are as previously — described for the Al horizon, to which has been added 73 Rock (fragments) and 74 Rock (solid). These are self-explanatory  and both can be recorded if necessary. Pe  Rocks in’ Soii  Refers to stones or rocks anywhere in the profile from surface to underlying material. 9.  = Shape % - attributes (variables) 75-77, record approximate %, self-explanatory; rounded = really rounded, sub-angular = “angular with the corners knocked off, angular - sharp corners.  Size range % - attributes (variables) 78-81, self-explanatory.  Composition % - attributes 82-89, very much depends on how good you are at identifying rocks. Scratching with a knife or breaking with the mattock may assist in identification. Lf <a doubt, retain samples of main types and send samples in with soil in separate bags clearly labelled. Also add note to field sheet to this effect.  Comments  Earthworms - attribute 90, if you see any earthworms whilst digging the profile or observe earthworm burrows or casts record  as present.  Any comments can be added on the reverse side of the form. In cases. of extreme difficulty or doubt in the interpretation of a profile, draw a fully annotated diagram of the horizons observed and their various characteristics, on the back of the form. Disturbed profiles (excavation, ploughing, etc.), buried profiles, newly layed alluvium and soils on steep slopes with rapid  erosion, may all present rather atypical horizons or total  lack of same. Skeletal or immature soils may also have very limited horizon development. Watch out for all of these.  Two sample forms are attached as an example, showing the method of filling in two common profile types:-  A = a deep brown earth.  B = a slightly devéloped podzol.

      "1.   Instructions on methods of survey and recording   1.1.  General  You  will  be  supplied  with  the  necessary  site  and  plot  location maps,  recording  sheets  and  soil  sampling  bags  and  boxes  before  leaving  Merlewood.  A  check  list  of  all equipment  is  given  in  Appendix V. CEH can lend girth tapes for DBH measurement and sighting poles for slope or tree  height measurement if necessary. In any event all survey teams should use the same methods.    Woods will be located using a list of grid references and names for each woodland site, an A4  extract from the relevant 1:50,000 OS map (plus, wherever possible, a copy of the original 2½”  map) showing the location of each site and an enlarged copy of the site sketch map showing the  locations of each of the 16 plot locations that need to be re-recorded (from either the 1:50, 000 or  2 ½” map – please check carefully as this will affect locating plots). Having located the site the  first important thing is obtaining PERMISSION to enter and survey the site in question.   1.2.  Access and Permission to Survey Sites  It  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  surveyors  to  obtain  permission  to  survey  the  woods.  The  contractors  will  provide  such  information  as  they  hold  but  for  some  woods  there  will  be  no  known  owner  and  this  will  need  to  be  established  on  the  ground.  Once  you  have  established  ownership,  record  names  and  addresses  with  the  survey  results  on  the  back  of  the  Site  Description sheet. You MUST obtain permission to access the land.   Experience from Pilot Woodland Re-survey and the Countryside Survey 2000 fieldwork showed  that, in the majority of cases, land-owners could be identified and permissions secured in half a  day  –even  with  multiple  owners.  There  were  very  few  cases  where  land-owners  refused  permission to survey their land. Most are fascinated by the fact that records existed from 1971  and that these records could be accurately updated.    In  order  to  ease  negotiations  you  will  be  provided  with  a  letter  of  introduction  explaining  the  background to the survey. You can also assure any landowner that they will receive a complete  copy of the results (1971 and 2002) for their parcel of land. This is also why it is crucial to note  down addresses and contact numbers for each site.   1.3.  Location of the Sampling Points  A  map  will  be  provided  that  is  marked  with  the  16  random  sampling  points  (numbered  1-16).  Locating these points  on the ground is  an extremely critical  part of the survey procedure upon  which much else depends. There are two important factors in locating the points:   i) Accuracy  ii) Absence of subjective bias (i.e. not exercising choice)   In  practice,  high  accuracy  is  not  possible  without  resorting  to  time-consuming  methods.  However a reasonable degree of accuracy is required if plot and map derived datasets are to be  compatible,  since  certain  information  about  the  plots  (altitude,  slope  position,  measures  of  exposure etc.) will be taken from the map. Three maps will be provided: (i) 1:50 for location, (ii)  a photocopy of the original 2½” with plot locations and (ii) expanded version of the same.   PLEASE NOTE that the contours on the 2½” map are in 25 foot intervals and the original 1971  instructions  to  surveyors  were  that  1/32nd  of  an  inch  =  22  yards.  If  you  have  a  metric  map,  or  wish to work in metres, you will have to convert all distances and slopes accordingly.    3                         \f",
      "There  are  no  permanent  markers  for  each  plot  as  absolute  reference  points  to  determine  the  accuracy  of  relocation.  A  degree  of  re-location  error  is  expected  given  the  lack  of  permanent  markers  but  our  experience  in  the  pilot  survey  shows  that  the  following  re-location  procedure  performs  substantially  better  than  analysis  of  repeat  records  from  a  newly  randomised  set  of  locations.    More important is the avoidance of bias. Such considerations as, “this bit is not very typical”, or,  “we had a bit like this last time, we will walk on another 10 paces, it looks better there”, must be  avoided at all costs. Taking short or long paces in order to avoid  a blackthorn thicket or nettle  bed is an equally serious crime as is the location of plots in situations judged to be in any sense  ‘homogenous’.   PLEASE NOTE THAT  THE USE OF GPS TO LOCATE PLOTS  IS DISCOURAGED. THIS  MAY BRING YOU CLOSER TO THE 1971 MAPPED PLOT LOCATION BUT MAY NOT  NECESSARILY  BRING  YOU  CLOSER  TO  WHERE  THE  PLOT  WAS  ACTUALLY  RECORDED.  BECAUSE  GPS  WAS  NOT  USED  IN  1971  ITS  USE  IN  2003  COULD  INTRODUCE BIAS.    1.4.  Relocation approach:  The approach will be to pace out along a compass bearing having derived a distance and angle  from the plot location map.    Each enlarged map has one complete side of a 1 km square marked on it. This will allow you to  scale between distance on the map and distance on the ground e.g. 1 mm = 10 m on a 1:10,000  map.  Please  note,  plot  location  maps  have  been  enlarged  to  different  extents  to  increase  the  clarity  of  the  plot  locations  so  you  will  need  to  work  out  a  map-to-ground  correspondence  separately for each plot location map.    Bear in mind that the sites may have altered significantly over 30 years. Collect soil samples and  record  the  vegetation  even  if  the  plot  is  no  longer  woodland.  Only  do  not  record  if  it  is  built- over.  We  know  that  at  least  one  site  has  been  bisected  by  a  motorway  since  1971.  Dramatic  changes  in  land-use  may  have  affected  other  sites  as  well.  Do  not  attempt  to  record  plots  that  now fall into land you have no permission to survey but DO make a note of the change in use. In  particular,  do  not  record  plots  on  used  railway  embankments  or  motorway  verges.  Be  sensible  and stay alive!    1.5.  Order of Recording the Data  One site description and habitat form must be completed for each site and three sets of data (each  with its own recording form) and one soil sample must be collected from each plot.    We recommend you use clutch pencils to fill in all recording forms. They do not need sharpening  and since all forms will be printed onto waterproof paper, pencil will be preferable to pen if it is  raining.  An  example  of  each  recoding  form  is  given  in  Appendix  IV.  The  vegetation  plot  for  ground flora should be recorded first so that it is surveyed in a relatively undisturbed state. The  remaining recording can then be carried out in the most manageable order.   Recording Forms for each dataset  (a)   Vegetation  plot.  Ground  Flora  -  presence  and  absence  in  five  successively  increasing  quadrat sizes up to the full 14.14 x 14.14 m, with % cover/abundance estimates for the  largest  of  these.  Major  common  bryophytes  should  be  recorded  but  a  full  list  is  not  expected (see below).  Site description and habitats - mostly presence and absence of attributes.   (b)   4                     \f",
      "(c)   (d)   Trees,  saplings  and  shrubs  -  trees,  DBH  (cm)  and  species  from  all  four  quarters  of  a  14.14  x  14.14  m  plot  (200  m2),  the  same  data  for  saplings  and  shrubs  from  a  pair  of  diagonally opposite quarters 1 and 3 of the plot.  Plot description and habitat data - mostly presence and absence of attributes, from the  same 14.14 x 14.14 m plot.   Samples    (i)  A soil sample dug from each plot to be obtained at the same time as the plot survey.    The methods of setting out the plots and the collecting and recording of the data are now dealt  with in detail.   2.   Recording of Plot Data   There  are  four  recording  forms  for  the  following  categories.  The  Appendix  provides  further  details on individual categories and classifications.   2.1.  Vegetation plot: Ground Flora  The first operation when the plot centre has been located, is to lay out the plot. The four corner  posts delineate the largest 14.14 x 14.14 m (200 m2) plot. The plot should be located so that the  diagonal  strings,  and  hence  corners  of  the  plot,  are  orientated  along  cardinal  compass  points.  Spaced along each of the distance strings are four coloured markers that give the half-diagonal  distances of the four smaller plots (see Figure 2). Starting with the smallest 2 x 2 m plot, the area  within  is  carefully  searched  recording  the  presence  of  all  ground  flora  species  -  all  vascular  plants (monocots, dicots, and ferns) - including tree or shrub seedlings <25 cm in height. A  record  of  the  presence  of  species  in  this  innermost  quadrat  are  made  by  inserting  a  1  in  the  column  headed  Q  on  the  vegetation  plot  recording  sheet  and  in  the  row  corresponding  to  the  species  concerned  (see  Appendix  II).  If  the  species  is  not  listed  then  pencil  in  the  entry  in  the  blank rows under ‘Other species’ at the bottom of the sheet. Plants which cannot be immediately  identified, or for which a subsequent check, in flora or herbarium, is required, should be placed  in a labelled paper bag.   Having recorded all species in a given quadrat size, the new area enclosed by the next successive  set of markers is searched for additional species only. This procedure is repeated until the full  14.14  x  14.14  m  (200  m2)  has  been  recorded.  The  most  convenient  method  of  search  for  the  successive  sizes  of  quadrat  is  for  the  two  operators  to  spiral  outwards  moving  in  opposite  directions so that both cover the whole area. Record successive quadrats by inserting the quadrat  number (2 to 5) in the Q column; as for quadrat 1.   Because  of  identification  difficulties,  only  the  common  major  bryophytes  growing  on  the  soil  should be recorded (not on tree bases, logs, rocks or other specialised habitats). A list of these  is given in Appendix I.   Having  completed  the  record  of  presence  of  the  vascular  plants  in  all  five  quadrat  sizes,  an  estimate of cover abundance for the full plot (14.14 x 14.14 m) should be made and inserted next  to each species in any one of the two columns headed % (see Appendix II). This should include  all vascular plants plus tree/shrub seedlings recorded as present, plus the six additional categories  (litter,  wood,  rock,  bare  ground,  water  and  bryophytes).  Estimates  should  be  given  to  the  nearest  5%  only.  Species  present  in  appreciable  quantity  (either  in  area  occupied  or  number  of  individuals,  if  widely  scattered),  but  with  less  than  5%  cover,  should  be  recorded  as  1.  Those  present  as  only  single  or  few  specimens  with  little  cover  should  be   5                       \f",
      "recorded as +. The total cover should add up to ca. 100% (making due allowance for the +’s and  1's), or more if the ground flora is markedly layered. Note that tree and shrub canopy cover is  not included as the canopy composition and age-class distribution is recorded instead.   2.2.  Trees, saplings and shrubs  These  are  recorded  in  the  14.14  x  14.14  m  plot,  the  laying  out  of  which  has  already  been  described in (a) above. Decisions as to whether individuals are in the plot, or not, are based on  rooted base being 50% or more within the plot.   (i)  Trees  are  defined  as  stems  of  >5  cm  DBH  of  any  species  which  is  normally  capable  of  attaining  a  tree  like  habit.  Exceptions  include  Hazel,  Blackthorn,  Viburnum  spp.,  Juniper  and  other  shrubs,  which  rarely  produce  stems  >5  cm  diameter  anyway.

      "species  and  DBH  (cm)  of  all  stems  in  the  whole  plot  over  5  cm  diameter  is  measured  (recording by quarters of the plot). Trees with multiple stems have each stem measured  and recorded separately but these are bracketed together on the recording sheet (see  Appendix  III).  Dead  trees  (standing  of  course)  or  dead  stems  on  multi-stemmed  trees,  are  designated  by  a  capital  “D”  in  the  top  right-hand  corner  of  the  cell  in  which  its  diameter is recorded.   (ii) Saplings  - tree species, with  the same definition as  (i), but  with  a height  >130 cm  (ie over  breast height) but <5 cm DBH are recorded only in the diagonally opposite quarters 1 and  3. Quarter 1 is always the NE quadrant. Quarter 3 is always the SW quadrant (see  Figure 2). The same measurements as for trees, species and DBH (cm), are recorded for  these with the same conventions for multi-stemmed and dead trees or stems.   (iii)   Shrubs  -  as  defined  above  according  to  species.  Like  the  saplings  these  are  only  recorded in the diagonally opposite quarters 1 and 3; same data, same conventions.   The final job is to measure the height of the largest tree in the plot (the tree with the largest DBH  -  regardless  of  species).  It  is  recommended  that  you  use  an  Abney  hand  level,  clinometer  or  hygrometer.  If  provided  with  a  hygrometer  –  please  use  this  in  preference.  Failing  this  you  MUST calibrate  your preferred method against the hygrometer and detail the  calibration in the  record sheets. Whichever method is used always ensure that your horizontal distance is taken  along the same contour: the slope should be zero between the observer and the base of tree.  If this proves impossible then you must record the ground slope so that a correction can be  made later. In the eventuality of the largest tree being in some way atypical (i.e. top broken off)  the  next  largest  should  be  substituted.  An  example  of  a  completed  recording  form  is  given  in  Appendix III.   (1) Height Measurement with a clinometer    Insert the horizontal distance and angle to the top of the tree next to the relevant individual on  the DBH data sheet  (see Appendix III).  Note you will have to insert the horizontal distance  between  observer  and  tree  plus  the  angle  to  treetop.  The  actual  height  will  then  be  calculated in the spreadsheets you will use for data entry after the survey.   (2) Height Measurement with a hypsometer  If these are available then instructions will be provided following training on the field course   7    Use a clinometer to measure the angle between ground and tree topto give Xo.    XoHorizontal distance on level ground (H)Tree height = (Tan (Xo) x H) + height from ground to eye level            \f",
      "Plot description and habitats   2.3.  These are recorded on the basis of presence within the 14.14 x 14.14 m plot by striking out the  appropriate  attributes  on  the  form.  The  object  of  this  form  is  to  obtain  frequency  data  about  important  attributes  that  can  reasonably  be  expected  to  occur  a  measurable  number  of  times  within a single site.  A detailed account  of methods and definitions of the attributes is  given in  Appendix IV (the second number in brackets referring to the plot form attributes). In the case of  attributes  that  have  an  appreciable  defined  area,  e.g.  ponds,  glades, etc.,  only  part  of  the  full area needs to be in the plot for it to be recorded as present. For example if only part of a  glade 50 m across occurred actually within the plot it would be recorded as present and attribute  76 struck off. The comments column can be used to record any information that is not included  elsewhere and is considered relevant or useful in interpretation.   Soil sampling   2.4.  The objective is to obtain a composite soil sample from each plot. Soil samples are to be taken  from the centre of each plot or as near as possible (not more than 1 m distant).    Each  sample  bag  must  have  a  self-adhesive  label  stuck  on  indicating  site  and  plot  (labels  provided – ideally done when the bag is dry before starting fieldwork). Wherever possible, bags  should  also  be  marked  using  a  permanent  marker  in  the  field  after  the  soil  sample  has  been  collected – on the bag itself, showing site and plot. Unknown soil samples results in the loss of  data – hence double labeling to reduce such error.    Soil  samples  are  to  be  taken  from  the  top  15  cm  of  the  soil  using  a  trowel.  Before  taking  the  sample,  check  for  fresh  plant  litter  (green)  on  the  surface  of  the  soil.  Carefully  remove  this  to  expose the layer of decomposing plant  material  below.  If in  doubt  – include in  the sample for  later removal at CEH. If the area is rocky – remove the largest rocks to expose the soil surface. If  there is more rock that soil – move to another area (within 1 m distance).   If  difficulties  in  obtaining  sufficient  sample  are  encountered,  then  supplement  from  nearest  possible point in the plot, (again within 1 m distance) – but ensuring to sample the top 15 cm of  soil again. Should this occur, a note to this effect should be appended to the data form. The hole  should be filled in and roughly disguised before leaving the plot - this is important.    Record any problems/changes in soil sampling on the plot form.   The sample should be a representative sample of the entire 0 to 15 cm of soil and fill ca. ¾ of the  bag,  wherever  possible.  Bags  are  all  self-sealing,  so  when  filled,  seal  to  keep  air-tight  and  prevent loss of soil.    All soil sample bags should be kept in the plastic boxes corresponding to each site (marked using  the self-adhesive labels) and stored in a cool place until returned to CEH Merlewood.   8                     \f",
      "2.5.  Completion of the Plot  Having filled in all data recording forms and collected all necessary samples, the recording of the  plots is now complete. At this point it is advisable to:   (i)   check  that  all  forms  have  been  fully  entered  –  make  a  quick  check  to  see  that  major items  have not  been omitted, and that the  site, plot number and  date of  survey have been correctly entered at the top of each form.   (ii)   Check all the samples into your rucksack.   (iii)  Check all the equipment into your rucksack.   (iv)  Check the soil sampling area has been filled in.   (v)   Take  one  last  quick  look  round  the  plot  to  see  that  nothing  important  has  been  omitted and no equipment left behind.   The data you are collecting is being collected “forever”. Make sure that it is comprehensive and  correct to the best of your ability even at the expense of taking a little extra time.   One additional set of data has to be collected for the site as a whole (i.e. comprising the plots and  the  ground  in-between),  namely  site  description  and  habitats  for  the  whole  site  -  separate  but  similar form to that for the plot.   3.   Site Description and Habitats   Recording forms   3.1  A  detailed  description  of  how  this  data  should  be  collected  and  recorded  on  the  form  and  definitions  for  all  attributes  is  given  in  Appendix  IV  (attribute  numbers  not  in  brackets).  Coverage  is  of  the  whole  site,  both  within  and  between  plots.  In  order  to  record  section  L  (Marginal Land Use) and M (Boundary Type) it will almost certainly be necessary to walk round  all or part of the boundary. Useful information  can also  be obtained  from  the site map. Please  make full use of comments section to note any features may help in the interpretation of change.  Also  make  sure  you  record  any  information  gleaned  from  conversation  with  the  land-owner,  although  such  anecdotal  information  will  not  be  consistently  recorded  it  can  help  when  interpreting change. Since surveyors are required to draft brief pen sketches of each site, it will  be in your interest to complete the plot and site descriptor sheets in the field.    Completion of the Site   3.1  When the whole site has been completed (4 sets of data and 2 sets of samples for 16 plots, plus  the  site  description  sheet)  all  the  sheets  should  be  stapled  together  in  plots,  checked  for  completeness and put back into the cardboard site folder ready for data entry.    9                               \f",
      "4.   Soil dispatch to Merlewood   When all 16 soil samples from each plot are in the plastic box, you are now ready to dispatch to  CEH Merlewood. An address label is supplied to be taped to each box when ready for dispatch.   Options  for  returning  samples  are:  delivery  by  hand  if  you  are  in  the  area;  courier;  recorded  delivery next day post; collection by CEH (when this is local or near a CEH station). Options for  sample return will be finalised in discussion with surveyors at the field course. Each survey team  should,  ideally  ensure  that  samples  are  sent  so  that  they  arrive  at  CEH  Merlewood  within  the  week they are sampled.  Please remember that  CEH Merlewood is  closed over the weekend so  courier/post will not be delivered to CEH Merlewood on a Saturday or Sunday. It is much better  to keep the samples until the following week in a cool place than send them on a Friday when  they could end up sitting somewhere hot for two days.    10       \f",

      "Appendix IV   INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE PLOT AND SITE DESCRIPTION  AND HABITAT FORMS   General  One copy of the Site Description and Habitat Form is completed for each site. The Plot  Description and Habitat Form is a somewhat reduced version of the Site Form and one  is completed for each plot (i.e. 16 per site). For simplicity in the subsequent handling of  the  data,  the  code  numbers  for  the  attributes  are  different  on  the  two  forms,  the  attributes  being  numbered  sequentially  on  each  form  without  gaps,  except  for  unallocated codes. Since the methods of recording and definitions of attributes remain  the  same  on  the  two  forms  it  is  possible  to  treat  them  together  by  giving  both  code  number series - site code first unbracketed, and plot code second in brackets ( ).   Checking that all the appropriate attributes for a given plot have been recorded is part  of the routine procedure dealt with in the main text. A further check should, however,  be  made  that  there  are  no  logical  inconsistencies  between  the  plot  and  site  forms;  attributes which are present on the plot form must be present on the site form (but not  necessarily  vice  versa).  If  any  significant  area  of  the  site  has  not  been  covered  in  connection  with  locating  or  recording  the  plots  (or  for  other  purposes)  it  should  be  briefly visited to  check that no attributes have been missed. Particular care should be  taken  with  the  site  form  as  the  recording  of  a  given  attribute  is  an  all  or  nothing  proposition and is therefore critical.   The attribute code numbers are dealt with in order below:   (SE = self-explanatory; and UA = unallocated).   1   2  3  4   A.  5   6   7   8 (7)   Site Number - SE  Plot number - SE, on site form fill in as 1 -16   (1)  (2)  (3)  Recorder - recorder's initials  (4)  Date - day, month, year. Inclusive dates on site form.  (5)   Slope  -  (plot  only)  in  _  or  %.  Depends  on  the  instrument  provided  -  Blume Leiss = _, Haga = %. (See main text for methods).  Aspect - _ magnetic, SE (See main text for methods).   (6)  Trees - Management   Planted  hardwoods  -  must  be  clear  evidence  that  the  trees  have  been  planted,  eg  visible  lines,  uniform  age  and/or,  in  the  case  of  mixtures,  regular alternation of species. Gets more difficult to detect planted origin  with age.  Planted conifers - these can usually be assumed to be planted except in  the  case  of  European  larch  and  Scots  pine,  unless  there  is  strong  evidence  to  the  contrary,  eg  irregular  distribution  and  age.  May  be  natural regeneration of some species.  Pollards - trees that have had their main branch systems cut off at some  time  at  a  height  above  breast  height  (4'3\"  or  130  cm)  but  have  now  resprouted.  An  ancient  method  of  marking  boundaries  or  obtaining  firewood and/or browse for stock.  Coppice  stools  -  trees  that  have  been  cut  off  below  breast  height  and  have  resprouted.  Most  multi-stemmed  trees  are  the  result  of  coppicing  but not all. Usually the point of cutting can be seen and there are usually   15                       \f",
      ">2 stems.  Hazel  stools  should  not  be recorded as coppice stools unless  there  are  unmistakable  cut  stems  to  be  seen;  a  multi-stemmed  growth  form  is  normal  for  this  species.  Many  woods  all  over  Britain,  but  particularly in the south, were formerly managed on a coppicing system.  Most  coppice origin  woods have not  been cut  for 20, 50 or even more  years and have grown on so that their former use is less evident (but see  attribute 10 (9)).  Singled  coppice  -  where,  in  what  was  formerly  coppice,  with  a  preponderance  of  multi-stemmed  trees,  selected  stools  have  had  the  number of shoots reduced to one by cutting the others off. This can be  detected by the swollen base of the tree with scars where the other main  shoots  were  removed  or  by  the  presence  of  residual  twiggy  growth.  Becomes less detectable with time.  Recently cut coppice - where there is evidence that coppicing is still, or  has been until very recently, in progress. Recent coppice can be detected  from  cut  shoot  stubs  on  the  stools  and/or  the  presence  of  coppice  produce (see also 20) in the wood. Recent - <c 5 years.  Mature conifers - trees >40 years old or >20 m height.  Stumps hardwood new - hardwood stumps can usually be distinguished  from  conifers  by  the  presence  of  ring-porous  wood  and/or  medullary  rays. Often the remnants of bark  can be used to  identify the hardwood  species,  eg  oak,  ash,  birch.  New  stumps  can  be  distinguished  from  old  13 (11) by the absence of advance rot, luxuriant growths or bryophytes  and by the fact that the ring growth is still discernible without cutting or  scraping the stump.  Stumps hardwood old - the inverse of the characters used to identify new  stumps  in  12  (10)  above.  Stumps  of  species  like  birch  rot  away  completely  in  a  very  short  time,  whilst  those  of  more  resistant  species  like oak persist for many (>50) years, so the old/new scale is necessarily  arbitrary.  Stumps  conifer  new  -  conifer  stumps  can  be  distinguished  from  hardwoods  by  the  absence  of  ring-porous  wood  or  medullary  rays.  Identifiable bark is often useful, as also is resin exudation, and the smell  of  resin  if  reasonably  fresh.  Apart  from  Sequoias  (not  very  likely)  NO  conifers  produce  any  coppice  shoots  from  stumps  cut  near  the  ground.  So if there are any signs of coppice shoots live or dead it is sure to be  hardwood.  the  same  rules  for  new/old  hardwood  stumps  also  apply  to  conifers. Yew coppices quite frequently but is easy to identify.  Stumps conifer old - fully explained above, SE.  Stumps overgrown - in the more open woodlands, the older stumps in an  advance  state  of  decay  will  often  be  completely  overgrown  by  such  species as bramble, honeysuckle or bryophytes.  Brashing/pruning  -  where  the  lower  branches  of  the  trees  have  been  artificially removed by cutting to improve access and/or timber quality.  Brash heaps - can result from brashing or pruning, or from the cutting of  scrub species, or as the lop and top (the thinner branches) of felled trees.  Essentially,  therefore,  a  heap  of  thin  branches  which  have  been  left  to  rot.  Cord wood - odds and ends of felled trees, almost invariably hardwood,  which have been cut to log size (as for putting on the fire) and have been  piled into regular stacks (usually about 4'-6' high and 2'-3' wide and any  length).   16   9 (8)   10 (9)   11  12 (10)     13 (11)     14 (12)     15 (13)    16   17   18   19                 \f",

Can vary from large sizes such as hop poles  down to pea sticks.  Stack  timber  -  the  larger  parts  of  the  stems  of  felled  trees  which  have  been cut into regular lengths (3' up to 30' or 40') and stacked. Anything  from pulp bolts up to the largest sizes in saw timber.  Felled trees - trees that have been felled but have not been processed any  further than having had the branches cut off.  Chips/sawdust - SE  Fire sites - SE, often used to get rid of brash 18.  Paint/blaze marks  - used to  mark trees for some  special purpose;  often  for  felling,  retaining  or  thinning  out  the  surrounding  trees  in  favour  of  the best trees. Paint marks may consist of dots, rings or even numbers.  Blaze marks consist  of the bark being  cut  off in  a strip  at  about  breast  height. The latter almost invariably means the tree is marked for felling.   Also include scribe marks.  Extraction  routes  -  places  where  logs  have  obviously  been  dragged  or  strips of trees removed for the same purpose.  Vehicle  tracks  -  the  use  of  vehicles  on  unmade  ground  off  the  main  roads or tracks (see also attributes 114-118 (79-82)).  UA   B.   Trees - Regeneration   29-48 (15-34)  (as per species listed) - regeneration is any tree species >25cm height  and <5cm DBH and must be of seedling origin. The only exception (ie non- tree)  is  hazel  which  must  of  course  be  >25  cm  in  height  but  must  also  be  of  obvious, recent, seedling origin (do not record coppice shoots - upper limit of 5  cm hardly applies here). Coppice shoots are not to be recorded as regeneration  and  care  should  be  taken  to  check  this  point  as  far  as  possible.  Younger  seedlings, <25 cm height, will be recorded by plots as a part of the ground flora.  Regeneration over breast  height  will similarly be recorded in  more detail with  the saplings.

Rocks 5-50 cm - SE.  Boulders >50 cm - SE.  Scree - the essential characteristics of a scree is its actual or potential  mobility, thus distinguishing it from a rock pile (attribute 82 (62)). In  order  to  exhibit  this  mobility  a  scree  consists  of  a  mass  of  rock  fragments  resting  at  or  near  the  maximum  angle  or  repose.  The  instability  of  a  scree  is  conferred  either  by  additions  from  above  or  active  erosion  at  the  base  (possibly  at  high  altitudes  by  the  severe  climatic  regime).  The  minimum  size  for  recording  screes  is  25  m2.  Man-made  screes  produced  by  various  earth-moving  operations  also  count (see also 133 (87) and 134 (88)).  Rock outcrop <5 m (height) - should be, as far as it is possible to tell,  part  of  the  solid  geology.  Height  refers  to  vertical  height  (includes  low angle outcrops such as limestone pavement).  Cliff >5 m - a larger version of 77 (55).

      "Non-ASCII character: Soil and vegetation radionuclide activity concentrations and calculated dose rates from the Red Forest, Chernobyl, Ukraine, 2016-2017 | Data comprise plot details and radionuclide activity concentrations for Sr-90, Cs-137, Am-241, Pu-238, Pu-239 and Pu-240 in âgrassyâ vegetation and soil. These radionuclide activity concentrations have been used to make estimations of total weighted absorbed doses to grassy vegetation, deciduous trees and bacteria; no dose rate estimates for grassy vegetation have been made for those sites where grassy vegetation was absent.Radiation from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident killed coniferous trees in a 4-6 km2 area of forest to the west of the power plant. This area is now known as the 'Red Forestâ and it has subsequently regenerated with understorey vegetation and deciduous trees; it is the most anthropogenically contaminated radioactive ecosystem on Earth. In July 2016 a severe fire burnt (to varying degrees) c. 80 percent of the Red Forest; this presented a unique opportunity to study the impact of radiation on the recovery of forest ecosystems exposed to a secondary stressor (fire). To investigate this, in September 2017 the RED FIRE project set up sixty study plots in the Red Forest (in burnt and unburnt areas) with a further nine plots established close to Buriakivka village (approximately 8 km from the Red Forest).Vegetation samples from each plot were harvested using shears in September 2017. Each sample was sorted into âgrassyâ and âotherâ vegetation; these were air-dried (20-25 degrees Celsius) and the grassy vegetation samples homogenised prior to radionuclide analyses.Soil core samples collected in September 2017 were bulked, homogenised and sub-samples taken for determination of pH and percentage moisture determined by oven drying (approximately 60 degrees Celsius) to a constant mass. The remaining soil sample was used for the determination of radionuclide activity concentrations; prior to analyses, these samples were dried at approximately 80 degrees Celsius.This work was funded by the NERC, Grant Ref: NE/P015212/1 (RED FIRE: Radioactive Environment Damaged by fire: a Forest In Recovery)Publication date: 2021-02-26 |\n",

Background and introduction This dataset maps the Input to Yield Ratio (IYR) of wheat farming in England, calculated as the ratio of agrochemical inputs to agricultural reward as yield. We assess the IYR at a 1km resolution for wheat grown in England over the period the period 2010-2017, considering the different agrochemicals used and their differing forms of environmental impact. We provide four mapped products: IYR for Nitrogen fertilisers, IYR for Phosphorus fertilisers, IYR for pesticide risk to earthworms, and IYR for pesticide risk to honeybees. The IYR is calculated using scaled rather than absolute values, with the maximum value in each yield and inputs dataset set as 1, so that all inputs and rewards are expressed proportionally to each other. The IYR dataset allows us to evaluate trade-offs between farming yields and agrochemical inputs at large spatial scales. It can inform targeting of actions to improve sustainability of arable farming, or locations where it is best to switch to other forms of farming or land uses such as ecosystem restoration (Bullock et al., 2023). Data description This dataset comprises four single-layer TIFF files, each with a resolution of 1km and British National Grid spatial reference system. Individual files contain the IYR values for each grid cell for the specific harm type: input_to_yield_ratio_honeybees.tif input_to_yield_ratio_nitrogen_fertilisers.tif input_to_yield_ratio_phosphorus_fertilisers.tif input_to_yield_ratio_earthworms.tif  Note that areas with no data can arise because estimates are not available for 1km cells where no winter wheat was grown.

Data can be accessed via the Environmental Information Data Centre (http://eidc.ceh.ac.uk/).  Example outputs  Maps and frequency distributions of the Input to Yield Ratios over England are shown in Figure 1, as in Bullock et al. (2023).  Figure 1. Frequency distributions and maps, at 1 km resolution, of the Input to Yield Ratios over England for two fertiliser-related and two pesticide-related inputs in relation to winter wheat yield. A higher value indicates greater potential harm for the wheat yield obtained. Colours in the maps match those in the histograms. No wheat was grown in the white areas Detailed methodology We assessed the winter wheat yields and potential harms from different agrochemicals applied to winter wheat crops across England, using spatially-explicit, national-extent estimates of variables, which we combined to calculate the IYR. All datasets were drawn from the period 2010-2017, although the different periodicity of agricultural surveys for yield, fertiliser and pesticide data, and the availability of Sentinel data for crop mapping, means that the datasets cover slightly different ranges within this period. We calculated single values averaged across years to increase the pool of available data. All maps (individual variables and IYR) were produced at 1 km resolution. We mapped estimated pesticide and fertiliser applications to winter wheat across England using data from the FERA Pesticide Utilisation Survey (FERA, 2022) and the British Survey of Fertiliser Practice (Defra, 2022), respectively. Areas with winter wheat crop were identified from the UKCEH Land Cover® plus: Crops map (2017). Estimated pesticide applications were converted to risk values to honeybees and earthworms using information on toxicity from the Pesticide Property Database (PPDB, 2022). Data from the June Survey of Agricultural and Horticultural activity (Defra, 2018) were used to create an average wheat yield map for England. We then compared the fertiliser and pesticide data separately to the estimated yields of wheat in order to derive the Input to Yield Ratio (IYR) for four separate harms: Nitrogen fertilisers, Phosphorus fertilisers, pesticide risk to earthworms, and pesticide risk to honeybees. An overview of the product creation process is shown in Figure 2. Please see Bullock et al. (2023) for a more in-depth methodology.

This should attempt to reduce the amount of travelling as far as possible but must also take accommodation problems into account (i.e. it may be more efficient to survey several sites from the same base, rather than moving to get slightly nearer), any arrangements with Regional Staff and access permission if this is limited to specified dates. I You will be supplied with a full set of field equipment including all the necessary maps, recording sheets and other ancillary equipment before leaving Merl ewood. A check list of all equipment is given in Appendix VI. F Woods will be located using road maps, 1\" Ordnance Survey and the 23\" site maps as required. Having located the site the first important thing is obtaining PERMISSION to enter and survey the site in question. é Access _and Permission to Survey Sites You will be given advanced information about all your sites which will indicate whether or not you are solely responsible for obtaining permission. In certain cases the Regional Office will have indicated in advance that special circumstances prevail with regard to access. For example, advance permission may have been obtained by the Regional Office or Merlewood, in which case you can proceed straight on to carry out the survey. In other cases, it may be necessary to contact Regional Staff or the land-owner himself (in which case all details will be supplied), and all that is necessary here is to Follow rout the instructions. In other cases the task of obtaining permission to survey the site will be your responsibility. In some instances the owner's name and address may be supplied and you should contact him or her. In other cases there may be several owners, some known, some unknown, and here it will be best to contact one of the owners (probably the one who owns the largest area if this is known) ask his permission and whether any of the others will mind. If he says yes on both counts you may proceed, and, in the unlikely event of your meeting any of the other owners, you will have to explain the situation. In yet other cases, and these may be in the majority in some areas, ownership of the woods may be a complete blank. In this case the best procedure is to contact the occupants of the farm or house, if any, which is nearest to the wood, and look as if they might themselves own it. Ask them if they do own it and if so, can you have permission to carry out your survey. If they do not own it ask who does. If they know, it may be possible to ask if the owner would mind (this may be particularly useful if the owner does not live locally). If the real owner does live locally, it will be best to carry on to ask his permission direct. 2 x In general, all that is required is common sense and tact. Ery and appreciate the owners problems; he may have fences and walls which he fears will get damaged; he may be raising game birds; he may just like his privacy and so on. If you meet with great reluctance or a blank refusal withdraw politely explaining that we have a list of alternative back-up sites which can be used if they would prefer not to allow access to their wood. If an owner gives you permission, as in our experience the vast majority will, ask him if there are areas he would like you to avoid or any precautions he would like you to take. You will be provided with a brief written description of what the survey is about. If the owner, or anybody you come into contact with, asks you what it.is all for, let him read this slip and try and answer any questions as best you can. If things get tricky offer to find out the answer for him or refer him direct to Merlewood. Good public relations are an extremely important facet of the Nature Conservancy's work. If you upset anybody with whom you come into contact, the Regional Staff, in whose area you are working will be the ones who have to deal with the repercussions. Above all, make it quite clear the Nature Conservancy is not surveying their wood with a view to purchasing it. Some owners may fear compulsory purchase, a power which the Nature Conservancy holds (but has never exercised), or some other lesser interference with their ownership and enjoyment of the site. In the case of the present survey, nothing could be further removed from the intent, although it is of course remotely possible that the survey might turn up a few new sites which would be regarded as being of high conservation value. Some of the sites are already notified Sites of Special Scientific Interest, (S.S.S.I.s) or Proposed ~ National Nature Reserves (P.N.N.R»S), in which case the owner will know all about it anyway. ; % If you are unable to get permission to visit a site or think it unwise to pursue the matter further, you will have to contact Mexrlewood so that you can be supplied with the necessary i on mation (map, sampling points, etc.) for the back-up site. Give a forwarding or poste restante address, and then you can work on other sites until the information is available. Starting the Survey Having obtained permission to visit the site the best access point(s) should be determined, as far as possible reducing the walking distance for yourself carrying equipment and samples. It may, for example, be possible to go to some of the sample points from an access point at one end of the wood and the rest from the other end. Do not, however, upset surrounding owners by flogging across fields or fences just to save a few yards walking. Try and use well marked tracks or footpaths wherever possible; it usually saves time and temper in the long run, and avoids many navigational difficulties. ae Location of the Sampling Points The 23\" map of the site has 16 random sampling points (numbered 1=16) marked on it and the method of locating these points on the ground is an extremely critical part of the survey procedure upon which much else depends. There are two important factors in the locating of the points:= (1) Accuracy (2) Absence of subjective bias (i.e. exercising choice) the latter being far more important than the former, although high accuracy automatically ensures absence of bias. In: practice, high accuracy is not possible without resorting to time consuming methods using survey poles, tapes, compasses etc., and since pin-point accuracy has no intrinsic value, more rapid, primitive methods of locating the points are valid so long as the unbiased nature of the process is not prejudiced. The essential features of the method adopted, and described below, are its predetermined, mechanical characteristics, of which reasonable accuracy is a part. Since certain information about the plots, e.g. altitude, slope position, measures of exposure, etc. will be taken from the map, a reasonable degree of accuracy is required if site and map collected data are to be compatible. The level of accuracy to be aimed at, and this should be easily obtainable in nearly all circumstances, is to get the sampling point within a 20 m radius of its true location. The following procedure should be followed :- (a) Decide on the point to be sampled next (they need not be surveyed in numerical order if this is not convenient ). (b) Look on the map for the nearest point that can be accurately and unmistakeably pin-pointed on the ground {a control point), €.g. a ride intersection, intersection of a wall or stream or a marked change in direction of a fence line etc. (c) By orientating the map and compass take a bearing from the control point to the sample point, not forgetting to add 9° for magnetic variation. (d) Using the scale on the side of the compass, measure the distance from the control point to the sample point. On the 24\" = 1 mile scale 1/32nd = 22 yards. (e) Find the control point on the ground. (f) Take the correct compass bearing from the control point to the sample point and pace out the correct distance in this direction. Some correction for slope is adviseable if this is more than 20°, as follows:- 20° = + 6%, 25° = + 10%, 30° = + 15%, 35° = + 22%, 40° = + 31% Keeping accurate paces either up or down steep slopes is difficult and it is best to avoid both this problem and the slope correction oe & by choosing a control point at the same height on the slope, if this is possible, and pacing on the level. across the slope (even if it is a bit further than from some other .control point). (g) Short of endangering one's life, adhere absolutely to the number of paces that were predetermined, the centre point of the plot being adjacent to the toe of the boot on the forward foot. Similarly, wandering away from the predetermined direction must be avoided, even at the expense of making life difficult. Such considerations as, this bit is not very typical\", or, \"we had a bit like this last time, we will walk on another 10 paces, it looks better there\", must be avoided at all costs. Taking short or long paces in order to avoid a blackthorn thicket or nettle bed is an equally serious crime. Order of Recording the Data Having located the sample point according to the methods described above, four sets of data (a separate recording form for each) and two sets of Samples have to be collected from each point. A flow chart showing the organisation and division of responsibility for the survey and recording of a site, and the plots therein, is given in Fig. 1. (a) Ground Flora - presence and absence in five successively ‘increasing quadrat sizes (see details ‘below and Fig. 2) and % cover/abundance estimates for the largest of these. A comprehensive sample of bryophytes is also collected from the full plot. (b) Trees, saplings and shrubs - trees, D.B.H. (cm) and species being recorded from all four quarters of a 14,14 x 14.14 m plot (200 m2), the same data for saplings and shrubs being collected from a pair of diagonally opposite quarters 1 and 3 (see Fige 2). (c) Plot description and habitat data - mostly presence and absence of attributes, from the same 14,14 x 14.14.m plot. (d) Soil data - from a small pit and auger borings taken in the centre of the plot. A composite soil sample from the top 10-15 cm is also obtained at the same time. These can be obtained in any other order if this is found to be more convenient, except that the (a) ground flora should be | recorded first so that it is not unduly disturbed by the extensive trampling that is usually involved in recording (b) tree,saplings and shrubs and to a lesser extent (d) the soil data. The methods of laying out the necessary plots and the collecting and recording of the data are now dealt with in detail. Recording of Plot Data (a) Ground Flora The first operation when the plot centre has been located, is to lay out the plot. The centre post is stuck firmly in the ground at this point and the right angle gauge on top, spun to give a random orientation to the plot. When this has ceased turning, the clamping nut is screwed tight to prevent further movement. The four corner poles now have their distance lines (10 m) clipped into the centre and run out to their full extent in line with the arms of the right angle gauge and stuck into the ground. These corner posts delineate the largest 14.14 x 14.14 m (200 m= ) plot. Spaced along each of the distance strings are four coloured markers which give the half-diagonal distances of the four smaller plots (see Fig. 2). The four short pegs supplied are used to mark the corners of the successively larger plots for 2 x 2 Tl (4 m@) up to 10 x 10 m (100 m7), Starting with the smallest 2 x 2 m plot, the area within is carefully searched recording the presence of all ground flora species = all vascular plants (monocots., dicots. and ferns) - including tree or shrub seedlings <25 cm in height. The species names (or the abbreviation thereof as used on a B.SeBole card) are entered in the wide column under the appropriate quadrat size. Assigned names which are specified in the herbarium (see Appendix I) can also be used. NoBo It was not originally intended to include the 2 x 2 m size and on most forms there is no separate column for this. Species for this gquadrat should be entered in the column ter the 5 eS wm 23 ie uadrat and a clear line drawn across the column where the smaller quadrat ends and the larger one begins. Having recorded all species in a given quadrat size, the corner pegs are moved one marker further out and the new area thus enclosed is searched for additional _ species only, which are recorded in their appropriate column (under the line.delineating the 2 x2m quadrat in the case of the 5 x 5 m size). This procedure is repeated until the full 14.14 x 14.14 m (200 m ) has been recorded. The most convenient method of search for the successive sizes of quadrat, is for the two operators to spiral outwards moving in. opposite directions so that both cover the whole area. Plants which cannot be immediately identified, or for which a subsequént check, in flora or herbarium, is required, should be placed in a labelled polythene bag. Specimens for the herbarium (see Appendix I) should be collected at the same time. Because of identification difficulties, bryophytes are not being recorded in the field but a comprehensive collection of all bryo- phytes growing on the soil (but NOT on tree bases, logs, rocks or other specialised habitats) should be made in the course of searching the plot for vascular plants. These should be placed in the poly- thene bag supplied and labelled on completion. Great care should be taken to include samples of the less common or inconspicuous 6; & species. No breakdown of bryophytes into the successive quadrat sizes is required; just one collection from the whole 14.14 x 14.14 m plot. Having completed the record of presence of the vascular plants in all five quadrat sizes and collected the sample of bryophytes, an estimate of cover abundance for the full plot (14,14 x 14.14 m) should be carried out. This should include all vascular plants recorded as present, plus the six additional categories (litter, wood, rock, bare ground, water and bryophytes ) printed at the foot of the forn. This is best accomplished by imagining 100 random strikes with a pin over the whole plot and estimating how many times it would touch the species in question. Estimates should be given to the nearest 5% only. Species present in appreciable quantity (either in area occupied or number of individuals, if widely scattered), but with less than 5% cover, should be recorded as 1. Those which are present as only single or few specimens with little cover should be recorded as _ +. The total cover should add up to about 100% (making due allowance for the +*s and 1's), or more if the ground flora is markedly layered. These values should be entered in the right-hand column. The left-hand column, headed Code No., is for \"office use only\" (where the species identification codes will be inserted for subsequent data punching). (b) Trees, saplings and shrubs These are recorded in the 14.14 x 14.14 m plot, the laying out of which has already been described in (a) above. Decisions as to whether individuals are in the plot or not.are based on rooted base being 50% or more within the plot. (i) . Trees - stems of >5'cm D.B.H. of any species which is normally capable of attaining a tree like habit. Exceptions include hazel, blackthorn, viburnum, juniper .and a number of other less common shrubs, which rarely produce stems >5 cm diameter anyway. The species and D.B.H. (cm) of all stems in the whole plot over 5 cm diameter is measured (recording by quarters). Trees with multiple stems have each stem measured and recorded separately but these are bracketed together on the _Eecording sheet. Dead trees (standing of course) or dead stems on multi-stemmed trees, are designated by a capital \"D\" in the top right-hand corner of the cell in which its diameter is recorded. (ii) Saplings - tree species, with the same definition as (i), but with a height >130 cm (i.e. over breast height) but <5 om D.B.H. are recorded only in the diagonally opposite quarters 1 and 3 (see Fig. 2 = numbers on right angle gauge). The same measurements as for trees, species and D.B.-H. (cm), ‘are recorded for these with the same conventions for multi- stemmed and dead trees or stems*. (iii) Shrubs - as defined above according to species. Like the saplings these are only recorded in the diagonally opposite quarters 1 and 3; same data, same conventions. * See additional instructions for Native Pinewood Survey. ~ The final job is to measure the height of the Largest tree in the plot (the tree with the largest D.B.H. ~ regardless of species). This is done using the height measuring instrument provided (Haga or Blume-Leiss hypsometer). In the eventuality of the largest tree being in some way atypical (i.e. top broken off) the next largest should be substituted. An example of a completed recording form is given in Appendix III. (c) Plot Description and Habitats This is recorded on the basis of presence within the 14,14 x 14.14 m plot by striking out the appropriate attributes on the Forine> /k detailed account of methods and definitions of the attributes is given in Appendix IV. In the case of attributes which have an appreciable defined area, e.g. ponds, glades, etc., only part of the full area need to be included in the plot for it to be recorded as present. For example if only part of a glade 50 m across occurred actually within the plot .it would be recorded as present and attribute 76 struck off. The plot formis in fact a much reduced version of the site form. The object of the plot form is to obtain frequency data about some of the more important attributes which can reasonably be expected to occur a measurable number of times within a single site. Definitions for all the attributes occur in Appendix IV, the second number in brackets referring to plot form (first and without brackets to the site form). Only attributes 5 and 6 (really codes for variables) need further explanation. “4 Slope in degrees of: % - (depends on whether you are equipped with a Haga (%) or a Blume~Leiss (_) hypsometer. Thisi das measured on a 20 m baseline passing through the plot centre (10 m either side) between the lowest and highest point that can be found by rotating the axis of the. 1ine. The best method is to locate your partner at the top ‘end of the base- line and measure the’ angle from his eye to yours (suitable corrections should be made for poorly matched height pairs). 6 Aspect ia magnetic - is.the bearing of the line of maximum slope used for 5 above. Care should be taken not to record the back-bearing, the down slope bearing is what is required. The comments column can be used to record any information that is not included elsewhere and is considered relevant or useful in interpretation. Finally, a sketch of the ground profile along the line of maximum slope (same line as the slope that was actually measured) should be entered on the reverse side of the plot description and habitat form. This should show all the major features within the plot such as. cliffs, rocks or lesser irregularities in the ground, banks boggy areas, Streams, etc. The plot centre and two corners should be marked to give scale. Some artistic. Hicence is permissible as to the exact line of section and the represent- ation of features. Annotations can be included and additional sections if the topography is complex. (d) Soil Data A full description of the methods of interpretation and recording of the soil data is given in Appendix V. The small pit and auger samples are taken from the centre of the plot or as near as possible (not more than 1 m distant). A small pit is dug using the entrenching tool to expose the upper 25-30 cm of the profile (less if this is not possible). This will usually yield information on the Aoo, Ao, Al or A2 and possibly the upper part of the B horizons. A basic interpretation of what is visible can be made and the information on the upper horizon recorded. Investigation of the lower horizons can then be accomplished, probably with no further digging, using the screw auger. This instrument can also be used to determine the depth of soil if within auger range (i.e. about 70 cm or 80 cm using the DLT). Having completed the record forn, a composite sample of the top 10-15 cm mixed should be obtained from the wall of the pit. A total of 700-800 g, i.e. a bag full, should be obtained if possible. If difficulties in obtaining sufficient sample are encountered it may be necessary to supplement from nearest possible point in the plot, (again within 1 m distance). Should this occur, @ note to this effect should be appended to the soil data form. The 6.011 pit should be filled in and roughly disguised before leaving the plot <this) is: important. Completion of the Plot Having filled in all 4 sets of data and collected both series of samples, the recording of the plots is now complete, or at least it should be. Atthis: point, it das. advisable to:- (i) Check that all forms have been fully entered ~ a quick check through to see that major items have not been omitted should be made, and that the site and plot number have _ been correctly entered at the top of each form. (ii) Check all the samples into the sample carrying haversack. (iii) Check all the equipment:into the equipment carrying haversack. (iv) Check the soil pit has been filled in. (v) Take one last quick look round the plot to see that _ nothing important has been omitted and no equipment left behind. The data you are collecting is being collected \"forever\". Make sure that it is comprehensive and correct to the best of your ability, even at the expense of taking a little extra time. One additional set of data has to be collected for the site as a whole (i.e. comprising the pilots and the ground in-between), namely site description and habitats for the whole site - separate but Similar form to that for the plot. ee Se EE RS SR ES A detailed description of how this data should be collected and recorded on the form and definitions for all attributes is given in Appendix IV (attribute numbers not in brackets). Coverage is of the whole site, both within and between plots. In order to record section L (Marginal Land Use) and M (Boundary Type) it will almost certainly be necessary to walk round all or part of the boundary. Use of control points on the boundary, where this is possible, can be made to economise on walking. Useful information can also be obtained from the site map. Completion of the Site When the whole site has been completed (4 sets of data and 2 sets of samples for 16 plots, plus the site description and habitats) all the sheets should be stapled together in plots, using the mini stapler provided, checked and put into the polythene bag they were supplied in. Four cardboard boxes have been supplied for each site and the soil samples should be put into three of these (checking at the same time that they are all present and correct and securely labelled) so that no box weighs more than about 16 lbs (maximum weight for a ist class parcel). The bryophytes and field sheets, sealed in their polythene bag, should be placed in the remaining box (it might be necessary to overflow bryophytes into a soil box). The boxes should be sealed and securely tied up wing the sellotape and string provided. A pre-paid, pre- addressed sticker and tie-on labei should be affixed to each and the parcels despatched by post at the earliest convenient opportunity. It is desirable to measure the pH reasonably fresh and it will also prevent your vehicle becoming cluttered up with samples. aleotee : ytinut: oqo who patmosed OA ay yEOY 19VETG Aeta Liiw ook See eolqmse- @rt, No. 2 centre post \\ L and right angle gauge marker tags Figure 2 LAYOUT OF GROUND FLORA QUADRATS Ort.

A type specimen should be obtained for all species occurring in the quadrats. As good a specimen as possible should be obtained with sufficient morphological characters to permit accurate identification later (preferably with flowering shoots). The supposed correct name of the species, or what- ever name or code number it has been entered as in the field sheets, should be written clearly on the herbarium sheet to which the specimen should be securely attached with sellotape. A box file, blotting paper and hardboard sheets cut to size and sellotape are all provided for use in preparation of the herbarium. When collecting and subsequently recording species under a supposed or code name, great care should be taken to ensure that all plants recorded under this identity are indeed the same. Key features for identifying such species should be noted at their first occurrence and rigidly adhered to thereafter. The rule is, if in doubt collect a specimen and _ enter it into the herbarium. If it does turn Gue to be a duplication nothing is lost and it can be merged with other records for that particular species. Please try to present a comprehensive and well prepared herbarium. They will be examined in great detail because systematic mis-identification of species could introduce serious errors into the subsequent analysis of data. beg piped dneishtiwe bin, moitss Fas ‘ i ‘eaibrosex Soe Sfuoda SI69 Tsotp . oman & sige Oe ca “te0to. sia bow inex od. iikw Resi : teyisns, they madi ont peste z0119, 2u0 Lo Aone separ y Bppendde “Th. ik MUU FLORA be: x tae Hie et ( oi gmhype fom) Site No. 200 Plot No. | Recorder MUS. bate 24-//7} Pe Cana. eeaeT ha A ant Gein ante's tis at ns he Q.25m* Species 2.

The Plot Description and Habitat Form is a somewhat reduced version of the Site Form and one is completed for each plot (i.e. 16 per site). For, simplicity. in, the subsequent handling of the data, the code numbers for the attri- butes are different on the two forms, the attributes being numbered sequentially on each form without gaps, except for unallocated codes. Since the methods of recording and definitions of attributes remain the same on the two forms it is possible to treat them together by giving both code number series - site code first unbracketed, and plot code second in brackets (). Checking that all the appropriate attributes for a given plot have been recorded is part of the routine procedure dealt with in the main text. A further check should, however, be made that there are no logical inconsistencies between the plot and Site forms; attributes which are present on the plot form must be present on the site form (but not necessarily vice versa). If any significant area of the site has not been covered in connection with locating or recording the plots (or for other purposes) it should be briefly visited to check that no attributes have been missed. Particular care should be taken with the site form as the recording of a given attribute is an all or nothing proposition and is therefore critical. The attribute code numbers are dealt with in order below: & S.E. = self-explanatory; and U.A. = unallocated) Pp a¢¥24 Site Number - S.E. 2°92 ) Plot number - S.E., on site form fill in as 1-16. a 43) Recorder - recorder's initials. 4 (4) Date - day, month, year. Inclusive dates on site form. (44 Slope - (plot only) in ss gr %. Depends on the instrument = provided - Blume Leiss = , Haga = % (see main text for methods). (6) Aspect - ° magnetic, S.E. (see main text for methods ). A. Trees - Management . . . : 2 Planted hardwoods - must be clear evidence that the trees have been planted, e.g. visible lines, uniform. age and/or, in the case of mixtures, regular alternation of species. Gets more difficult to detect planted origin with age. 8 9 10 LL Aae LB (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) & Planted conifers - these canwsually be assumed to be planted except in the case of European larch and Scots pine, unless there is strong evidence to the contrary, e.g. irregular distribution and age. May be natural regeneration of some species. Pollards - trees that have had their main branch systems cut off at some time at a height above breast height (4°3\" or 130 cm) but have now resprouted. An ancient method of marking boundaries or obtaining firewood and/ or browse for stock. Coppice stools - trees that have been cut off below breast height and have resprouted. Most multi-stemmed trees are the result of coppicing but not all. Usually the point of cutting can be seen and there are usually >2 stems. Hazel stools should not be recorded as coppice stools unless there are unmistakable cut stems to be seen; a multi-stemmed growth form is normal for this species. Many woods all over Britain, but particularly in the south, were formerly managed on a coppicing system. Most coppice origin woods have not been cut for 20, 50 or even more years and have grown on so that their former use is less evident (but see attribute 10 (9)). Singled coppice - where, in what was formerly coppice, with a preponderance of multi-stemmed trees, selected stools have had the number of shoots reduced to one by cutting the others off. This can be detected by the swollen base of the tree with scars where the other main shoots were removed or by the presence of residual twiggy growth. Becomes less detectable with time. Recently cut coppice - where there is evidence that coppicing is still, or has been until very recently, in progress. Recent coppice can be detected from cut shoot stubs on the stools and/or the presence of coppice produce (see also 20) in the wood. Recent = <c. 5 years. Mature conifers - trees >40 years old or >20 m height. Stumps hardwood new - hardwood stumps can usually be distinguished from conifers by the presence of ring- porous wood and/or medullary rays. Often the remnants of bark can be used to identify the hardwood species, @.g.,0ak, ash; birch. New stumps can be distinguished from old 13 (11) by the absence of advanced rot, luxuriant growths of bryophytes and by the fact that the ring growth is still discernible wthout cutting or scraping the stump. Stumps hardwood old - the inverse of the characters used to identify new stumps in 12 (10) above. Stumps of species like birch rot away completely in a very short time’, whilst those of more resistant species like oak persist for many (>50) years, so the old/new scale is necessarily arbitrary. a = = EB°({Y29 Stumps conifer new - conifer stumps can be distinguished from hardwoods by the absence of ring-porous wood or medullary rays. Identifiable bark is often useful, as also is resin exudation, and the smell of resin if reasonably fresh. Apart from Sequoias (not very likely) NO conifers produce any coppice shoots from stumps cut near the ground. So if there are any signs of coppice shoots live or dead it is sure to be hardwood. The same rules for new/old hardwood stumps also apply to conifers. few coppices quite frequently but is easy to identify. LS {13} Stumps conifer old - fully explained above, S.E. 16 Stumps overgrown - in the more open woodlands, the older stumps in an advanced state of decay will often be comp- letely overgrown by such species as bramble, honeysuckle or bryophytes. t7? Brashing/pruning =- where the lower branches of the trees have been artificially removed by cutting to improve access and/or timber quality. 18 Brash heaps = can result from brashing or pruning, or from the cutting of scrub species, or as the lop and top (the thinner branches) of felled trees. Essentially, therefore, a heap of thin branches which have been left to rot. 19 Cord wood = odds and ends of felled trees, almost invariably hardwood, which have been cut to log size (as for putting on the fire) and have, been piled into regular stacks (usually about 4'-6' high and 2'-3! wide and any length). ; 20 Coppice sticks - the product. from cutting coppice. which has been tidily stacked for subsequent use. Can vary from large sizes such as hop poles down to pea sticks. aa Stack timber - the larger parts of the. stems of felled trees which have been cut into regular lengths (3' up to 30' or 40%) and stacked. Anything from pulp bolts up to the largest sizes in saw timber. 22 Felled trees - trees that have been felled but have not been processed any further than having had the branches mitt’ Ger: 23 Chips/sawdust - S.E. 24 Fire sites - S.E., often used to get rid of brash 18. Se Paint/blaze marks - used to mark trees for some special purpose; often for felling, retaining or thinning out fhe surrounding trees in favour of the,best trees. ‘Paint °marks may ‘consist of dots,,rings or even numbers. Blaze’ marks consist of.the bark.being.cut off ina strap at about breast height. The latter almost invariably means the treeis marked for felling. Also include scribe marks. 26 27 28 B. (14) 4. = Extraction routes - places where logs have obviously been dragged or strips of trees removed for the same purpose. Vehicle tracks - the use of vehicles on unmade ground off the main roads or tracks (see also attributes 114-118 (79-82)). U.A. Trees - Regeneration 29-48 (15-34) (as per species listed) - regeneration is any tree Ca 49 50 5 52 be 54 53) 56 57 as species >25 om height and <5 cm D.B.H. and must _be of seedling origin. The only exception (i-e. non-tree) is hazel which must of course be >25 cm in height but must also be of obvious, recent, seedling origin (do not record coppice shoots - upper limit of 5 cm hardly applies here). Coppice shoots are not to be recorded as regeneration and care should be taken to check this point as far as possible. Younger seedlings, <25 cm height, wiil be recorded by plots as a part of the ground flora. Regeneration over breast height will similarly be recorded in more detail with the saplings. Trees - Dead (= Habitats) (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) Live/Dead - trees which, although still alive, have substantial dead parts on them, >50%. Standing dead <10 cm diameter - S.E. Standing dead >10 cm diameter - S.E. Fallen broken - trees dead, or recently alive, which have fallen and are lying on or near the ground due to the main trunk breaking. Includes trees that have been felled and abandoned. Must be <10 cm diameter at widest point - does not include very small trees. Fallen uprooted - as for 52 but uprooted with a mass of soil and roots pulled out of the ground leaving a hole. Must be >10 cm diameter again. Log very rotten - a very old version of 52 (35) or 53 (36), the sort you can kick into with your boot (with no broken taes). Must be >10 cm diameter again. Fallen branch >10 cm diameter - S.E. Hollow trees - as indicated by large holes in base or higher up, S.E. Rot hole - smaller holes <25 cm diameter where branches have fallen off or the tree has been damaged in some way. In general not large or deep enough to indicate the tree is hollow. Stump <10 cm diameter - hardwood or conifer of any age and state of decay. 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 a, 72 E. 73 74 Was; 76 Dee: ey % (42 ) Stump +10 cm diameter - as for 58 (41) apart from size.

(54) Scree - the essential characteristics of a scree is its actual or potential mobility, thus distinguishing it from a rock pile (attribute 82 (62)). In order to exhibit this mobility a scree consists of a mass of rock fragments resting at or near the maximum angle of repose. The instability of a scree is conferred either by additions from above or active erosion at the base (possibly at high datitudes by the severe climatic regime). The minimum size for recording screes is 25 m*..- Man- made screes produced by various earth-moving operations Also count (see also 133 (87) and 134 (88)).

Height refers to vertical height (includes low angle outcrops such as limestone pavement). Cliff >5 m - a larger version of 77 (55). Rock ledges - horizontal surfaces of any size on rock outcrops or cliffs (77 (55) and 78 (56)).

Field - a field is a definite management division, an area of ground being currently or having been in the past managed as a field. Normally there will be well marked boundaries with the wood = wall or fence, but these may be in poor repair. In order to count as being in the wood it must be at least partly within the survey boundary and enclosed on at least three sides by the wood. Path 1-5 m - not normally used by wheeled vehicles. Vegetated apart from a narrow trodden area. Ride >5 m - same as for 114 (”9) but largely vegetated. Track non-prepared - quite extensively used by wheeled vehicles and therefore deeply rutted, vegetation being significantly affected by this use (>25% destroyed).

In the case of large surveys, such as the present one, with a total of 1648 plots for which information on the soils is required, it is quite out of the question to carry out a full range of physical or chemical analyses. The traditional methods of studying soils depend largely on descriptive methods which cannot readily be adapted to the types of numerical analysis which are to be used in the current project. The solution to the problem of obtaining adequate soil data within the resource limitations of the project has been to combine the measurement of a limited number of physical/chemical character- istics together with a numerical method of soil description using presence or absence of attributes. The physical/chemical measure- ments which will be carried out on the soil samples collected from the plots are:- (a) PH (b) Loss on ignition (c) .Mechanical analysis (% sand/silt/clay, by a simplified method ) Dried sub-samples will also be retained so that further analyses may be carried out at a later stage in the project if necessary. In order to get the maximum interpretable information out of the method of numerical description, it has been found desirable to incorporate some of the elementary profile interpretative procedures which are involved in the standard descriptive methods. This involves dividing the soil profile up into named horizons according to the main trends in the pedological processes. Fortunately there is a fairly limited range of major soil types in Britain and the identification of the basic pedological process LS; not diificuLt.. Major Woodland Soil Types in Britain In the basically temperate climate of Britain, most soils under conditions of free drainage belong to the Podzolic Soil Group. This group as a whole is characterised by consisting of freely leached soils in which calcium carbonate (or sulphate) is only a fugitive constituent. They are thus on the acid side of neutrality ;{<pH ;7). Brown earths, brown forest soils, brown podzolic soils and podzols are some of the common types within this group. When drainage conditions become sufficiently impeded, and often this is just a localised condition, there is a transition to hydromorphic soils in which the position of the water table and its chemical composition are the dominant factors. Gley, peat, and similar soils found in marshes and bogs, belong to this group. Similarly, where the weathered mineral layer on which soils are developed is shallow, either due to the nature of the underlying rock or erosion, skeletal soils are developed in which the dominant factor is lack of constituent material. Both hydromorphic and skeletal soils tend to occur mixed with the basic, climatically determined podzolic types, often ina complex mosaic based on the land form and drainage patterns. The degree to which leaching has advanced in podzolic soils is dependent on a number of factors, some independent, some interrelated. * (i) Rainfall - or better still the potential amount of water available to run through the soil (= rainfall - evapo- transpiration). (ii) The nature of the soil matrix - water percolates freely through sandy or stony soils but not through clay. (iii) The base and/or weatherable mineral content of the soil - siliceous sands and sandstones are low in bases and weatherable minerals, and what there is is soon removed by leaching (water is also free to percolate - see (ii)), whereas calcareous rocks (chalk and limestone) or base rich igneous rocks are high in bases, and leaching takes much longer to remove them. Base rich materials often include, or weather to produce, a high clay fraction, which also tends to reduce the intensity of leaching. (iv) The vegetation type and/or land use - heathy vegetation, often with burning, increases the rate of leaching (change to mor humus type producing organic acids etc.) whereas mixed deciduous woodland slows leaching down (mull humus and possibly less available leaching water). (v) Time - the longer the soil has been developing, in the absence of disturbance by erosion, the more leached it will become. In Britain the soils are generally relatively young, those north of the glaciation line (Thames ~- Bristol Channel ) having been under development for only 20,000 years or less. Many podzolic soils in high rainfall areas (>70\" p.a.) are for various reasons, finely balanced on the threshold of impeded drainage. Changes in land-use and vegetation or advancing podzoloisation can tip the balance resulting in the formation of a surface layer of peat (peats and peaty podzols). In addition to the podzolic soils and their related types, there is another group of soils which also occur in Britain and will certainly be encountered in the survey, and this is the calcareous soils. These are characterised by the presence of free calcium oa >. = carbonate in the profile and are thus on the alkaline side of neutrality, ; (>pH -7,).. As might be expected under British climatic conditions, calcareous soils are limited to those developed on calcium rich rocks, and particularly chalk and limestone. As already explained for the podzolic soils, the dynamics of these soils are also very complex, and they indeed grade without discontinuity into the podzolic group. There is also a strong geographical/geological relationship since the soft, easily weathered chalk mostly occurs in southern England where, due to the high evapotranspiration, potential leaching is at a minimum. Under these conditions, calcium carbonate in the profile is thus not readily leached out and the Rendzina soil type is quite common in this area. The harder, less weatherable limestones, most areas of which occur further north than the chalk, also produce calcareous soils, sometimes black, base saturated soils (pH >7) but under other conditions red soils, ox Terra Rossa, which border on the acidic (c. pH 7) are developed. The degree to which calcium carbonate is retained in the soil depends on such factors as time, rainfall, depth of the soil to the calcareous rock, the hardness or fragment- ation of that rock. On flat ground markedly acid soils may develop over hard, massive, limestone lying only a few inches below the surface. Similarly, shallow podzols can be observed on deep soils over chalk in the Chilterns. In some situations the calcareous base rock (the solid geology) may be overlain by other material of different origin and composition, e.g. may be a layer of non-calcareous drift over a calcareous base rock and in this case, the soil’ profile will be determined by the superficial material. Within a given site, the depth of superficial deposit may vary so that a mosaic of types is produced. Even where larger fragments of limestone are well distributed in the profile, their effect may be quite localised with no free calcium carbonate in most of the material (pH <7). Such soils belong to the podzolic group. It will be appreciated from the above discussion that the soil forming or pedological processes are essentially dynamic, and most of the soils you will meet in the field will be immature and undergoing changes of one sort or another, which means they will often be transitional between the classical textbook descriptions. if The use of the mattock and/or trowel to dig a small sloping pit is described in the main text. The auger can be used to investigate the lower levels. The first thing to do is dig a small pit about 30 cm deep if this is possible (i.e. the soil is not too rocky or shallow). Having filled in the attributes 1-4 Site Na, Plot No., etc. at the top of the form, the best procedure is to continue working down the profile (and form) interpreting on the way. Each section of the form deals with a single named horizon (with the exception of the B horizon which is the Bl and B2 horizon combined). Having decided that a particular horizon is present according to the methods of interpretation and definitions given below, the appropriate section of the form should be completed starting with depth from/to({cm). The from/to method is used instead of simple depth = thickness to avoid cumulative errors in scaling of the profile. Where horizon limits are irregular or poorly defined an average or best approximation should be given. Only in C Underlying Material, is the depth given as from, and if this value is not the soil depth, in terms of auger penetration, this should be given separately in brackets. Methods of determining, and the definitions of, the other attributes are given in their appropriate sections below. If a given horizon is not present it should be deleted by a diagonal line and not applicable = N.A. written across it. Aoo Litter Layer (identifiable plant remains ) This is quite straightforward, either there are plant remains, and they can be identified from their appearance or by inference from the vegetation, or there are not. Whether there is or is not a layer of identifiable plant remains at the soil surface and its depth, is the first major clue as to the nature of the profile (i.e. the pedological process that is dominant ) :- (i) If there is no Aoo horizon or a shallow one, thas’ 36 indicative of a MULL humus type and soil profile in which there will probably be no, or a very shallow Ao hotizen; a> + or >= well developed Al horizon, no A2 horizon, and no deposition layer in the B horizon. (ii) If there is a well developed Aoo, several cm in depth, then this is indicative of a MOR humus type and a soil profile in which there is likely to be a well developed Ao horizon, no or a poorly developed Al horizon, there may be a well developed A2 horizon and there may be a deposition layer in the B horizon. Intermediate or MODER humus types are quite common, resulting in an intermediate profile type. Composition - attributes 6-13 are all self-explanatory, more than one may be recorded and normally this will be the case. Aco Organic Layer (decomposed plant remains with little or no mineral soil) As explained above this may be very shallow, of vires ioh~ existent, or it may occupy the whole of the rest of the profile with no other recordable horizons; in other words, deep peat. The presence or absence of mineral material can be tested by _ rubbing a sample between the fingers or on the palm of the hand, when mineral particles will normally be felt. Da = Having decided whether or not there is an Ao horizon delete or record. Texture - attributes 15-17, needs little explanation. Pulling the material apart will detect whether it is 15 fibrous (do not mistake live roots for fibres, dead ones are legitimate) and breaking in the fingers will decide whether it is 16 granular or 17 amorphous. Moisture - attributes 18-21, should be decided as follows :~ 18 v wet - dripping with water without squeezing. 19 wet - water expressed on squeezing. 20 damp - obviously containing appreciable water but none expressed on squeezing. 2k ary -. looks and feels reasonably dry. Al Mixed Mineral/Organic Layer (humus masking colour of mineral soil) Again, the first thing to do is decide if this horizon is present OX DOL. = (i) If there is a well developed Ai horizon there will be little or no distinction between the Aoo, Ao and Al layers, the profile grading almost imperceptibly from organic? to’ organic/ mineral mixed soil (this is a true brown earth or brown forest soil). In this case, the humus content will gradually decrease with depth, the soil paling from dark brown to.a tighter colour as the true mineral colour of the soil is révealed by decreasing humus content. The actual boundary may be difficult to see and may be <40-50 cm in depth. On the other hand, the Al horizon may be poorly developed, shallow and exhibiting a + or - sharp transition with the mineral soil below. Common sense, colour and rubbing sample _ between the fingers will decide this. (ii) If immediately beneath the Ao horizon there is a much paler, often white or greyish, layer with no organic matter in it (if there were organic matter it would be black or brown), then there is indeed no Al horizon and what you are looking at is an A2 horizon (this is a true podzol). Difficulties may arise in wet soils but this will usually occur in boggy areas (due to local drainage conditions) or on very heavy clay soils. Both these contingencies will be fairly obvious. In these cases water level, and the seasonal changes thereof, will be affecting the profile by producing aiternate aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Where this is taking place in mineral soil, deposition of iron oxides on the structural units of the soil.will occur. Breaking the soil between the fingers will reveal alternating pale and ocherous patches. If there is evidence of organic matter in this layer, it must be regarded as a gleyed Al (and recorded appropriately) if not then it is On = a gleyed B horizon (also to be recorded appropriately). Both gleyed Al and B horizons will occur together in some profiles. If the Al has a high organic content, (but an appreciable quantity of mineral material must still be present} as may occur in boggy areas, the signs of mottling will not be visible. In this case it will be recorded as dark coloured (brown or black), wet or ve wet Al. Having decided whether or not an Al horizon is present, delete or record. Transition with mineral soil - attributes 23 and 24, have already been discussed above and should now be obvious. Texture - attributes 25-28, can be decided as follows:~- Roll a sample on the palm of the hand, wetting with spit if necessary. If it can be rolled into a coherant sausage it is either clay or silt. 25 (Glay - if a sausage about 10 cm (4\") long can be bent into a complete circle without breaking (must of’ course be sufficiently moistened) it is clay. 26 Silt - if the sausage breaks it is silt. 27 Sand - aif it cannot be rolled into a sausage it is sand. 28 Stony - unless almost pure gravel will normally be recorded as well as one of the attributes 25-27. Must be >10% stones of any size to count. Structure - attributes 29-31, refers to the compounding of the primary particles (sand, silt or clay) into aggregates. Breaking of the soil between the finger will reveal if such aggregates occur. 29 Powder - aggregates non-existent or very weak (coarse sands will usually exhibit this condition but other soils as well). 30 Crumb - aggregates, as the name suggests, like crumbs from : a loaf of bread. 31 iGlod - aggregates large and adherent, often breaking in more.or less flat sided lumps up to several cm in length. Usually occur only on soils with a high silt -or,claycontent. Colour - attributes 32-35, self-explanatory. If the*¢6liour is markedly different from black, brown or possibly reddish-brown, then you have probably incorrectly identified this layer as’ Al, because the humus which must be present mixed with the mineral soil, being itself black or brown, will be masking other mineral colours. oe 7, = 35 mottled, has been adequately described above as indicating alternate aerobic/anaerobic conditions as a result of impeded drainage. Most commonly found in silts or clays. Moisture - attributes 36-39 as for the Aco horizon. A2 Leached or Eluviated Layer (bleached mineral soil) The identification of this horizon has already been discussed at some length in connection with the Ao and Al layers. Normally there will be a very sharp transition of the Ao with a paler layer of soil, usually showing a whitish or greyish colour, but it may be speckled with black humus fragments. Beneath this leached layer the soil will be much more brightly coloured again (= B horizon), and in extreme cases will have intensely coloured, horizontal zonation of black and/or reddish-brown colour. The black is humus deposition and the reddish-brown oxides of iron. A closer examination will reveal that these materials have been deposited on the surface of the soil particles, (sand grains or pebbles). In the majority of cases, particularly in western Britain, the A2 will merely be underlain by a fairly uniforn, bright red or reddish-brown layer which again is the B horizon but with generalised, rather than localised, deposition of iron oxides. Many of these soils are only incipient podzols and no distinct) A2 horizon will be visible, the profile passing from a sharply.defined Ao, through a brownish layer to the much brighter B horizon. In this case it will be necessary to record what, although it is an incipient A2, as an Al horizon (small quantities of humus are indeed present in this layer). Having decided whether an Al horizon is present or not delete or record. Colour - attributes 40 and 41 have already been explained above. Must be one or other of these colours to be an A2. Texture - as above for the Al horizon. Is.very unlikely to be clay of course, as the processes leading to the development of an A2 requires both low. base status and free drainage. Note, that neither structure nor moisture are recorded for this layer as these will invariably be powdery (i.e. no aggregates) and damp or dry, respectively, almost by definition. B Weathered Mineral Layer (Bl and B2 combined) The B horizon is commonly divided into two layers, the Bl deposition layer and the B2 weathered mineral soil. For the purposes of this survey they are being grouped together. As explained above the Bl can consist of local or more generalised deposition of humic or iron materials. A deposition layer is only to be recorded as present if it is of the localised variety with distinct horizontal (may be somewhat wavy) zonation.. .If present, record attributes 48-51, if not, delete and write N.A. on this sub-group of attributes. = Colour - attributes 48 and 49 are self-explanatory. Compaction - attributes 50 and 51, pick at the layer with a finger tip, if it is hard, record compacted, if not uncompacted. Texture - attributes 52-55, as Al above. Colour - (other than deposition layer) attributes 56-60, as Al above. Structure - attributes 61-63, as Al above. Moisture - attributes 64-67, as Ao above. C Underlying Material This may or may” not be the parent material of the soil and for the purposes of this survey it will not be necessary to determine whether this is the case. The term underlying material refers to whatever lies under the lowest of the overlying horizons that has been recorded fora given profile. Most commonly it will refer to the material that is immediately under the B horizon but in other cases it may be the Al or Ao horizons, but not the A2 horizon which will always have some sort of B horizon beneath aoe On deep soils it may not be possible to determine the depth or nature of the underlying material since investigations will be ‘limited to the length of auger (about 70 cm) plus the depth of the hole (i.e. about. 80 cm at the limit). In this case the lower limit of the overlying horizon will be given as 75 cm + and the section on underlying material deleted and TOO DEEP written , BEXOSS TC é The most common problem will be determining the transition between the B horizon and the underlying material, and indeed there may be no marked division if the soil matrix is deep and uniform. Generally, the underlying material should be taken as commencing from where there is no further colour change (usually a gradual paling) in the B horizon. Other cases will be quite clear, with +he B or some other horizon lying immediately on the top of some quite different material such as fragmentary or solid rock, gravel, clay etc. If the depth to which the auger can be inserted in the pit is less than 70 cm this should be recorded separately in a’ bracket () immediately beneath attribute 47. The ‘Only’ attributes to. be recorded for this horizon are Texture - attributes 69-74. The first four of these are as previously described for the Al horizon, to which has been added 73 Rock (fragments) and 74 Rock (solid). These are self-explanatory and both can be recorded if necessary. Pe Rocks in’ Soii Refers to stones or rocks anywhere in the profile from surface to underlying material. 9. = Shape % - attributes (variables) 75-77, record approximate %, self-explanatory; rounded = really rounded, sub-angular = “angular with the corners knocked off, angular - sharp corners. Size range % - attributes (variables) 78-81, self-explanatory. Composition % - attributes 82-89, very much depends on how good you are at identifying rocks. Scratching with a knife or breaking with the mattock may assist in identification. Lf <a doubt, retain samples of main types and send samples in with soil in separate bags clearly labelled. Also add note to field sheet to this effect. Comments Earthworms - attribute 90, if you see any earthworms whilst digging the profile or observe earthworm burrows or casts record as present. Any comments can be added on the reverse side of the form. In cases. of extreme difficulty or doubt in the interpretation of a profile, draw a fully annotated diagram of the horizons observed and their various characteristics, on the back of the form. Disturbed profiles (excavation, ploughing, etc.), buried profiles, newly layed alluvium and soils on steep slopes with rapid erosion, may all present rather atypical horizons or total lack of same. Skeletal or immature soils may also have very limited horizon development. Watch out for all of these. Two sample forms are attached as an example, showing the method of filling in two common profile types:- A = a deep brown earth. B = a slightly devéloped podzol.

Instructions on methods of survey and recording 1.1. General You will be supplied with the necessary site and plot location maps, recording sheets and soil sampling bags and boxes before leaving Merlewood. A check list of all equipment is given in Appendix V. CEH can lend girth tapes for DBH measurement and sighting poles for slope or tree height measurement if necessary. In any event all survey teams should use the same methods. Woods will be located using a list of grid references and names for each woodland site, an A4 extract from the relevant 1:50,000 OS map (plus, wherever possible, a copy of the original 21⁄2” map) showing the location of each site and an enlarged copy of the site sketch map showing the locations of each of the 16 plot locations that need to be re-recorded (from either the 1:50, 000 or 2 1⁄2” map please check carefully as this will affect locating plots). Having located the site the first important thing is obtaining PERMISSION to enter and survey the site in question. 1.2. Access and Permission to Survey Sites It will be the responsibility of the surveyors to obtain permission to survey the woods. The contractors will provide such information as they hold but for some woods there will be no known owner and this will need to be established on the ground. Once you have established ownership, record names and addresses with the survey results on the back of the Site Description sheet. You MUST obtain permission to access the land. Experience from Pilot Woodland Re-survey and the Countryside Survey 2000 fieldwork showed that, in the majority of cases, land-owners could be identified and permissions secured in half a day even with multiple owners. There were very few cases where land-owners refused permission to survey their land. Most are fascinated by the fact that records existed from 1971 and that these records could be accurately updated. In order to ease negotiations you will be provided with a letter of introduction explaining the background to the survey. You can also assure any landowner that they will receive a complete copy of the results (1971 and 2002) for their parcel of land. This is also why it is crucial to note down addresses and contact numbers for each site. 1.3. Location of the Sampling Points A map will be provided that is marked with the 16 random sampling points (numbered 1-16). Locating these points on the ground is an extremely critical part of the survey procedure upon which much else depends. There are two important factors in locating the points: i) Accuracy ii) Absence of subjective bias (i.e. not exercising choice) In practice, high accuracy is not possible without resorting to time-consuming methods. However a reasonable degree of accuracy is required if plot and map derived datasets are to be compatible, since certain information about the plots (altitude, slope position, measures of exposure etc.) will be taken from the map. Three maps will be provided: (i) 1:50 for location, (ii) a photocopy of the original 21⁄2” with plot locations and (ii) expanded version of the same. PLEASE NOTE that the contours on the 21⁄2” map are in 25 foot intervals and the original 1971 instructions to surveyors were that 1/32nd of an inch = 22 yards. If you have a metric map, or wish to work in metres, you will have to convert all distances and slopes accordingly. 3 There are no permanent markers for each plot as absolute reference points to determine the accuracy of relocation. A degree of re-location error is expected given the lack of permanent markers but our experience in the pilot survey shows that the following re-location procedure performs substantially better than analysis of repeat records from a newly randomised set of locations. More important is the avoidance of bias. Such considerations as, “this bit is not very typical”, or, “we had a bit like this last time, we will walk on another 10 paces, it looks better there”, must be avoided at all costs. Taking short or long paces in order to avoid a blackthorn thicket or nettle bed is an equally serious crime as is the location of plots in situations judged to be in any sense ‘homogenous’. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE USE OF GPS TO LOCATE PLOTS IS DISCOURAGED. THIS MAY BRING YOU CLOSER TO THE 1971 MAPPED PLOT LOCATION BUT MAY NOT NECESSARILY BRING YOU CLOSER TO WHERE THE PLOT WAS ACTUALLY RECORDED. BECAUSE GPS WAS NOT USED IN 1971 ITS USE IN 2003 COULD INTRODUCE BIAS. 1.4. Relocation approach: The approach will be to pace out along a compass bearing having derived a distance and angle from the plot location map. Each enlarged map has one complete side of a 1 km square marked on it. This will allow you to scale between distance on the map and distance on the ground e.g. 1 mm = 10 m on a 1:10,000 map. Please note, plot location maps have been enlarged to different extents to increase the clarity of the plot locations so you will need to work out a map-to-ground correspondence separately for each plot location map. Bear in mind that the sites may have altered significantly over 30 years. Collect soil samples and record the vegetation even if the plot is no longer woodland. Only do not record if it is built- over. We know that at least one site has been bisected by a motorway since 1971. Dramatic changes in land-use may have affected other sites as well. Do not attempt to record plots that now fall into land you have no permission to survey but DO make a note of the change in use. In particular, do not record plots on used railway embankments or motorway verges. Be sensible and stay alive! 1.5. Order of Recording the Data One site description and habitat form must be completed for each site and three sets of data (each with its own recording form) and one soil sample must be collected from each plot. We recommend you use clutch pencils to fill in all recording forms. They do not need sharpening and since all forms will be printed onto waterproof paper, pencil will be preferable to pen if it is raining. An example of each recoding form is given in Appendix IV. The vegetation plot for ground flora should be recorded first so that it is surveyed in a relatively undisturbed state. The remaining recording can then be carried out in the most manageable order. Recording Forms for each dataset (a) Vegetation plot. Ground Flora - presence and absence in five successively increasing quadrat sizes up to the full 14.14 x 14.14 m, with % cover/abundance estimates for the largest of these. Major common bryophytes should be recorded but a full list is not expected (see below). Site description and habitats - mostly presence and absence of attributes. (b) 4 (c) (d) Trees, saplings and shrubs - trees, DBH (cm) and species from all four quarters of a 14.14 x 14.14 m plot (200 m2), the same data for saplings and shrubs from a pair of diagonally opposite quarters 1 and 3 of the plot. Plot description and habitat data - mostly presence and absence of attributes, from the same 14.14 x 14.14 m plot. Samples (i) A soil sample dug from each plot to be obtained at the same time as the plot survey. The methods of setting out the plots and the collecting and recording of the data are now dealt with in detail. 2. Recording of Plot Data There are four recording forms for the following categories. The Appendix provides further details on individual categories and classifications. 2.1. Vegetation plot: Ground Flora The first operation when the plot centre has been located, is to lay out the plot. The four corner posts delineate the largest 14.14 x 14.14 m (200 m2) plot. The plot should be located so that the diagonal strings, and hence corners of the plot, are orientated along cardinal compass points. Spaced along each of the distance strings are four coloured markers that give the half-diagonal distances of the four smaller plots (see Figure 2). Starting with the smallest 2 x 2 m plot, the area within is carefully searched recording the presence of all ground flora species - all vascular plants (monocots, dicots, and ferns) - including tree or shrub seedlings <25 cm in height. A record of the presence of species in this innermost quadrat are made by inserting a 1 in the column headed Q on the vegetation plot recording sheet and in the row corresponding to the species concerned (see Appendix II). If the species is not listed then pencil in the entry in the blank rows under ‘Other species’ at the bottom of the sheet. Plants which cannot be immediately identified, or for which a subsequent check, in flora or herbarium, is required, should be placed in a labelled paper bag. Having recorded all species in a given quadrat size, the new area enclosed by the next successive set of markers is searched for additional species only. This procedure is repeated until the full 14.14 x 14.14 m (200 m2) has been recorded. The most convenient method of search for the successive sizes of quadrat is for the two operators to spiral outwards moving in opposite directions so that both cover the whole area. Record successive quadrats by inserting the quadrat number (2 to 5) in the Q column; as for quadrat 1. Because of identification difficulties, only the common major bryophytes growing on the soil should be recorded (not on tree bases, logs, rocks or other specialised habitats). A list of these is given in Appendix I. Having completed the record of presence of the vascular plants in all five quadrat sizes, an estimate of cover abundance for the full plot (14.14 x 14.14 m) should be made and inserted next to each species in any one of the two columns headed % (see Appendix II). This should include all vascular plants plus tree/shrub seedlings recorded as present, plus the six additional categories (litter, wood, rock, bare ground, water and bryophytes). Estimates should be given to the nearest 5% only. Species present in appreciable quantity (either in area occupied or number of individuals, if widely scattered), but with less than 5% cover, should be recorded as 1. Those present as only single or few specimens with little cover should be 5 recorded as +. The total cover should add up to ca. 100% (making due allowance for the +’s and 1's), or more if the ground flora is markedly layered. Note that tree and shrub canopy cover is not included as the canopy composition and age-class distribution is recorded instead. 2.2. Trees, saplings and shrubs These are recorded in the 14.14 x 14.14 m plot, the laying out of which has already been described in (a) above. Decisions as to whether individuals are in the plot, or not, are based on rooted base being 50% or more within the plot. (i) Trees are defined as stems of >5 cm DBH of any species which is normally capable of attaining a tree like habit. Exceptions include Hazel, Blackthorn, Viburnum spp., Juniper and other shrubs, which rarely produce stems >5 cm diameter anyway. The 6 Distance string position from centre - 1/2 diagonal Q1 = 4 m2 quadrat (2 m x 2 m) = 1.42 m diagonal Q2 = 25 m2 (5.00 x 5.00 m) = 3.54 m Q3 = 50 m2 (7.07 x 7.07 m) = 5.00 m Q4 = 100 m2 (10.00 x 10.00 m) = 7.07 m Q5 = 200 m2 (14.14 x 14.14 m) = 10.00 m Not to scale Figure 2 LAYOUT OF VEGETATION PLOT Quarter No 1 (NE) Quarter No 4 (NW) Quarter 3 (SW) 1.42m Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5 Marker tags Corner post Quarter No 2 (SE) Centre post and right angle gauge Q1 10.00m 7.07 m 5.00 m 3.54 m species and DBH (cm) of all stems in the whole plot over 5 cm diameter is measured (recording by quarters of the plot). Trees with multiple stems have each stem measured and recorded separately but these are bracketed together on the recording sheet (see Appendix III). Dead trees (standing of course) or dead stems on multi-stemmed trees, are designated by a capital “D” in the top right-hand corner of the cell in which its diameter is recorded. (ii) Saplings - tree species, with the same definition as (i), but with a height >130 cm (ie over breast height) but <5 cm DBH are recorded only in the diagonally opposite quarters 1 and 3. Quarter 1 is always the NE quadrant. Quarter 3 is always the SW quadrant (see Figure 2). The same measurements as for trees, species and DBH (cm), are recorded for these with the same conventions for multi-stemmed and dead trees or stems. (iii) Shrubs - as defined above according to species. Like the saplings these are only recorded in the diagonally opposite quarters 1 and 3; same data, same conventions. The final job is to measure the height of the largest tree in the plot (the tree with the largest DBH - regardless of species). It is recommended that you use an Abney hand level, clinometer or hygrometer. If provided with a hygrometer please use this in preference. Failing this you MUST calibrate your preferred method against the hygrometer and detail the calibration in the record sheets. Whichever method is used always ensure that your horizontal distance is taken along the same contour: the slope should be zero between the observer and the base of tree. If this proves impossible then you must record the ground slope so that a correction can be made later. In the eventuality of the largest tree being in some way atypical (i.e. top broken off) the next largest should be substituted. An example of a completed recording form is given in Appendix III. (1) Height Measurement with a clinometer Insert the horizontal distance and angle to the top of the tree next to the relevant individual on the DBH data sheet (see Appendix III). Note you will have to insert the horizontal distance between observer and tree plus the angle to treetop. The actual height will then be calculated in the spreadsheets you will use for data entry after the survey. (2) Height Measurement with a hypsometer If these are available then instructions will be provided following training on the field course 7 Use a clinometer to measure the angle between ground and tree topto give Xo. XoHorizontal distance on level ground (H)Tree height = (Tan (Xo) x H) + height from ground to eye level Plot description and habitats 2.3. These are recorded on the basis of presence within the 14.14 x 14.14 m plot by striking out the appropriate attributes on the form. The object of this form is to obtain frequency data about important attributes that can reasonably be expected to occur a measurable number of times within a single site. A detailed account of methods and definitions of the attributes is given in Appendix IV (the second number in brackets referring to the plot form attributes). In the case of attributes that have an appreciable defined area, e.g. ponds, glades, etc., only part of the full area needs to be in the plot for it to be recorded as present. For example if only part of a glade 50 m across occurred actually within the plot it would be recorded as present and attribute 76 struck off. The comments column can be used to record any information that is not included elsewhere and is considered relevant or useful in interpretation. Soil sampling 2.4. The objective is to obtain a composite soil sample from each plot. Soil samples are to be taken from the centre of each plot or as near as possible (not more than 1 m distant). Each sample bag must have a self-adhesive label stuck on indicating site and plot (labels provided ideally done when the bag is dry before starting fieldwork). Wherever possible, bags should also be marked using a permanent marker in the field after the soil sample has been collected on the bag itself, showing site and plot. Unknown soil samples results in the loss of data hence double labeling to reduce such error. Soil samples are to be taken from the top 15 cm of the soil using a trowel. Before taking the sample, check for fresh plant litter (green) on the surface of the soil. Carefully remove this to expose the layer of decomposing plant material below. If in doubt include in the sample for later removal at CEH. If the area is rocky remove the largest rocks to expose the soil surface. If there is more rock that soil move to another area (within 1 m distance). If difficulties in obtaining sufficient sample are encountered, then supplement from nearest possible point in the plot, (again within 1 m distance) but ensuring to sample the top 15 cm of soil again. Should this occur, a note to this effect should be appended to the data form. The hole should be filled in and roughly disguised before leaving the plot - this is important. Record any problems/changes in soil sampling on the plot form. The sample should be a representative sample of the entire 0 to 15 cm of soil and fill ca. 3⁄4 of the bag, wherever possible. Bags are all self-sealing, so when filled, seal to keep air-tight and prevent loss of soil. All soil sample bags should be kept in the plastic boxes corresponding to each site (marked using the self-adhesive labels) and stored in a cool place until returned to CEH Merlewood. 8 2.5. Completion of the Plot Having filled in all data recording forms and collected all necessary samples, the recording of the plots is now complete. At this point it is advisable to: (i) check that all forms have been fully entered make a quick check to see that major items have not been omitted, and that the site, plot number and date of survey have been correctly entered at the top of each form. (ii) Check all the samples into your rucksack. (iii) Check all the equipment into your rucksack. (iv) Check the soil sampling area has been filled in. (v) Take one last quick look round the plot to see that nothing important has been omitted and no equipment left behind. The data you are collecting is being collected “forever”. Make sure that it is comprehensive and correct to the best of your ability even at the expense of taking a little extra time. One additional set of data has to be collected for the site as a whole (i.e. comprising the plots and the ground in-between), namely site description and habitats for the whole site - separate but similar form to that for the plot. 3. Site Description and Habitats Recording forms 3.1 A detailed description of how this data should be collected and recorded on the form and definitions for all attributes is given in Appendix IV (attribute numbers not in brackets). Coverage is of the whole site, both within and between plots. In order to record section L (Marginal Land Use) and M (Boundary Type) it will almost certainly be necessary to walk round all or part of the boundary. Useful information can also be obtained from the site map. Please make full use of comments section to note any features may help in the interpretation of change. Also make sure you record any information gleaned from conversation with the land-owner, although such anecdotal information will not be consistently recorded it can help when interpreting change. Since surveyors are required to draft brief pen sketches of each site, it will be in your interest to complete the plot and site descriptor sheets in the field. Completion of the Site 3.1 When the whole site has been completed (4 sets of data and 2 sets of samples for 16 plots, plus the site description sheet) all the sheets should be stapled together in plots, checked for completeness and put back into the cardboard site folder ready for data entry. 9 4. Soil dispatch to Merlewood When all 16 soil samples from each plot are in the plastic box, you are now ready to dispatch to CEH Merlewood. An address label is supplied to be taped to each box when ready for dispatch. Options for returning samples are: delivery by hand if you are in the area; courier; recorded delivery next day post; collection by CEH (when this is local or near a CEH station). Options for sample return will be finalised in discussion with surveyors at the field course. Each survey team should, ideally ensure that samples are sent so that they arrive at CEH Merlewood within the week they are sampled. Please remember that CEH Merlewood is closed over the weekend so courier/post will not be delivered to CEH Merlewood on a Saturday or Sunday. It is much better to keep the samples until the following week in a cool place than send them on a Friday when they could end up sitting somewhere hot for two days. 10 Appendix Ia - List of top 25 most common bryophytes recorded from Pilot woodland sites APPPENDIX BRC code 8201214 820599 820507 8101308 8201147 820395 820382 820351 820463 820206 820346 820532 820533 820534 8201243 820203 8201110 820592 820374 8204 810867 820402 810827 820335 82042 BRC names Polytrichum sp.

The Plot Description and Habitat Form is a somewhat reduced version of the Site Form and one is completed for each plot (i.e. 16 per site). For simplicity in the subsequent handling of the data, the code numbers for the attributes are different on the two forms, the attributes being numbered sequentially on each form without gaps, except for unallocated codes. Since the methods of recording and definitions of attributes remain the same on the two forms it is possible to treat them together by giving both code number series - site code first unbracketed, and plot code second in brackets ( ). Checking that all the appropriate attributes for a given plot have been recorded is part of the routine procedure dealt with in the main text. A further check should, however, be made that there are no logical inconsistencies between the plot and site forms; attributes which are present on the plot form must be present on the site form (but not necessarily vice versa). If any significant area of the site has not been covered in connection with locating or recording the plots (or for other purposes) it should be briefly visited to check that no attributes have been missed. Particular care should be taken with the site form as the recording of a given attribute is an all or nothing proposition and is therefore critical. The attribute code numbers are dealt with in order below: (SE = self-explanatory; and UA = unallocated). 1 2 3 4 A. 5 6 7 8 (7) Site Number - SE Plot number - SE, on site form fill in as 1 -16 (1) (2) (3) Recorder - recorder's initials (4) Date - day, month, year. Inclusive dates on site form. (5) Slope - (plot only) in _ or %. Depends on the instrument provided - Blume Leiss = _, Haga = %. (See main text for methods). Aspect - _ magnetic, SE (See main text for methods). (6) Trees - Management Planted hardwoods - must be clear evidence that the trees have been planted, eg visible lines, uniform age and/or, in the case of mixtures, regular alternation of species. Gets more difficult to detect planted origin with age. Planted conifers - these can usually be assumed to be planted except in the case of European larch and Scots pine, unless there is strong evidence to the contrary, eg irregular distribution and age. May be natural regeneration of some species. Pollards - trees that have had their main branch systems cut off at some time at a height above breast height (4'3\" or 130 cm) but have now resprouted. An ancient method of marking boundaries or obtaining firewood and/or browse for stock. Coppice stools - trees that have been cut off below breast height and have resprouted. Most multi-stemmed trees are the result of coppicing but not all. Usually the point of cutting can be seen and there are usually 15 >2 stems. Hazel stools should not be recorded as coppice stools unless there are unmistakable cut stems to be seen; a multi-stemmed growth form is normal for this species. Many woods all over Britain, but particularly in the south, were formerly managed on a coppicing system. Most coppice origin woods have not been cut for 20, 50 or even more years and have grown on so that their former use is less evident (but see attribute 10 (9)). Singled coppice - where, in what was formerly coppice, with a preponderance of multi-stemmed trees, selected stools have had the number of shoots reduced to one by cutting the others off. This can be detected by the swollen base of the tree with scars where the other main shoots were removed or by the presence of residual twiggy growth. Becomes less detectable with time. Recently cut coppice - where there is evidence that coppicing is still, or has been until very recently, in progress. Recent coppice can be detected from cut shoot stubs on the stools and/or the presence of coppice produce (see also 20) in the wood. Recent - <c 5 years. Mature conifers - trees >40 years old or >20 m height. Stumps hardwood new - hardwood stumps can usually be distinguished from conifers by the presence of ring-porous wood and/or medullary rays. Often the remnants of bark can be used to identify the hardwood species, eg oak, ash, birch. New stumps can be distinguished from old 13 (11) by the absence of advance rot, luxuriant growths or bryophytes and by the fact that the ring growth is still discernible without cutting or scraping the stump. Stumps hardwood old - the inverse of the characters used to identify new stumps in 12 (10) above. Stumps of species like birch rot away completely in a very short time, whilst those of more resistant species like oak persist for many (>50) years, so the old/new scale is necessarily arbitrary. Stumps conifer new - conifer stumps can be distinguished from hardwoods by the absence of ring-porous wood or medullary rays. Identifiable bark is often useful, as also is resin exudation, and the smell of resin if reasonably fresh. Apart from Sequoias (not very likely) NO conifers produce any coppice shoots from stumps cut near the ground. So if there are any signs of coppice shoots live or dead it is sure to be hardwood. the same rules for new/old hardwood stumps also apply to conifers. Yew coppices quite frequently but is easy to identify. Stumps conifer old - fully explained above, SE. Stumps overgrown - in the more open woodlands, the older stumps in an advance state of decay will often be completely overgrown by such species as bramble, honeysuckle or bryophytes. Brashing/pruning - where the lower branches of the trees have been artificially removed by cutting to improve access and/or timber quality. Brash heaps - can result from brashing or pruning, or from the cutting of scrub species, or as the lop and top (the thinner branches) of felled trees. Essentially, therefore, a heap of thin branches which have been left to rot. Cord wood - odds and ends of felled trees, almost invariably hardwood, which have been cut to log size (as for putting on the fire) and have been piled into regular stacks (usually about 4'-6' high and 2'-3' wide and any length). 16 9 (8) 10 (9) 11 12 (10) 13 (11) 14 (12) 15 (13) 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 (14) Coppice sticks - the product from cutting coppice which has been tidily stacked for subsequent use. Can vary from large sizes such as hop poles down to pea sticks. Stack timber - the larger parts of the stems of felled trees which have been cut into regular lengths (3' up to 30' or 40') and stacked. Anything from pulp bolts up to the largest sizes in saw timber. Felled trees - trees that have been felled but have not been processed any further than having had the branches cut off. Chips/sawdust - SE Fire sites - SE, often used to get rid of brash 18. Paint/blaze marks - used to mark trees for some special purpose; often for felling, retaining or thinning out the surrounding trees in favour of the best trees. Paint marks may consist of dots, rings or even numbers. Blaze marks consist of the bark being cut off in a strip at about breast height. The latter almost invariably means the tree is marked for felling. Also include scribe marks. Extraction routes - places where logs have obviously been dragged or strips of trees removed for the same purpose. Vehicle tracks - the use of vehicles on unmade ground off the main roads or tracks (see also attributes 114-118 (79-82)). UA B. Trees - Regeneration 29-48 (15-34) (as per species listed) - regeneration is any tree species >25cm height and <5cm DBH and must be of seedling origin. The only exception (ie non- tree) is hazel which must of course be >25 cm in height but must also be of obvious, recent, seedling origin (do not record coppice shoots - upper limit of 5 cm hardly applies here). Coppice shoots are not to be recorded as regeneration and care should be taken to check this point as far as possible. Younger seedlings, <25 cm height, will be recorded by plots as a part of the ground flora. Regeneration over breast height will similarly be recorded in more detail with the saplings. Trees - Dead (= Habitats) C. 49 50 51 52 (35) 53 (36) 54 (37) 55 (38) 56 (39) Live/Dead - trees which, although still alive, have substantial dead parts on them, >50%. Standing dead <10 cm diameter - SE. Standing dead >10 cm diameter - SE. Fallen broken - trees dead, or recently alive, which have fallen and are lying on or near the ground due to the main trunk breaking. Includes trees that have been felled and abandoned. Must be <10 cm diameter at widest point - does not include very small trees. Fallen uprooted - as for 52 but uprooted with a mass of soil and roots pulled out of the ground leaving a hole. Must be >10 cm diameter again. Log very rotten - a very old version of 52 (35) or 53 (36), the sort you can kick into with your boot (with no broken toes). Must be >10 cm diameter again. Fallen branch >10 cm diameter - SE. Hollow trees - as indicated by large holes in base or higher up, SE. 17 57 (40) 58 (41) 59 (42) 60 Rot hole - smaller holes <25 cm diameter where branches have fallen off or the tree has been damaged in some way. In general not large or deep enough to indicate the tree is hollow. Stump <10 cm diameter - hardwood or conifer of any age and state of decay. Stump >10 cm diameter - as for 58 (41) apart from size. UA. D. Trees - Epiphytes and Lianes 61 (43) 62 (44) 63 (45) 64 (46) 65 (47) 66 (48) 67 68 69 71 72 Bryophytes base - <50 cm height SE. Bryophytes trunk - >50 cm height, trunk referring to primary structural members(s) of tree. Bryophytes branch - no height or diameter limitations, branch referring to secondary (and lesser) structural members of tree. Lichen trunk - as 62 (44) above. Refers to foliose lichens only (not the less conspicuous granular types). SE. Lichen branch - as 63 (45) above. SE. Fern - ferns growing anywhere on the tree. Mistletoe - SE Clematis - must ascend at least into the lower crown of trees to be counted. Ivy - as for 68 SE. Macrofungi - growing anywhere on tree from base to crown. Includes both mushroom and bracket-shaped types. UA. E. Habitats - Rock 73 (51) 74 (52) 75 (53) 76 (54) 77 (55) 78 (56) 79 (57) 80 (58) Stones <5 cm - as with all attributes in this group, must be on the surface of the ground, otherwise SE. Rocks 5-50 cm - SE. Boulders >50 cm - SE. Scree - the essential characteristics of a scree is its actual or potential mobility, thus distinguishing it from a rock pile (attribute 82 (62)). In order to exhibit this mobility a scree consists of a mass of rock fragments resting at or near the maximum angle or repose. The instability of a scree is conferred either by additions from above or active erosion at the base (possibly at high altitudes by the severe climatic regime). The minimum size for recording screes is 25 m2. Man-made screes produced by various earth-moving operations also count (see also 133 (87) and 134 (88)). Rock outcrop <5 m (height) - should be, as far as it is possible to tell, part of the solid geology. Height refers to vertical height (includes low angle outcrops such as limestone pavement). Cliff >5 m - a larger version of 77 (55). Rock ledges - horizontal surfaces of any size on rock outcrops or cliffs (77 (55) and 78 (56)). No width limits apply. Will usually be made very obvious by the presence of vegetation on the rock faces. Bryophyte covered rock - logically must record one or more of attributes 74 (52), 75 (53), 77 (55), and 78 (56) as well. Otherwise SE. 18 81 (59) 82 (60) 83 (61) 84 (62) Gully - where two rock faces or cliffs face one another. Must be at least 3 m in height and length and not more than 1.5 x their height apart. Logically must also record one or both of attributes 77 (55) and 78 (56) as well. Rock pile - as name suggests a pile of rocks, not less than 1 m in height and 2 m in diameter (see also 76 (54)). Logically must also record one or both attributes 74 (52) and 75 (53) as well. Exposed gravel or sand - must be at least 1 m2 in extent in one piece. Exposed mineral soil - must be at least 1 m2 in extent in one piece. F. Habitats - Aquatic 85 (63) 86 (64) 87 (65) 88 89 90 91 92 (66) (67) 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 (68) 100 (69) 101 (70) 102 (71) 103 (72) 104 (73 & 74) Small pool <1 m2 - must not be running water, otherwise SE. Pond 1-20 m2 - as for 85 (63) SE. Pond/lake >20 m2 - as for 85 (63) SE. Stream slow <1 m - speed less than 1 mph (very slow walking or 1 m/2 secs). Stream fast <1 m - speed over 1 mph. River slow 1-5 m speed as 88, SE. River fast 1-5 m - speed as 89, SE. River slow >5 m - speed as 88, SE. Stream/river slow (plot only) - as above but no size limits. Stream/river fast (plot only) - as below but no size limits. River fast >5 m - speed as 89, SE. Bottom rock - SE. Bottom gravel - SE. Bottom sand - SE. Bottom mud - if water turbid, may have to poke with a stick (if turbid most likely mud anyway). Bottom peat - SE. Aquatic vegetation - must be true water plants, not terrestrial plants submerged by an abnormally high water level. Spring - water emerging from ground, SE. Marsh/bog - water exuded under feet. Ditch/drain dry - may be wet at other times of year, SE. Ditch/drain wet - SE. - UA. G. Habitats - Open 105 106 107 108 109 Glade 5-12 m grass - in order to qualify must be an area of 5-12 m in two dimensions at right angles not covered by tree canopy (ie. Trees >130 cm) and with grass as the main vegetation type. A gap 8 x 4 m would not count but one 11 x 5 m would. Glade >12 m grass - same rules as 105 above, SE. Glade 5-12 m mixed - as for 1-5 but vegetation mixed, eg. Grass, herbs, brambles or even woody species <130 cm. Glade >12 m mixed - as 107 above, SE. Glade 5-12 m boggy - as for 105 but ground exuding water under foot. Vegetation can be any of the boggy types, eg. Rushes, Sphagnum, even grasses such as Molinia. Is distinguished from attributes 105-108 by wetness. 19 110 (75) (76) 111 (77) 112 (78) 113 114 (79) 115 (80) 116 (81) 117 (82) 118 119 & 120 Glade >12 m boggy - as for 109, SE. Glade 5-12 m (plot only) - as above but any vegetation type. Glade >12 m (plot only) - as above but any vegetation type. Rocky knoll <12 m (width) - consists of an area raised above the surrounding ground consisting largely of rocks with relatively little covering of soil. Rocky knoll >12 m - as 111 (77), SE. Field - a field is a definite management division, an area of ground being currently or having been in the past managed as a field. Normally there will be well marked boundaries with the wood - wall or fence, but these may be in poor repair. In order to count as being in the wood it must be at least partly within the survey boundary and enclosed on at least three sides by the wood. Path 1-5 m - not normally used by wheeled vehicles. Vegetated apart from a narrow trodden area. Ride >5 m - same as for 114 (79) but largely vegetated. Track non-prepared - quite extensively used by wheeled vehicles and therefore deeply rutted, vegetation being significantly affected by this use (>25% destroyed). Has not been the subject of large scale earth- moving operations nor has any metal (stones) been added to the surface. Track metalled - as for 116 (81) but earth-moving and/or addition of stone to surface used in construction. Road tarmac - must be within the site boundary SE. UA. H.

Marginal Land Use (<400 m distant) For some of these, e.g. Road, railway, river, etc. it will be possible to obtain correct records from the map. The map can also be used to pinpoint parts of the marginal land for which it will be necessary to check the use on the ground. It will be necessary to walk much of the boundary anyway to fill in section M. A good deal of navigation to determine the plot positions can make use of the boundary, thus economising in walking time. 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 Woodland hardwood - >75& hardwood < 25% conifers.

The samples were placed in the cold room until analyses could be started. Soil samples were sieved, removing all stones and vegetation (2 mm stainless steel mesh). Fresh (wet) pHs were done and then soil samples were oven dried at 25oC for approx. 1 week. After one week the samples were re-sieved if necessary and then out into labelled pots. Air-dry pHs and loss on ignitions were the carried out. pH Method 1. Calibrate the pH meter using buffer solutions of pH 4 and pH 7. 2. Add 10cm3 of the sample to a 50 ml beaker. 3. Add ~ 10ml of spectrum water (ultra pure) obtained from the Environmental Chemistry reservoir. 4. Mix thoroughly with a glass rod / spatula to a paste 5. Top up with spectrum water to the 50ml mark and stir. 6. Leave to stand for 20 minutes. 7. Stir. 8. Insert pH electrode. 9. Leave for a further five minutes. 10. Take pH reading and record result. 11. After each sample has been read, rinse electrode with pure water and touch-dry. Determination of air-dry moistures - loss of ignitions (LOIs) 1. Dry small crucible in small oven at 105oC. 2. Cool in dessicator 3. Weigh crucible and approx. 1g air-dry sieved sample (= W1 g) 4. Dry 3 hours at 105oC 5. Cool and weigh as before (= W2 g) 6. Place in muffle (ashing) at 550oC for 2 hours (allow 1⁄2 hour to reach 550oC) 7. Cool in dessicator and re-weigh (= W3 g) 8. Calculation Let (W2 -W1) oven dried = (W3-W1) muffle dried Then % dry matter = (W3-W1) x 100 (W2 -W1) 28 29 30\n",
      "Soil and vegetation radionuclide activity concentrations and calculated dose rates from the Red Forest, Chernobyl, Ukraine, 2016-2017 | Data comprise plot details and radionuclide activity concentrations for Sr-90, Cs-137, Am-241, Pu-238, Pu-239 and Pu-240 in âgrassyâ vegetation and soil. These radionuclide activity concentrations have been used to make estimations of total weighted absorbed doses to grassy vegetation, deciduous trees and bacteria; no dose rate estimates for grassy vegetation have been made for those sites where grassy vegetation was absent.Radiation from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident killed coniferous trees in a 4-6 km2 area of forest to the west of the power plant. This area is now known as the 'Red Forestâ and it has subsequently regenerated with understorey vegetation and deciduous trees; it is the most anthropogenically contaminated radioactive ecosystem on Earth. In July 2016 a severe fire burnt (to varying degrees) c. 80 percent of the Red Forest; this presented a unique opportunity to study the impact of radiation on the recovery of forest ecosystems exposed to a secondary stressor (fire). To investigate this, in September 2017 the RED FIRE project set up sixty study plots in the Red Forest (in burnt and unburnt areas) with a further nine plots established close to Buriakivka village (approximately 8 km from the Red Forest).Vegetation samples from each plot were harvested using shears in September 2017. Each sample was sorted into âgrassyâ and âotherâ vegetation; these were air-dried (20-25 degrees Celsius) and the grassy vegetation samples homogenised prior to radionuclide analyses.Soil core samples collected in September 2017 were bulked, homogenised and sub-samples taken for determination of pH and percentage moisture determined by oven drying (approximately 60 degrees Celsius) to a constant mass. The remaining soil sample was used for the determination of radionuclide activity concentrations; prior to analyses, these samples were dried at approximately 80 degrees Celsius.This work was funded by the NERC, Grant Ref: NE/P015212/1 (RED FIRE: Radioactive Environment Damaged by fire: a Forest In Recovery)Publication date: 2021-02-26 |\n",

Background and introduction This dataset maps the Input to Yield Ratio (IYR) of wheat farming in England, calculated as the ratio of agrochemical inputs to agricultural reward as yield. We assess the IYR at a 1km resolution for wheat grown in England over the period the period 2010-2017, considering the different agrochemicals used and their differing forms of environmental impact. We provide four mapped products: IYR for Nitrogen fertilisers, IYR for Phosphorus fertilisers, IYR for pesticide risk to earthworms, and IYR for pesticide risk to honeybees. The IYR is calculated using scaled rather than absolute values, with the maximum value in each yield and inputs dataset set as 1, so that all inputs and rewards are expressed proportionally to each other. The IYR dataset allows us to evaluate trade-offs between farming yields and agrochemical inputs at large spatial scales. It can inform targeting of actions to improve sustainability of arable farming, or locations where it is best to switch to other forms of farming or land uses such as ecosystem restoration (Bullock et al., 2023). Data description This dataset comprises four single-layer TIFF files, each with a resolution of 1km and British National Grid spatial reference system.

(2023). Input to Yield Ratio (IYR) values for wheat farming in England, 2010-2017. NERC Environmental Information Data Centre. <insert DOI here>. Data can be accessed via the Environmental Information Data Centre ( Example outputs Maps and frequency distributions of the Input to Yield Ratios over England are shown in Figure 1, as in Bullock et al. (2023). Figure 1. Frequency distributions and maps, at 1 km resolution, of the Input to Yield Ratios over England for two fertiliser-related and two pesticide-related inputs in relation to winter wheat yield. A higher value indicates greater potential harm for the wheat yield obtained. Colours in the maps match those in the histograms. No wheat was grown in the white areas Detailed methodology We assessed the winter wheat yields and potential harms from different agrochemicals applied to winter wheat crops across England, using spatially-explicit, national-extent estimates of variables, which we combined to calculate the IYR. All datasets were drawn from the period 2010-2017, although the different periodicity of agricultural surveys for yield, fertiliser and pesticide data, and the availability of Sentinel data for crop mapping, means that the datasets cover slightly different ranges within this period. We calculated single values averaged across years to increase the pool of available data. All maps (individual variables and IYR) were produced at 1 km resolution. We mapped estimated pesticide and fertiliser applications to winter wheat across England using data from the FERA Pesticide Utilisation Survey (FERA, 2022) and the British Survey of Fertiliser Practice (Defra, 2022), respectively. Areas with winter wheat crop were identified from the UKCEH Land Cover® plus: Crops map (2017). Estimated pesticide applications were converted to risk values to honeybees and earthworms using information on toxicity from the Pesticide Property Database (PPDB, 2022). Data from the June Survey of Agricultural and Horticultural activity (Defra, 2018) were used to create an average wheat yield map for England. We then compared the fertiliser and pesticide data separately to the estimated yields of wheat in order to derive the Input to Yield Ratio (IYR) for four separate harms: Nitrogen fertilisers, Phosphorus fertilisers, pesticide risk to earthworms, and pesticide risk to honeybees. An overview of the product creation process is shown in Figure 2. Please see Bullock et al. (2023) for a more in-depth methodology.

    "## 4. Sentence Segmentation\n",
    "After cleaning, the text remains in multi-sentence blocks that must be split into individual sentences for named entity recognition. Most NER models operate at the sentence level to preserve entity boundaries and reduce mislabelling across sentence breaks. Similarly, annotation tools and evaluation scripts typically expect input to follow a one-sentence-per-line format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence segmentation is therefore a necessary step between raw text preparation and downstream tasks such as annotation and model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The segmentation is performed using `spaCy`, a widely used NLP library that combines rule-based token patterns with statistical models to identify sentence boundaries. spaCy uses built-in language-specific rules to detect sentence breaks based on punctuation, orthographic features (e.g. capitalisation), and dependency parse structure. These heuristics work well for grammatically formal text such as scientific abstracts and technical reports, which make up the majority of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "No custom segmentation rules are added, as spaCy’s default model handles the structure of environmental science text with sufficient accuracy. Each cleaned text file is processed line by line. Paragraphs and document sections are passed through the sentence parser, and the resulting sentences are written out in plain text format, one per line. This structure ensures compatibility with common annotation formats while preserving the original sentence boundaries as accurately as possible."
