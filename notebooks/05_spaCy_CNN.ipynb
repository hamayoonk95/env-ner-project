    "# SpaCy CNN Model for Environmental NER\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Background and Purpose\n",
    "This notebook continues the model training phase of the environmental Named Entity Recognition (NER) pipeline. Following the baseline evaluation using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), we now transition to training a neural model using SpaCy’s convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "SpaCy’s built-in `tok2vec` + CNN pipeline offers a fast and compact neural alternative to classical sequence models. While less complex than transformer-based architectures, it retains the ability to model contextual features using a combination of static embeddings and convolutional filters. This makes it a practical next step in assessing how well a lightweight neural approach can generalise from rule-based annotations to unseen text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same annotated dataset is used here, comprising 735,542 sentences and over 1.2 million entity spans, labelled with five domain-specific entity types: TAXONOMY, HABITAT, ENV_PROCESS, POLLUTANT, and MEASUREMENT. The labels were generated using exact string matching against curated environmental vocabularies and follow the SpaCy `doc.ents` format rather than BIO tagging.\n",
    "\n",
    "This stage will help evaluate whether a neural network trained end-to-end on the raw text and entity spans can learn contextual patterns beyond surface string matches. It also establishes a reference point for comparing more advanced transformer-based models later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Objectives\n",
    "This notebook aims to train and evaluate a series of SpaCy CNN-based NER models, each with progressively stronger hyperparameters. These models are intended to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Serve as neural baselines that are more expressive than CRFs but faster than transformers.\n",
    "- Test whether convolutional features can generalise entity recognition beyond the rule-based matches.\n",
    "- Explore the impact of hyperparameters such as batch size, dropout, and training steps.\n",
    "- Identify how early SpaCy models perform on different entity types.\n",
    "- Prepare for subsequent experiments involving transformer-based architectures.\n"

   "source": [
    "## 2. Preparing the Dataset for SpaCy CNN\n",
    "\n",
    "The SpaCy CNN model expects training and evaluation data in its native binary format (`.spacy`), where each example contains raw text and associated entity spans stored in `doc.ents`. The dataset generated from the rule-based annotation pipeline was originally stored in `.jsonl` format, with each entry containing a sentence and a list of character-offset entity spans under the keys `\"text\"` and `\"label\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare this data for SpaCy’s training pipeline, the following steps are performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the annotated `.jsonl` file into memory.\n",
    "2. Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets using a 70/15/15 ratio.\n",
    "3. Convert each list of records into `DocBin` objects using `nlp.make_doc(...)` and character-span alignment.\n",
    "4. Save the converted data to `.spacy` files, which are required for use with SpaCy’s CLI training interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the CRF model, there is no need to convert to BIO tags explicitly, as SpaCy internally handles alignment between raw text and annotated entity spans during training. This makes the pipeline more streamlined while maintaining compatibility with downstream neural models.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step ensures the data is formatted efficiently for high-throughput model training and consistent evaluation."

    "### 3.2 SpaCy Model 2: Lower Dropout and Smaller Batch Size\n",
    "The second model `cnn_1` is designed to explore how a simpler NER classification head performs when given more training time. It retains the same CNN encoder as the baseline (`MaxoutWindowEncoder.v2` with width 128 and depth 4), but lowers the hidden width of the NER transition model to `32`. This reduces the number of parameters in the classification layer, helping test the model’s efficiency and generalisation when under tighter representational constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the baseline, this configuration also reduces `maxout_pieces` to `2`, meaning fewer activation combinations are computed at each layer. These changes together make the model lighter and more interpretable while preserving most of the upstream embedding logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dropout remains high `0.5` to maintain regularisation, as the smaller model is more likely to overfit quickly. However, the total number of training steps is increased to `20,000` (up from 2,000 in the baseline). This gives the lower-capacity architecture a fair opportunity to converge fully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early stopping is still enabled with a `patience of 1000 steps`, which means training will stop early if validation F1 does not improve for 1000 evaluation steps. This allows for longer training without overfitting or wasting compute unnecessarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other values such as learning rate (0.001) are kept constant, but the batch size is reduced to 500. This allows for more frequent model updates, which can be beneficial when training smaller architectures. Smaller batches introduce additional noise into the gradient updates, acting as an implicit regulariser and helping the model escape sharp minima. This setup gives the model more chances to refine its weights across a longer training horizon, especially useful when early stopping is enabled."

    "### 3.3 SpaCy Model 3: Shallower Encoder with Lower Dropout\n",
    "This third model (`cnn_2`) explores the effect of simplifying the architecture by reducing both the encoder depth and the dropout rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The encoder depth is reduced from 4 to 2. This limits how many convolutional layers the model uses to extract contextual features. It makes the model faster to train and potentially more generalisable on simpler patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout is lowered from 0.5 to 0.3. Because the encoder is already smaller, using high dropout could cause underfitting. A moderate value maintains regularisation while allowing the model to learn from more of the training signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "All other values stay the same as the previous model. These include a batch size of 500, a learning rate of 0.001, and a total of 20,000 training steps with early stopping patience set to 1,000. This lets the model train long enough while stopping early if the validation score does not improve.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup helps assess how well a shallower network can perform with milder regularisation."
